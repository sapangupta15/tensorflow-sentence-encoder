Item 1A. Risk Factors   

Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business  

Our businesses have been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.  

The capital and credit markets since 2008 have experienced unprecedented levels of volatility and disruption. In some cases, the markets produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength.  

Dramatic declines in the housing market during recent years, with falling home prices, increased numbers of foreclosures and higher levels of unemployment and under-employment, have adversely affected the credit performance of real estate-related loans and resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant write-downs of asset values by us and other financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other securities and loans, have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to reduce or eliminate dividends, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced, and in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers, including financial institutions.  

Although the economic slowdown that the United States experienced has begun to reverse and the markets have generally improved, business activities across a wide range of industries continue to face serious difficulties due to the lack of consumer spending and demand. Continued weakness in or a worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we do business could have one or more of the following adverse effects on our business:  

       A decrease in the demand for, or the availability of, loans and other products and services offered by us;  

       A decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate;  

       An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill;  

       A decrease in interest income from variable rate loans, due to declines in interest rates; and  

       An increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provisions for loan losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.  

Overall, during the past several years, the general business environment has had an adverse effect on our business. Although the general business environment has shown some improvement, there can be no assurance that it will continue to improve. Additionally, the improvement of certain economic indicators, such as real estate asset values and rents and unemployment, may vary between geographic markets and may continue to lag behind improvement in the overall economy. These economic indicators typically affect certain industries, such as real estate and financial services, more significantly than other economic sectors. For example, improvements in commercial real estate fundamentals typically lag broad economic recovery by twelve to eighteen months. Our clients include entities active in the real estate and financial services industries. Furthermore, financial services companies with a substantial lending business, like ours, are dependent upon the ability of their borrowers to make debt service payments on loans. If economic conditions worsen or remain volatile, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Concerns about the European Unions sovereign debt and the future of the euro have also caused uncertainty for financial markets globally. Such risks could indirectly affect us by affecting our hedging or other counterparties, as well as our customers with European businesses or assets denominated in the euro or companies in our markets with European businesses or affiliates.

Ineffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition.  

Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated or difficult credit markets. Our access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors. In particular, a majority of our liabilities during 2012 were checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days notice, while by comparison, a substantial majority of our assets were loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  

Our operations are concentrated in the Southeastern United States, and adverse changes in the economic conditions in this region can adversely affect our performance and credit quality.  

Our operations are concentrated in the Southeastern United States, particularly in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee. As a result, local economic conditions in the Southeastern United States can significantly affect the demand for the products offered by Regions Bank (including real estate, commercial and construction loans), the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Since 2008, the national real estate market has experienced a significant decline in value, and the value of real estate in the Southeastern United States in particular declined significantly more than real estate values in the United States as a whole. This decline has had an adverse impact on some of our borrowers and on the value of the collateral securing many of our loans. This decline may continue to affect borrowers and collateral values, which could adversely affect our currently performing loans, leading to future delinquencies or defaults and increases in our provision for loan losses. Further or continued adverse changes in these economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  

Hurricanes and other weather-related events, as well as man-made disasters, could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.  

A significant portion of our operations are located in the areas bordering the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, regions that are susceptible to hurricanes, or in areas of the Southeastern United States that are susceptible to tornadoes and other severe weather events. Such weather events can cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. We maintain hurricane insurance, including coverage for lost profits and extra expense; however, there is no insurance against the disruption that a catastrophic hurricane could produce to the markets that we serve. Further, a hurricane or severe tornado in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely affect the value of any collateral held by us. Man-made disasters and other events connected with the Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic Ocean, such as the 2010 Gulf oil spill, could have similar effects. Some of the states in which we operate have in recent years experienced extreme droughts. The severity and impact of future hurricanes, severe tornadoes, droughts and other weather-related events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change. The effects of past or future hurricanes, severe tornadoes, droughts and other weather-related events, as well as man-made disasters, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Continued weakness in the residential real estate markets could adversely affect our performance.  

As of December 31, 2012, consumer residential real estate loans represented approximately 33.5 percent of our total loan portfolio. This portion of our loan portfolio has been under pressure for several years as disruptions in the financial markets and the deterioration in housing markets and general economic conditions have caused a decline in home values, real estate market demand and the credit quality of borrowers. Any further declines in home values would adversely affect the value of collateral securing the residential real estate that we hold, as well as the volume of loan originations and the amount we realize on sale of real estate loans. These factors could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  

Continued weakness in the commercial real estate markets could adversely affect our performance.  

Facing continuing pressure from reduced asset values, high vacancy rates and reduced rents, the fundamentals within the commercial real estate sector also remain weak. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 10.4 percent of our loan portfolio consisted of investor real estate loans. The properties securing income-producing investor real estate loans are typically not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrowers ability to repay the loan is instead dependent upon additional leasing through the life of the loan or the borrowers successful operation of a business. Weak economic conditions may impair a borrowers business operations and typically slow the execution of new leases. Such economic conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover. As a result of these factors, vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space may remain at elevated levels in 2013. High vacancy rates could result in rents falling further over the next several quarters. The combination of these factors could result in further deterioration in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market and the deterioration in value of some of our loans. Any such deterioration could adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to repay the amounts due under their loans. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  

If we experience greater credit losses in our loan portfolios than anticipated, our earnings may be materially adversely affected.  

As a lender, we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.  

We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for estimated credit losses based on a number of factors. Our management periodically determines the allowance for loan losses based on available information, including the quality of the loan portfolio, economic conditions, the value of the underlying collateral and the level of non-accrual loans. Increases in this allowance will result in an expense for the period, thereby reducing our reported net income. If, as a result of general economic conditions, a decrease in asset quality or growth in the loan portfolio, our management determines that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses are necessary, we may incur additional expenses which will reduce our net income, and our business, results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected.  

Although our management will establish an allowance for loan losses it believes is appropriate to absorb probable and reasonably estimable losses in our loan portfolio, this allowance may not be adequate. In particular, if a hurricane or other natural disaster were to occur in one of our principal markets or if economic conditions in those markets were to deteriorate unexpectedly, additional loan losses not incorporated in the existing allowance for loan losses may occur. Losses in excess of the existing allowance for loan losses will reduce our net income and could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition, perhaps materially.  

In addition, bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance for loan losses and the value attributed to non-accrual loans and to real estate acquired through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may

 require us to adjust our determination of the value for these items. These adjustments could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  

Risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien position could materially adversely affect our performance.  

Home equity products, particularly those where we are in a second lien position, and particularly those in certain geographic areas, may carry a higher risk of non-collection than other loans. Home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit. Of our $11.8 billion home equity portfolio at December 31, 2012, approximately $10.4 billion were home equity lines of credit and $1.4 billion were closed-end home equity loans (primarily originated as amortizing loans). This type of lending, which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrowers residence, allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home. Real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended, and, in addition, past and future changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses. Second lien position lending carries higher credit risk because any decrease in real estate pricing may result in the value of the collateral being insufficient to cover the second lien after the first lien position has been satisfied. We have realized higher levels of charge-offs on second lien positions, particularly in the state of Florida, where real estate valuations have been depressed over the past several years. As of December 31, 2012, approximately $6.2 billion of our home equity lines and loans were in a second lien position (approximately $2.4 billion in Florida).  

We are unable to track payment status on first liens held by another institution, including payment status related to loan modifications. When our second lien position becomes delinquent, an attempt is made to contact the first lien holder and inquire as to the payment status of the first lien. However, we do not continuously monitor the payment status of the first lien position. Short sale offers and settlement agreements are often received by the home equity junior lien holders well before the loan balance reaches the delinquency threshold for charge-off consideration, potentially resulting in a full balance payoff/charge-off. We are presently monitoring the status of all first lien position loans that we own or service and also own a second lien, and we are taking appropriate action when delinquent. During 2012, we evaluated a means to monitor non-Regions-serviced first liens using a third-party service provider and found that the delinquency rates were not material. As of December 31, 2012, none of our home equity lines of credit have converted to mandatory amortization under the contractual terms. The majority of home equity lines of credit will either mature with a balloon payment or convert to amortizing status after fiscal year 2020.  

Industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success.  

Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits. In our market areas, we face competition from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, Internet banks, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern Regions or Regions Bank and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes, such as the repeal in 2011 of all federal prohibitions on the payment by depository institutions of interest on demand deposit accounts and the repeal in 2010 of all prohibitions on interstate branching by depository institutions. Should competition in the financial services industry intensify, our ability to effectively market our products and services and to retain or compete for new business may be adversely affected. Consequently, our business, financial condition or results of operations may also be adversely affected, perhaps materially.  

Rapid and significant changes in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance.  

Fluctuations in interest rates may adversely impact our business. Our profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income received on interest-earning  

25  

Table of Contents 

 assets (primarily loans and investment securities) and the interest expense incurred in connection with interest-bearing liabilities (primarily deposits and borrowings). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities which, in turn, are impacted by external factors such as the local economy, competition for loans and deposits, the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System (the FOMC) and market interest rates.  

The cost of our deposits and short-term wholesale borrowings is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is driven primarily by the FOMCs actions. However, the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by longer-term interest rates, which are set by the market through benchmark interest rates such as the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR) or, at times, the FOMCs actions, and generally vary from day to day. The level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur. Interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios. If the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-earning assets, our net interest income may decline and, with it, a decline in our earnings may occur. Our net interest income and earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest-earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interest-bearing liabilities. In particular, short-term interest rates are currently very low by historical standards, with many benchmark rates, such as the federal funds rate and the one- and three-month LIBOR near zero. These low rates have reduced our cost of funding which has caused our net interest margin to increase.  

Our current one-year interest rate sensitivity position is moderately asset sensitive, meaning that an immediate or gradual increase in interest rates would likely have a positive cumulative impact on Regions twelve-month net interest income. Alternatively, an immediate or gradual decrease in rates over a twelve-month period would likely have a negative impact on twelve-month net interest income.  

An increasing interest rate environment would also increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers. Such increases may adversely affect those borrowers ability to pay as contractually obligated and could result in additional delinquencies or charge-offs. Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result.  

For a more detailed discussion of these risks and our management strategies for these risks, see the Net Interest Income and Margin, Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk and Securities sections of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Obligations currently rated below investment grade as well as possible future reductions in our credit ratings may increase our funding costs, place limitations on business activities related to providing credit support to customers, or contribute to ineffective liquidity management.  

The major rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. From 2008 through 2010, all of the major ratings agencies downgraded Regions and Regions Banks credit ratings and many issued negative outlooks. Negative watch, negative outlook or other similar terms mean that a future downgrade is possible. From August 2011 through October 2012, however, four major rating agencies, Standard & Poors (S&P), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moodys Investor Services (Moodys) and Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS), upwardly revised their outlook of Regions from negative to stable and/or positive reflecting the Companys continued improvement in earnings performance, core capital position, and maintenance of a strong liquidity profile. Subsequent to the upward revision on their outlook, in March 2012, S&P upgraded the credit ratings of Regions and Regions Bank (including an upgrade of Regions senior debt rating from BB+ to BBB-) following Regions March 2012 stock offering and redemption of 3.5 million shares of Series A preferred stock  

26

 issued to the U.S. Treasury. Additionally, in March 2012 Fitch conducted a global review of securities impacted in part by capital requirements set forth in Basel III as well as Fitchs view regarding the likelihood of sovereign support. The review resulted in a downgrade of Regions junior subordinated debt rating from BB to B+. In December 2012, Moodys upgraded Regions senior debt ratings from Ba3 to Ba1, citing declining net charge-offs and loan delinquencies, as well as enhancements to the risk management structure. Currently, Regions senior debt ratings are Ba1, BBB-, BBB- and BBB by Moodys, S&P, Fitch and DBRS, respectively.  

In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix and level and quality of earnings, and we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings. The ratings assigned to Regions and Regions Bank remain subject to change at any time, and it is possible that any ratings agency will take action to downgrade Regions, Regions Bank or both in the future.  

Additionally, ratings agencies may also make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices which may affect our credit ratings. In the future, changes to existing ratings guidelines and new ratings guidelines may, among other things, adversely affect the ratings of our securities or other securities in which we have an economic interest.  

Regions credit ratings can have negative consequences that can impact our ability to access the debt and capital markets, as well as reduce our profitability through increased costs on future debt issuances. Specifically, when Regions was downgraded below investment grade status, we became unable to reliably access the short-term unsecured funding markets, which caused us to hold more cash and liquid investments to meet our on-going cash needs. Such actions reduced our profitability as these liquid investments earned a lower return than other assets, such as loans. Regions liquidity policy requires that we maintain a minimum cash requirement that is the greater of the next two years of corporate dividend payments and debt service and maturities less the next one year of bank dividends, or the next one year of corporate dividend payments and debt service and maturities. The current working limit does not allow the minimum cash requirement to fall below $500 million. The conservative nature of this policy helps protect us against the costs of unexpected adverse funding environments. Future issuances of debt could cost Regions more in interest costs were such debt to be issued at our current debt rating. Any future downgrades would further increase the interest costs associated with potential future borrowings, the cost of which cannot be estimated due to the uncertainty of future issuances in terms of amount and priority.  

Additionally, at the time Regions was downgraded to below investment grade, certain counterparty contracts were required to be renegotiated, resulting in additional collateral postings of approximately $200 million. Refer to Note 20, Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities, Contingent Features to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fair value of contracts subject to contingent credit features and the collateral postings associated with such contracts. Future downgrades could require Regions to post additional collateral. While the exact amount of additional collateral is unknown, it is reasonable to conclude that Regions may be required to post approximately an additional $200 million related to existing contracts with contingent credit features. In early 2013, as a result of the ratings upgrades that occurred during 2012, approximately $70 million of this additional collateral has been returned to Regions. If due to future downgrades, we were required to cancel our derivatives contracts with certain counterparties and were unable to replace such contracts, our market risk profile could be altered. Regions believes that this market risk exposure would be immaterial to its consolidated financial position, liquidity and results of operations.  

The value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.  

As of December 31, 2012, we had $4.8 billion of goodwill and $345 million of other intangible assets. A significant decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock, any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein, may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill. Future regulatory actions could also have a material impact on  

27  

Table of Contents 

 assessments of goodwill for impairment. If the fair value of our net assets improves at a faster rate than the market value of our reporting units, or if we were to experience increases in book values of a reporting unit in excess of the increase in fair value of equity, we may also have to take charges related to the impairment of our goodwill. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of our goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A goodwill impairment charge is a non-cash item that does not have an adverse impact on regulatory capital.  

Identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill consist of core deposit intangibles, purchased credit card relationship assets, and customer relationship employment assets. Adverse events or circumstances could impact the recoverability of these intangible assets including loss of core deposits, significant losses of credit card accounts and/or balances, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent these intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable, a non-cash impairment charge would be recorded.  

The value of our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our operating results and regulatory capital ratios.  

As of December 31, 2012, Regions had approximately $763 million in net deferred tax assets, of which $35 million was disallowed when calculating regulatory capital. Our deferred tax assets are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes. In making this determination, we consider all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results as well as potential carryback of tax to prior years taxable income, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and projected earnings within the statutory tax loss carryover period. We have determined that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized at December 31, 2012 (except for $70 million related to state deferred tax assets for which we have established a valuation allowance). If we were to conclude that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets were not more likely than not to be realized, the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and regulatory capital ratios.  

Changes in the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.  

Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. Furthermore, although we do not hold any European sovereign debt, we may do business with and be exposed to financial institutions that have been affected by the recent European sovereign debt crisis. As a result, defaults by, or even mere speculation about, one or more financial services companies, or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. We are unable to make assurances that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  

Potential limitations on incentive compensation contained in proposed federal agency rulemaking may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain our highest performing employees.  

In April 2011, the Federal Reserve, other federal banking agencies and the Securities and Exchange Commission jointly published proposed rules designed to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act prohibiting incentive compensation arrangements that would encourage inappropriate risk taking at covered financial institutions, which includes a bank or bank holding company with $1 billion or more of assets, such as  

28  

Table of Contents 

 Regions and Regions Bank. It cannot be determined at this time whether or when a final rule will be adopted and whether compliance with such a final rule will substantially affect the manner in which we structure compensation for our executives and other employees. Depending on the nature and application of the final rules, we may not be able to successfully compete with certain financial institutions and other companies that are not subject to some or all of the rules to retain and attract executives and other high performing employees. If this were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, perhaps materially.  

Maintaining or increasing market share may depend on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services.  

Our success depends, in part, on the ability to adapt products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. This can reduce net interest income and noninterest income from fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology, or those new products may not achieve market acceptance. As a result, we could lose business, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, or be subject to cost increases. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.  

We need to stay current on technological changes in order to compete and meet customer demands.  

The financial services market, including banking services, is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better serving customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and may enable us to reduce costs. Our future success may depend, in part, on our ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we currently have. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. As a result, our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired, and our business, financial condition or results of operations, may be adversely affected.  

Our customers may pursue alternatives to bank deposits which could force us to rely on relatively more expensive sources of funding.  

We may experience an outflow of deposits because customers seek investments with higher yields or greater financial stability; prefer to do business with our competitors, or otherwise. This outflow of deposits could force us to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to fund our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin. We may also be forced, as a result of any outflow of deposits, to rely more heavily on equity to fund our business, resulting in greater dilution of our existing shareholders. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.  

We are subject to a variety of operational risks, environmental, legal and compliance risks, and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.  

We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion  

29  

Table of Contents 

 can adversely affect our ability to attract and keep customers and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Actual or alleged conduct by Regions can also result in negative public opinion about our other businesses. Negative public opinion could also affect our credit ratings, which are important to our access to unsecured wholesale borrowings.  

If personal, non-public, confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be misappropriated, mishandled or misused, we could suffer significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage and financial loss. Such mishandling or misuse could include, for example, erroneously providing such information to parties who are not permitted to have the information, either by fault of our systems, employees, or counterparties, or the interception or inappropriate acquisition of such information by third parties.  

Because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified. Our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We also may be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters, disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets) which may give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability. We are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are) and to the risk that our (or our vendors) business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate. The occurrence of any of these risks could result in our diminished ability to operate our business (for example, by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect), as well as potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, perhaps materially.  

We are subject to a variety of systems failure and cyber-security risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance.  

Failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our businesses or the businesses of our customers, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and cause losses. As a large financial institution, we depend on our ability to process, record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis. As customer, public and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers.  

Information security risks for large financial institutions such as Regions have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties. As noted above, our operations rely on the secure processing, transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers may use personal smartphones, tablet PCs, and other  

30

 mobile devices that are beyond our control systems. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and controls, our technologies, systems, networks and our customers devices may be the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Regions or our customers confidential, proprietary and other information. Additionally, cyber attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking or terrorist activities, could disrupt Regions or our customers or other third parties business operations. For example, in October 2012 and December 2012, a group launched denial of service attacks against a number of large financial services institutions. Regions was targeted by this group in October and December. These events did not result in a breach of Regions client data, and account information remained secure; however, the attacks did adversely affect the performance of Regions Banks website, www.regions.com, and, in some instances, prevented customers from accessing Regions Banks secure websites for consumer and commercial applications. The October event was resolved within approximately one day. The December events occurred over multiple days, but each individual event was of a shorter duration than the October event and was promptly resolved. In all cases, the attacks primarily resulted in inconvenience; however, future cyber attacks could be more disruptive and damaging, and Regions may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks.  

Third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.  

Our risk and exposure to cyber attacks and other information security breaches remain heightened because of, among other things, the evolving nature of these threats and the prevalence of Internet and mobile banking. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber attacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services, could result in customer attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs and/or additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  

We rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.  

Third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing, recording and monitoring transactions, online banking interfaces and services, Internet connections and network access. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. Any problems caused by these third parties, including those resulting from disruptions in communication services provided by a vendor, failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes, or failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason or poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise conduct our business. Financial or operational difficulties of a third party vendor could also hurt our operations if those difficulties interfere with the vendors ability to serve us. Replacing these third party vendors could also create significant delay and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations.  

We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties.  

In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors if made available. If this information is inaccurate, we may be subject to regulatory action, reputational harm or other adverse effects with respect to the operation of our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.

We are exposed to risk of environmental liability when we take title to property.  

In the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. As a result, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.  

Our reported financial results depend on managements selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.  

Our accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to our reported financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect managements judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in us reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.  

Certain accounting policies are critical to presenting our reported financial condition and results. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include: the allowance for credit losses; fair value measurements; intangible assets; mortgage servicing rights; and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided; recognize significant impairment on our goodwill, other intangible assets or deferred tax asset balances; or significantly increase our accrued income taxes.  

Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.  

From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in us restating prior period financial statements. For example, on December 20, 2012, the FASB issued for public comment a Proposed Accounting Standards Update, Financial Instruments  Credit Losses (Subtopic 825-15), that would substantially change the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks, financial institutions and other organizations. The proposal would remove the existing probable threshold in GAAP for recognizing credit losses and instead require affected reporting companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses on financial assets over the lifetime of each such asset, broadening the range of information that must be considered in measuring the allowance for expected credit losses. This proposal, if adopted as proposed, will likely have a negative impact, potentially material, on Regions reported earnings and capital and could also have an impact on Regions Banks lending to the extent that higher reserves are required at the inception of a loan based on recent loan loss experience.

Risks Arising From the Legal and Regulatory Framework in which Our Business Operates  

Increased litigation could result in legal liability and damage to our reputation.  

We and certain of our subsidiaries have been named from time to time as defendants in various class actions and other litigation relating to their business and activities. Past, present and future litigation have included or could include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We and certain of our subsidiaries are also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our and their business. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.  

In addition, in recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed lender liability. Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.  

Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us or our subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations or cause significant harm to our reputation. Additional information relating to litigation affecting Regions and our subsidiaries is discussed in Note 23 Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

We may face significant claims for indemnification in connection with our sale of Morgan Keegan in 2012.  

On January 11, 2012, Regions entered into a stock purchase agreement to sell Morgan Keegan and related affiliates to Raymond James Financial, Inc. (Raymond James). The transaction closed on April 2, 2012. In connection with the closing of the sale, Regions agreed to indemnify Raymond James for all litigation and certain other matters related to pre-closing activities of Morgan Keegan. Indemnifiable losses under the indemnification provision include legal and other expenses, such as costs for defense, judgments, settlements and awards associated with the resolution of litigation related to pre-closing activities. As of December 31, 2012 the carrying value of the indemnification obligation is approximately $345 million. This amount reflects an estimate of liability, and actual liabilities can potentially be higher than amounts reserved. The amount of liability that we may ultimately incur from indemnification claims may have an adverse impact, perhaps materially, on our results of operations.  

We are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which could have an adverse impact on our operations.  

The banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state law. Regions and Regions Bank are subject to the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Superintendent of Banking of the State of Alabama. These regulations are intended primarily to protect depositors, the public and the FDIC insurance fund, and not our shareholders. These regulations govern a variety of matters, including certain debt obligations, changes in control of bank holding companies and state-chartered banks, maintenance of adequate capital by bank holding companies and state-chartered banks, and general business operations and financial condition of Regions and Regions Bank (including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments, the amount of reserves against deposits, restrictions on dividends, establishment of branch offices, and the maximum interest rate that may be charged by law). Additionally, all of our non-bank subsidiaries are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve, and certain of our other subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by other regulatory authorities, such as state insurance departments.  

As a result, we are subject to changes in federal and state law, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles. Regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous review and frequently change, and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be  

33  

Table of Contents 

 predicted. Regulations and laws may be modified at any time, and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us, Regions Bank and our subsidiaries. Any changes in any federal and state law, as well as regulations and governmental policies, income tax laws and accounting principles, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including ways which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Failure to appropriately comply with any such laws, regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our regulatory position is discussed in greater detail under the Bank Regulatory Capital Requirements section and associated Capital Ratios table of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Recent legislation regarding the financial services industry may have a significant adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.  

The Dodd-Frank Act became law in July 2010. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will directly affect our ability to conduct our business including:  

       Imposition of higher prudential standards, including more stringent risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and risk-management requirements, and numerous other requirements on systemically significant institutions, including all bank holding companies with assets of at least $50 billion (which includes Regions);  

       Establishment of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify and impose additional regulatory oversight of large financial firms;  

       Imposition of additional costs and fees, including fees to be set by the Federal Reserve and charged to systemically significant institutions to cover the cost of regulating such institutions and any FDIC assessment made to cover the costs of any regular or special examination of Regions or its affiliates;  

       Establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations and to examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer laws;  

       Application to bank holding companies of regulatory capital requirements similar to those applied to banks, which requirements exclude, on a phase-out basis, all trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred stock from Tier 1 capital; and  

       Establishment of new rules and restrictions regarding the origination of mortgages.  

Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective in July 2011, on the one-year anniversary of its enactment. However, a number of these other provisions still require extensive rulemaking, guidance and interpretation by regulatory authorities and have extended implementation periods and delayed effective dates. Accordingly, in some respects, the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and its effect on Regions and the U.S. financial system generally may not be known for some time.  

The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any future rules adopted to implement those provisions as well as any additional legislative or regulatory changes may impact the profitability of our business activities and costs of operations, require that we change certain of our business practices, materially affect our business model or affect retention of key personnel, require us to raise additional regulatory capital, including additional Tier 1 capital, and could expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). These and other changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our results of operations or financial condition.  

Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect our earnings.  

Our deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, we are subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We generally cannot control the amount of premiums we will be required to pay for FDIC  

34  

Table of Contents 

 insurance. High levels of bank failures over the past several years and increases in the statutory deposit insurance limits have increased resolution costs to the FDIC and put pressure on the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore the reserve ratios of the DIF, the FDIC increased assessment rates on insured institutions, charged a special assessment to all insured institutions as of June 30, 2009, and required banks to prepay three years worth of premiums on December 30, 2009. If there are additional financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels, or the FDIC may charge additional special assessments. Further, the FDIC increased the DIFs target reserve ratio to 2.0 percent of insured deposits following the Dodd-Frank Acts elimination of the 1.5 percent cap on the DIFs reserve ratio. Additional increases in our assessment rate may be required in the future to achieve this targeted reserve ratio. These increases in deposit assessments and any future increases, required prepayments or special assessments of FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  

Additionally, in February 2011, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC amended its regulations regarding assessment for federal deposit insurance to base such assessments on the average total consolidated assets of the insured institution during the assessment period, less the average tangible equity of the institution during the assessment period. The FDIC also adopted a revised risk-based assessment calculation in February 2011. In January 2010, the FDIC proposed a rule tying assessment rates of FDIC insured institutions to the institutions employee compensation programs. Comments were due on February 18, 2010, but as of February 2013, no final rule has been adopted. The exact nature and cumulative effect of these recent changes are not yet known, but they may increase the amount of premiums we must pay for FDIC insurance. Any such increases may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  

We may be subject to more stringent capital requirements.  

Regions and Regions Bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. In light of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements contained in the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Reserves proposed rules implementing regulatory accords on international banking institutions formulated as part of the Basel Committee III process, we expect to be required to satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy and liquidity standards. We may also be required to satisfy additional, more stringent capital adequacy and liquidity standards than those specified as part of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal Reserves proposed rules implementing Basel III, or comply with the requirements of these standards earlier than might otherwise be required, in order to successfully comply with the capital planning and stress test rules and guidance issued by the Federal Reserve. The ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on us cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including the treatment and implementation by the U.S. banking regulators. These requirements, however, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. For more information concerning our compliance with capital and liquidity requirements, see the Bank Regulatory Capital Requirements section of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Unfavorable results from ongoing stress analyses conducted on Regions may adversely affect our ability to retain customers or compete for new business opportunities.  

Under the final rules discussed under Regulatory Reforms  Federal Reserves Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review in the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Federal Reserve conducts an annual stress analysis of Regions to evaluate our ability to absorb losses in various economic and financial scenarios. This stress analysis uses three economic and financial scenarios  

35  

Table of Contents 

 generated by the Federal Reserve, including adverse and severely adverse scenarios. The rules also require us to conduct our own semi-annual stress analysis to assess the potential impact on Regions, including our consolidated earnings, losses and capital, under each of the economic and financial scenarios used as part of the Federal Reserves annual stress analysis. A summary of the results of certain aspects of the Federal Reserves annual stress analysis is released publicly and contains bank holding company specific information and results. The rules also require us to disclose publicly a summary of the results of our semi-annual stress analyses, and Regions Banks annual stress analyses, under the severely adverse scenario.  

Although the stress tests are not meant to assess our current condition, and even if we remain strong, stable and well capitalized, we cannot predict our customers potential misinterpretation of, and adverse reaction to, the results of these stress tests. Any potential misinterpretations and adverse reactions could limit our ability to attract and retain customers or to effectively compete for new business opportunities. The inability to attract and retain customers or effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  

Additionally, our regulators may require us to raise additional capital or take other actions, or may impose restrictions on our business, based on the results of the stress tests, including rejecting or requiring revisions to our annual capital plan submitted in connection with the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review. We may not be able to raise additional capital if required to do so, or may not be able to do so on terms which are advantageous to Regions or its current shareholders. Any such capital raises, if required, may also be dilutive to our existing shareholders.  

If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bank holding company or non-bank financial company were triggered, we could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund.  

The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new mechanism, the OLA, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. The OLA is administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDICs bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority only after consultation with the President of the United States and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the Orderly Liquidation Fund, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as Regions. Any such assessments may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  

Risks Related to Our Capital Stock  

The market price of shares of our capital stock will fluctuate.  

The market price of our capital stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects. Such risks may be affected by:  

       Our operating performance, financial condition and prospects, or the operating performance, financial condition and prospects of our competitors;  

       Operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;  

       Our creditworthiness;  

       Developments in our business or in the financial sector generally;  

       Regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations;  

       The operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;  

36  

Table of Contents 

       Announcements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors;  

       Expectations of or actual equity dilution;  

       Whether we declare or fail to declare dividends on our capital stock from time to time;  

       The ratings given to our securities by credit-rating agencies;  

       Changes in the credit, mortgage and real estate markets, including the markets for mortgage-related securities; and  

       Changes in global financial markets, global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.  

Stock markets in general (and our common stock in particular) have shown considerable volatility in the recent past. The market price of our capital stock, including our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock, may continue to be subject to similar fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Increased volatility could result in a decline in the market price of our capital stock.  

Our capital stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness.  

Our capital stock, including our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock, ranks junior to all of Regions existing and future indebtedness and Regions other non-equity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us, including claims in the event of our liquidation. As of December 31, 2012, Regions total liabilities were approximately $105.8 billion, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to increase our capital resources. Additionally, if our capital ratios or the capital ratios of Regions Bank fall below the required minimums, we or Regions Bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt securities, including medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes or other applicable securities.  

We are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.  

We are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt, is dividends from Regions Bank. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by Regions Bank to us, as well as by us to our stockholders. Regulations of both the Federal Reserve and the State of Alabama affect the ability of Regions Bank to pay dividends and other distributions to us and to make loans to us. If Regions Bank is unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common and preferred stockholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt. See the Stockholders Equity section of Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary, except to the extent that any of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized. As a result, shares of our capital stock are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries. At December 31, 2012, our subsidiaries total deposits and borrowings were approximately $98.8 billion.  

We may not pay dividends on shares of our capital stock.  

Holders of shares of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash  

37  

Table of Contents 

 dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  

On November 1, 2012, Regions completed the sale of 20 million depositary shares each representing a 1/40th ownership interest in a share of its 6.375% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $1.00 per share (Series A Preferred Stock), with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Series A Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25 per depositary share). Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are discretionary and are not cumulative. If our Board of Directors does not declare a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock in respect of a quarterly dividend period, then no dividend shall be deemed to have accrued for such dividend period, no dividend shall be payable on the applicable dividend payment date or be cumulative, and we will have no obligation to pay any dividend for that dividend period, whether or not our Board of Directors declares a dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock or any other class or series of our capital stock for any future dividend period.  

Furthermore, the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock prohibit Regions from declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of its capital stock, including its common stock, or from repurchasing, redeeming or acquiring such junior stock, unless Regions has declared and paid full dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock for the most recently completed dividend period. Additionally, the terms of Regions outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit it from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on Regions capital stock, or purchasing, acquiring or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if Regions has given notice of its election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing.  

Regions is also subject to statutory and regulatory limitations on its ability to pay dividends on its capital stock. For example, it is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs, asset quality and financial condition. Moreover, the Federal Reserve will closely scrutinize any dividend payout ratios exceeding 30 percent of after-tax net income. Additionally, while the impact of many of its provisions are not yet known, the Dodd-Frank Act requires federal banking agencies to establish more stringent risk-based capital guidelines and leverage limits applicable to banks and bank holding companies, and especially those institutions with consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion. In August 2012, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency jointly published three proposed rules that would substantially revise the federal banking agencies current capital rules and implement the Basel Committee on Banking Supervisions December 2010 regulatory capital reforms, known as Basel III. The proposed rules, if adopted as proposed, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or may result in additional limitations on our ability to pay dividends on shares of our capital stock.  

Pursuant to rules adopted in November 2011, the Federal Reserve has required bank holding companies with $50 billion or more of total consolidated assets, such as Regions, to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve for review before they can make capital distributions such as dividends. The Federal Reserve did not object to Regions capital plan that was submitted in January 2012; however, if the Federal Reserve does not approve any subsequent Regions capital plan, Regions may not be able to declare dividends.  

Our management and Board of Directors, as part of the capital planning process, will continue to evaluate the payment of dividends in conjunction with our regulatory supervisors, and subject to applicable regulations and other limitations, as well as Regions results of operations.  

Anti-takeover laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect share value.  

Certain provisions of state and federal law and our certificate of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us without our Board of Directors approval. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring control of  

38  

Table of Contents 

 a bank holding company. Acquisition of 10 percent or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or state member bank, including shares of our common stock, creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer controls the bank holding company or state member bank. Also, as noted under the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5 percent of the voting shares of any bank, including Regions Bank. There also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. For example, holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have certain voting rights that could adversely affect share value. If and when dividends on the preferred stock have not been declared and paid for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the authorized number of directors then constituting our Board of Directors will automatically be increased by two, and the preferred stockholders will be entitled to elect the two additional directors. Also, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of all of the then-outstanding shares of the preferred stock is required to consummate a binding share-exchange or reclassification involving the preferred stock, or a merger or consolidation of Regions with or into another entity, unless certain requirements are met. These statutory provisions and provisions in our certificate of incorporation, including the rights of the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, could result in Regions being less attractive to a potential acquirer.  

We may need to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future; such capital may be dilutive to our existing shareholders or may not be available when needed or at all.  

We may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance. The economic slowdown and loss of confidence in financial institutions over the past several years may increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve. Additionally, some of our long-term debt securities are currently rated below investment grade by certain of the credit ratings agencies. Any such ratings may affect our cost of funding and limit our access to the capital markets.  

We cannot assure you that capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of Regions Bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets, or a downgrade of our debt ratings, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  

Future issuances of additional equity securities could result in dilution of existing stockholders equity ownership.  

We may determine from time to time to issue additional equity securities to raise additional capital, support growth, or to make acquisitions. Further, we may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate our employees. These issuances of our securities could dilute the voting and economic interests of our existing shareholders.
