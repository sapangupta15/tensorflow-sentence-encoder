ITEM 7.    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

 INTRODUCTION  

 Illinois Tool Works Inc. (the Company or ITW) is a multinational manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with approximately 840 operations in 57 countries. These 840 businesses are internally reported as 60 operating segments to senior management. The Companys 60 operating segments have been aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments: Transportation; Industrial Packaging; Food Equipment; Power Systems & Electronics; Construction Products; Polymers & Fluids; Decorative Surfaces; and All Other.  

 In August 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Decorative Surfaces segment which was subsequently classified as a discontinued operation. In May 2009, the Companys Board of Directors rescinded its earlier resolution to divest the Decorative Surfaces segment and, accordingly, all periods presented have been restated to present the Decorative Surfaces segment as a continuing operation.  

 Due to the large number of diverse businesses and the Companys highly decentralized operating style, the Company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results. Instead, the Companys corporate management collects data on several key measurements: operating revenues, operating income, operating margins, overhead costs, number of months on hand in inventory, days sales outstanding in accounts receivable, past due receivables and return on invested capital. These key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management.  

 The results of each segment are analyzed by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses, newly acquired companies, restructuring costs, goodwill and intangible impairment charges, and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment. Base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the Companys results of operations for more than 12 months. The changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs. Operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue changes on operating income, assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period. As manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing, the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues.  

 A key element of the Companys business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Companys 840 operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:  

       Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value products.   

       Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.   

       Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.   

       Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.    

 The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results.

 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 The Companys consolidated results of operations for 2009, 2008 and 2007 are summarized as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues decreased 18.8% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, mainly due to the strengthening of the dollar, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. Total base revenues declined 18.4% in 2009 versus 2008. Base revenues declined 21.6% and 14.9% for North American and international businesses, respectively, as both were adversely affected by the global recession and weak industrial production in related end markets throughout 2009. The Company anticipates modest expansion in a variety of worldwide end markets in 2010.  

 Revenues increased 6.1% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation in the first three quarters of 2008, due to a weakened dollar, partially offset by a decrease in base revenues. During 2008, 50 businesses were acquired worldwide with international businesses representing approximately 39% of the annualized acquired revenues. Base revenues decreased in 2008 versus 2007 due to a 4.8% decline in North American base revenues and flat international base revenues. North American base businesses were adversely affected by steep declines in macro economic trends and related weak industrial production, and a continued decline in the construction and automotive markets. In addition, there was a significant decrease in international industrial production in the fourth quarter of 2008.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income declined 44.6% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the decline in base revenues, the negative effect of currency translation, increased restructuring charges and increased goodwill and intangible    

 16   
 impairment charges. In 2009, the Company recorded impairment charges of $90.0 million and $15.6 million against goodwill and intangibles, respectively. The goodwill and intangible impairments were primarily related to new reporting units which were acquired over the last few years before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired. The higher restructuring charges reflect the Companys efforts to reduce costs in response to weak economic conditions. Improvements in base variable margins and lower overhead costs increased base margins 3.8% in 2009, as the cumulative benefits of restructuring projects began to be realized and selling price versus material cost comparisons were favorable. Total margins declined by 4.6% in 2009 primarily due to the declines in base revenues, restructuring charges and the goodwill and intangible impairment charges.  

 Operating income in 2008 declined 4.8% versus 2007 due to the decline in base revenues and increased restructuring charges, partially offset by the positive effect of currency translation and income from acquisitions. Total margins declined 1.7% primarily due to the declines in base revenues and the lower margins of acquired companies including acquisition-related expenses, which reduced overall margins. Restructuring projects and other cost control measures were implemented in 2008 to better align operating businesses with declining economic conditions, which helped keep overhead expenses favorable to 2007 and partially offset declines in variable margins.  

 TRANSPORTATION  

 Businesses in this segment produce components, fasteners, fluids and polymers, as well as truck remanufacturing and related parts and service.  

 In the Transportation segment, products and services include:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In 2009, this segment primarily served the automotive original equipment manufacturers and tiers (56%) and automotive aftermarket (28%) markets.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 17   
 In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues declined 11.8% in 2009 versus 2008 due to declines in base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Acquisition revenues partially mitigated the base revenue decrease and was primarily related to the purchase of a North American truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business in the third quarter of 2008. Worldwide automotive base revenues declined 19.4% for the full year. North American automotive base revenues declined 24.0% in 2009 due to a decline in car builds of 32%. International automotive base revenues declined 14.6% in 2009 due to a 24% decline in European car builds. The automotive aftermarket businesses, which were less impacted by the economic downturn, declined 7.8%.  

 Revenues increased 6.0% in 2008 over 2007 due to acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation partially offset by an 8.5% decline in base revenues. Acquisition revenue was primarily related to the purchase of a North American truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business and a worldwide components business. Base revenues for the North American automotive businesses declined 15.2% primarily due to a 16% decline in automotive production by the North American automotive manufacturers. The decline in automotive builds was driven by low consumer demand and existing high inventory levels. International base automotive revenues declined 6.3% due to unfavorable customer mix and a 3% decline in European vehicle production. Base revenues for the automotive aftermarket businesses in this segment increased 2.3% mainly due to strong sales of automotive additives from North American businesses to Chinese end markets.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income decreased 44.5% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base revenues described above, the unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher restructuring charges. In addition, a $12.0 million goodwill impairment charge was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 related to the North American truck remanufacturing and related parts and service business. The increase in restructuring charges is primarily due to continued efforts to reduce costs in response to the decline in worldwide automotive production. Total operating margins declined by 4.4% primarily due to the decline in base revenues described above, partially offset by reductions in overhead expenses, favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and benefits of restructuring projects.   

 18   
 Operating income decreased 25.7% in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base revenues described above, lower base margins and higher restructuring charges partially offset by the favorable impact of currency translation. The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to unrecovered raw material price increases and competitive pricing pressure. Base margins declined 3.4% primarily due to the reduction in base revenues, start up costs to support production at foreign-owned manufacturers operating in North America and additional accounts receivable bad debt reserves.  

 INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING  

 Businesses in this segment produce steel, plastic and paper products and equipment used for bundling, shipping and protecting goods in transit.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues decreased 27.6% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable impact of currency translation. Base revenues declined 34.6% for the North American strapping businesses largely due to declines in consumable and equipment volume in key end markets such as primary metals,    

 19   
 construction and general industrial. The international strapping businesses declined 25.4% which were adversely affected by the continued global decline in the industrial production and construction end markets. Worldwide stretch and protective packaging declined 20.0% and 4.7%, respectively.  

 Revenues increased 8.5% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to revenues from acquired companies and the favorable effect of currency translation. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of a European industrial packaging business, a European stretch packaging business, a U.S. protective packaging business and a U.S. equipment business. Total base revenues were virtually flat as a 1.2% and 30.9% increase related to international strapping and worldwide insulation systems, respectively, were offset by a 6.0% and 2.7% decrease related to North American strapping and worldwide protective packaging, respectively. These businesses were especially affected by weakness in the North American primary metals and construction end markets.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income decreased 68.4% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base revenues described above, the negative effect of currency translation and higher restructuring charges. Base margins declined 4.6% primarily due to the decline in base revenues discussed above, partially offset by favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and reduced overhead costs as the benefits of restructuring projects began to be realized.  

 Operating income declined 6.7% in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to a decrease in base variable margins and increased restructuring charges partially offset by income from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. The decrease in base variable margins is primarily due to unfavorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and unfavorable product mix.  

 FOOD EQUIPMENT  

 Businesses in this segment produce commercial food equipment and related service.  

 In the Food Equipment segment, products and services include:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 20   
 In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues decreased 12.8% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the decline in base business and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. The acquired revenues were attributable to the acquisition of a European food equipment business. North American food equipment base revenues declined 11.2% while international food equipment base revenues declined 7.9% in 2009 as a result of weak demand across all worldwide markets. Base revenues for the North American institutional/restaurant businesses declined 14.7% as customers delayed equipment purchases. Base service revenues declined a moderate 1.2% as customers continued to maintain existing equipment.  

 Revenues increased 10.5% in 2008 over 2007 due to revenues from acquisitions, the favorable effect of currency translation and base revenue growth. The acquired revenues were primarily attributable to the acquisition of two food processing businesses and two European food equipment businesses. Internationally, base revenues increased 3.2% primarily due to strong institutional and service revenue growth in Asia-Pacific and Europe. North American base revenues were flat over 2007 as increased service revenues and retail sales were offset by lower demand for equipment in areas such as casual dining restaurants, hotels and airports.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income declined 20.5% in 2009 versus 2008 due to the decrease in base revenues described above and the unfavorable effect of currency translation and restructuring charges. Base margins decreased 0.4% primarily due to the decline in base revenues, partially offset by margin gains from favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons, benefits from restructuring projects and favorable product mix.  

 Operating income increased 5.8% in 2008 over 2007 due to the positive effect of leverage from the revenue increase described above, the favorable effect of currency translation and income from acquisitions, partially offset by higher restructuring charges. Operating margins decreased 0.7% due to lower margins of acquired businesses and higher restructuring charges partially offset by margin gains from growth in base revenues.  

 POWER SYSTEMS & ELECTRONICS

 The results of operations for the Power Systems & Electronics segment for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues declined 31.5% in 2009 versus 2008 mainly due to declines in base revenues and the negative effect of currency translation. Revenues fell as end market demand continued to decline across the broad spectrum of industries that this segment serves, including key end markets such as commercial construction and general industrial. The revenue decrease was partially offset by 2008 acquisitions, including a welding equipment business and a PC board fabrication business. Worldwide base welding revenues declined 32.7% in 2009. North American welding base businesses declined 36.3% while international welding base businesses declined 23.5%. Base revenues for the electronics businesses fell 30.0% while base revenues in the PC board fabrication businesses fell 44.7%, both largely due to the decline in consumer demand for electronics during 2009.   

 22   
 Revenues increased 5.0% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Acquisitions included a worldwide PC board fabrication business and a welding accessories business. Overall base revenues grew a modest 0.2% mainly due to a 19.7% growth in international welding base businesses driven by strong demand in the energy, heavy fabrications and ship building end markets. North American welding base business declined 3.6% primarily due to weak North American industrial production and falling end market demand in key areas such as fabrication, construction, automotive and general industrial. Base revenues for the ground support businesses grew 4.4% related to higher worldwide demand for both military and commercial airport products. Base revenues for the PC board fabrication and electronics related businesses declined 9.4% and 2.4%, respectively, due to lower worldwide market demand, especially in consumer electronics.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income decreased 53.3% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the declines in base revenues described above, 2009 impairment charges, higher restructuring charges and the negative effect of currency translation. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $18.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively, were incurred in the PC board fabrication and welding accessories businesses in the first quarter of 2009. Base margins decreased 2.7% primarily due to the declines in base revenues, partially offset by favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons, benefits of restructuring projects and lower overhead costs.  

 Operating income increased 2.8% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to lower operating expenses and reduced overhead spending within the PC board fabrication businesses as a result of 2007 and 2008 restructuring projects, and the favorable effect of currency translation. Total operating margins decreased 0.4% primarily due to lower margins from acquisitions after acquisition-related expenses.  

 CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS  

 Businesses in this segment produce tools, fasteners and other products for construction applications.  

 In the Construction Products segment, products include:  

       fasteners and related fastening tools for wood and metal applications;

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 23   
 In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues declined 23.2% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily as a result of the decline in base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues for the North American, European and Asia-Pacific regions decreased 26.7%, 22.9% and 1.1%, respectively, primarily due to ongoing weakness in the residential and commercial construction markets in North America and Europe. U.S. housing starts declined 14% on an annualized basis in 2009. In addition, U.S. commercial construction square footage activity fell 46% for the year versus 2008. The Asia-Pacific region outperformed other regions largely due to better customer activity in Australia and New Zealand.  

 Revenues declined 3.6% in 2008 versus 2007 largely as a result of a 7.3% decline in base business partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation. Base revenues for the North American and European businesses declined 14.6% and 7.0%, respectively, in 2008 while revenues for the Asia-Pacific region increased 4.4% on strong first half 2008 market demand and new product introductions. This decline in base revenues was a result of weakness in the residential and commercial construction markets in North America and Europe as indicated by a 31% and 19% decline in U.S. housing starts and commercial construction square footage activity, respectively, in 2008. European construction activity slowed substantially in the fourth quarter of 2008.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income decreased 60.0% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the base revenue decline described above. In addition, the unfavorable effect of currency translation and higher restructuring charges contributed to the lower income and margins. Base margins declined 4.3% as reduced operating expenses, including favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and benefits from restructuring projects were more than offset by the effect of lower base revenues.  

 Operating income and margins decreased 15.3% and 1.7%, respectively, in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to the revenue decline described above partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation, lower restructuring charges and lower operating costs resulting from prior year restructuring projects and tight cost controls.   

 24   
 POLYMERS & FLUIDS  

 Businesses in this segment produce adhesives, sealants, lubrication and cutting fluids and hygiene products.  

 In the Polymers & Fluids segment, products include:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 The results of operations for the Polymers & Fluids segment for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues decreased 7.5% in 2009 versus 2008 due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation partially offset by revenues from acquisitions. Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of a pressure sensitive adhesives business and two construction adhesives businesses in 2008. Total base revenues declined 12.4% primarily due to continued weakness in worldwide industrial production and construction end markets. Worldwide base revenues for the fluids businesses declined 10.1% while base revenues for the polymers businesses declined 15.0% in 2009.  

 Revenues increased 32.3% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to revenues from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Acquisition revenue was primarily the result of the purchase of two pressure    

 25   
 sensitive adhesives businesses, an international fluid products business, two polymers businesses, two North American construction adhesives businesses and a South American sealant business. Total base revenues were essentially flat as a 2.2% increase in worldwide polymers revenues was offset by a 3.6% decline in worldwide fluids revenues. Strong growth in North American polymers and industrial adhesives businesses, as well as increased demand in Brazil, India and China, was offset by substantially weaker demand for fluid products in North American and European industrial based end markets.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income decreased 60.9% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base revenues and a $60.0 million goodwill impairment charge against the pressure sensitive adhesives business in the first quarter of 2009. Base margins decreased 0.2% as favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and the benefits of restructuring projects were more than offset by the effect of lower base revenues. The first quarter 2009 goodwill impairment charge reduced margins by 5.5%. Additionally, acquisitions diluted margins 1.2% for the year.  

 Operating income increased 13.4% in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to income from acquisitions and the favorable effect of currency translation. Total operating margins declined 2.4% primarily due to the dilutive effect of the lower margins of acquired businesses. Variable margins decreased slightly due to higher material costs and unfavorable product mix, offset by overhead cost reductions.  

 DECORATIVE SURFACES

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 26   
 In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues decreased 18.9% in 2009 versus 2008 due to lower base revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. North American laminate base revenues declined 18.9% as a result of the continued downturn in North American commercial and residential construction. These declines were partially offset by product penetration in the premium high-definition laminate product market. International base revenues declined 9.7% due to European volume declines.  

 Revenues declined 0.7% in 2008 versus 2007 due to the decline in base revenues partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation. North American laminate revenues decreased 3.4% as a result of laminate volume drop off in the second half of 2008 partially offset by a customer shift to higher priced premium products. Flooring revenues decreased 28.3% on steep volume declines. International laminate revenues decreased 2.0% over the prior year as new product introductions partially offset lower volumes.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income decreased 20.2% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base revenues, increased restructuring charges and the unfavorable effect of currency translation. Base margins increased 0.4% primarily due to favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons, benefits from restructuring projects and higher margins on the high-definition laminate product, partially offset by the effect of lower base revenues.  

 Operating income decreased 11.4% in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decline in base revenues described above. Lower selling expenses in 2008 versus 2007 were more than offset by significant raw material increases which contributed to an overall reduction in variable margins. Base margins declined 1.2% due to both the revenue decline and cost increases.  

 ALL OTHER  

 This segment includes all other operating segments.  

 In the All Other segment, products include:  

       equipment and related software for testing and measuring of materials and structures;

 The results of operations for the All Other segment for 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In 2009 and 2008, the changes in revenues, operating income and operating margins over the prior year were primarily due to the following factors:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Operating Revenues  

 Revenues decreased 13.6% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base business revenues and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by an increase in revenues from acquired companies. The acquisition revenue was primarily related to the purchase of two test and measurement businesses in 2008. Base revenues declined 15.7%, 12.1%, 19.6% and 32.0%, for the test and measurement, consumer packaging, industrial plastics and metals and finishing businesses, respectively, due to negative industrial production trends and the related impact of weak end market and capital equipment demand across the broad spectrum of industries this segment serves.   

 28   
 Revenues increased 4.0% in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to revenues from acquired companies and the favorable effect of currency translation partially offset by a decline in base revenues. The increase in acquisition revenue was primarily due to the purchase of three test and measurement businesses and a label business. Base revenues declined 7.8%, 3.2% and 3.0% for the industrial plastics and metals, consumer packaging and finishing businesses, respectively, due to a notable decrease in end market demand in the second half of the year. These decreases were partially offset by an 8.0% base business increase in test and measurement due to strong sales of equipment used in the materials and structural testing markets, particularly in Asia.  

 Operating Income  

 Operating income declined 34.0% in 2009 versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in base revenues described above, higher restructuring charges and the unfavorable effect of currency translation, partially offset by increased income from acquisitions. Base margins decreased 1.9% as favorable selling price versus material cost comparisons and benefits from restructuring projects were more than offset by the effect of lower base revenues. Additionally, acquisitions diluted total margins by 0.8%.  

 Operating income was essentially flat in 2008 over 2007 primarily due to the negative leverage effect of the decrease in revenues described above, partially offset by the favorable effect of currency translation and income from acquired companies. Total operating margins declined 0.7% primarily due to lower margins for both base business and acquired businesses. Base operating margins decreased 0.2% as the gains from tight cost controls and the benefits of prior year restructuring projects were offset by the impact of lower revenues.  

 AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

 Amortization expense increased to $203.2 million in 2009 and $184.4 million in 2008, versus $145.7 million in 2007, due to intangible amortization related to newly acquired businesses.  

 IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

 Total goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges by segment for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets increased to $105.6 million in 2009 versus $1.6 million in 2008, primarily due to goodwill impairment charges related to the pressure sensitive adhesives reporting unit of $60.0 million, the PC board fabrication reporting unit of $18.0 million and the truck remanufacturing and related parts and service reporting unit of $12.0 million. Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets was $1.6 million in 2008 versus $2.2 million in 2007. See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further details of the impairment charges.

 INTEREST EXPENSE  

 Interest expense increased to $164.8 million in 2009 versus $154.5 million in 2008 primarily due to interest on the 6.25% and 5.15% notes which were issued in March 2009, partially offset by lower interest related to the 5.75% notes and 6.875% notes repaid at maturity in March 2009 and November 2008, respectively, and lower commercial paper rates and borrowings. Interest expense increased to $154.5 million in 2008 versus $102.1 million in 2007 primarily as a result of interest expense on the 5.25% Euro notes issued in October 2007 and higher average borrowings of short-term commercial paper, partially offset by lower market rates in 2008. The weighted-average interest rate on commercial paper was 0.3% in 2009, 2.4% in 2008 and 5.2% in 2007.  

 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  

 Other income (expense) was expense of $7.4 million in 2009 versus income of $4.7 million in 2008. The decrease was primarily due to 2009 losses on foreign currency transactions of $24.9 million, lower income from investments of $4.9 million (versus $17.0 million in 2008) and lower interest income of $17.6 million (versus $29.4 million in 2008), partially offset by the impact of the German transfer tax charge of $44.0 million in 2008.  

 Other income decreased to $4.7 million in 2008 from $58.3 million in 2007, primarily due to a German transfer tax charge of $44.0 million in 2008. Additionally, income from a venture capital limited partnership was $0.2 million in 2008 versus income of $25.3 million in 2007 related to mark-to-market adjustments; and the Company incurred a charge of $18.8 million related to the timing of tax deductions of leveraged leases in 2008. This was partially offset by higher income of $10.7 million related to a mortgage-backed security and a $9.4 million increase in interest income.  

 INCOME TAXES  

 The effective tax rate was 20.1% in 2009, 28.1% in 2008 and 29.3% in 2007. The effective tax rate for 2009 was favorably impacted by discrete tax adjustments in the fourth quarter of $85.5 million related to a global legal structure reorganization and $77.5 million related to a favorable settlement reached with the German tax authorities. In the above mentioned reorganization, the Company reorganized its ownership structure in certain U.S. and foreign subsidiaries in the fourth quarter of 2009 and made an election regarding the U.S. tax treatment of a foreign subsidiary. The Company recorded a reduction in tax expense primarily for the effect of the resulting foreign tax credits. Also during the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company finalized a settlement with the German tax authorities primarily regarding the treatment of an intercompany financing transaction which resulted in the reversal of previously established tax reserves as a reduction of tax expense.  

 See the Income Taxes note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory rate to the effective tax rate.  

 INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  

 Income from continuing operations in 2009 of $969.5 million ($1.93 per diluted share) was 42.7% lower than 2008 income of $1.7 billion ($3.24 per diluted share). Income from continuing operations in 2008 was 7.5% lower than 2007 income of $1.8 billion ($3.29 per diluted share).  

 FOREIGN CURRENCY  

 The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies decreased operating revenues by approximately $653 million in 2009 and decreased income from continuing operations by approximately 10 cents per diluted share. The weakening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies increased operating revenues by approximately $425 million in 2008 and increased income from continuing operations by approximately 8 cents per diluted share.  

 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  

 Loss from discontinued operations was $22.5 million in 2009 versus $172.1 million in 2008, primarily due to 2008 impairment on goodwill of $132.6 million, loss reserve on assets held for sale of $64.0 million partially offset by gains on sales of discontinued operations in 2008 versus losses in 2009. The results from discontinued    

 30   
 operations was a loss of $172.1 million in 2008 versus income of $42.2 million in 2007. See the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further information.  

 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

 In October 2009, new accounting guidance was issued on multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. The new accounting guidance amends the accounting for multiple-deliverable arrangements to enable the vendor to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit. The guidance establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable, which is based on: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence, (2) third-party evidence or (3) estimates. The Company will adopt the new accounting guidance on January 1, 2011 and does not anticipate the change will materially affect the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

 The Companys primary sources of liquidity are free operating cash flows and short-term credit facilities. Management continues to believe that internally generated cash flows will be adequate to service debt, continue to pay dividends, to finance internal growth and to fund small to medium-sized acquisitions.  

 The primary uses of liquidity are:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Cash Flow  

 The Company uses free operating cash flow to measure cash flow generated by operations that is available for dividends, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayment. Free operating cash flow is a measurement that is not the same as net cash flow from operating activities per the statement of cash flows and may not be consistent with similarly titled measures used by other companies.  

 Summarized cash flow information for the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 On August 20, 2007, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which provides for the buyback of up to $3.0 billion of the Companys common stock over an open-ended period    

 31   
 of time. Through December 31, 2009, the Company repurchased 39.8 million shares of its common stock under this program at an average price of $44.72 per share. There are approximately $1.2 billion of authorized repurchases remaining under this program.  

 On August 4, 2006, the Companys Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program which provided for the buyback of up to 35.0 million shares. This stock repurchase program was completed in November 2007.  

 Return on Average Invested Capital  

 The Company uses return on average invested capital (ROIC) to measure the effectiveness of its operations use of invested capital to generate profits. We believe that ROIC is a meaningful metric to investors and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate ROIC. ROIC for the three years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The 530 basis point decrease in ROIC in 2009 versus 2008 was the result of after-tax operating income decreasing 38.5%, resulting from the economic downturn, while average invested capital decreased 7.5%.  

 The 200 basis point decrease in ROIC in 2008 versus 2007 was the result of average invested capital increasing 8.8%, primarily due to acquisitions, while after-tax operating income decreased 3.2%, primarily due to a decrease in base business operating income.   

 32   
 Working Capital  

 Net working capital at December 31, 2009 and 2008 is summarized as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Net working capital increased primarily due to the pay down of commercial paper and repayment of the 5.75% notes.  

 Debt  

 Total debt at December 31, 2009 and 2008 was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Company issues commercial paper to fund general corporate needs and to fund small and medium-sized acquisitions. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had approximately $135.5 million outstanding under its commercial paper program. The Company also has committed lines of credit of $2.5 billion in the U.S. to support the issuances of commercial paper. Of this amount, $2.0 billion is provided under a line of credit agreement with a termination date of June 11, 2010 and the remaining $500.0 million is under a revolving credit facility that terminates on June 15, 2012. No amounts are outstanding under these two facilities. The Companys foreign operations also have unused capacity on uncommitted facilities of approximately $370 million.  

 The Company had $500.0 million of 5.75% redeemable notes due March 1, 2009, which were outstanding at December 31, 2008, that were repaid at maturity.  

 In 2009, the Company issued $800.0 million of 5.15% redeemable notes due April 1, 2014 at 99.92% of face value and $700.0 million of 6.25% redeemable notes due April 1, 2019 at 99.98% of face value. The net proceeds from the offering were used to pay down the Companys commercial paper balance.   

 33   
 The Company believes that based on its current free operating cash flow, debt-to-capitalization ratios and credit ratings, it could readily obtain additional financing if necessary. The Companys targeted debt-to-capital ratio is 20% to 30%, excluding the impact of any larger acquisitions.  

 Stockholders Equity  

 The changes to stockholders equity during 2009 and 2008 were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

 The Companys significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Company has recorded current income taxes payable of $417.3 million and non-current tax liabilities of $198.0 million including liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. The Company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of payments related to the non-current tax obligations.  

 The Company has provided guarantees related to the debt of certain unconsolidated affiliates of $24.0 million at December 31, 2009. In the event one of these affiliates defaults on its debt, the Company would be liable for the debt repayment. The Company has recorded liabilities related to these guarantees of $17.0 million at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2009, the Company had open stand-by letters of credit of $173.0 million, substantially all of which expire in 2010. The Company had no other significant off-balance sheet commitments at December 31, 2009.  

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

 The Company has six accounting policies which it believes are most important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and which require the Company to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.   

 34   
 These critical accounting policies are as follows:  

 Realizability of Inventories  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Generally, the Companys businesses perform an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value based on the following usage criteria:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 In addition, for approximately half of the U.S. operations, the Company has elected to use the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of inventory costing. Generally, this method results in a lower inventory value than the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method due to the effects of inflation.  

 Collectibility of Accounts Receivable  The Company estimates the allowance for uncollectible accounts based on the greater of a specific reserve or a reserve calculated based on the historical write-off percentage over the last two years. In addition, the allowance for uncollectible accounts includes reserves for customer credits and cash discounts, which are also estimated based on past experience.  

 Depreciation of Plant and Equipment  The Companys U.S. businesses compute depreciation on an accelerated basis, as follows:  

   Buildings and improvements      150% declining balance   

   Machinery and equipment      200% declining balance    

 The majority of the international businesses compute depreciation on a straight-line basis to conform to their local statutory accounting and tax regulations.  

 Income Taxes  The Company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The Companys deferred and other tax balances are based on managements interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous taxing jurisdictions. Income tax expense and liabilities recognized by the Company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income and effect of the Companys various tax planning strategies. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company.  

 Goodwill and Intangible Assets  The Companys business acquisitions typically result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of amortization expense and possibly impairment expense that the Company will incur in future periods. The Company follows the guidance prescribed in the accounting standards to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. On an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events occur, the Company compares the estimated fair value of its 60 reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if a goodwill impairment exists. If the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss, if any, is recorded for the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill. In calculating the fair value of the reporting units, management relies on a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable transactions and other market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and managements judgment in applying them in the impairment tests of goodwill and other intangible assets.  

 In the third quarter of 2009, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill impairment assessment from the first quarter to the third quarter. This constitutes a change in method of applying an accounting principle that the Company believes is preferable. The change was made to better align the timing of the    

 35   
 Companys goodwill impairment assessment with the Companys annual business planning and forecasting process.  

 As of December 31, 2009, the Company had goodwill and intangible assets of $6.6 billion allocated to its 60 reporting units. The Companys risk of significant impairment charges is mitigated by the number of diversified businesses and end markets represented by its 60 reporting units. In addition, the individual businesses in most of its reporting units have been acquired over a long period of time, and therefore have been able to improve their performance, primarily as a result of the application of the Companys 80/20 business simplification process. The amount of goodwill and intangibles allocated to individual reporting units range from approximately $5 million to $700 million, with the average amount equal to $110 million.  

 Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges related to continuing operations were $105.6 million in 2009, $1.6 million in 2008 and $2.2 million in 2007. The impairment charges during 2009 were primarily related to new reporting units which were acquired over the last few years before the recent economic downturn. These charges were driven primarily by lower current forecasts compared to the expected forecasts at the time the reporting units were acquired. See the Goodwill and Intangible Assets note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of the relative carrying values and fair values of the reporting units related to these impairment charges.  

 Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in the factors described above. Due to the inherent uncertainties associated with these factors and economic conditions in the Companys global end markets, impairment charges related to one or more reporting units could occur in future periods.  

 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  The Company has various company-sponsored defined benefit retirement plans covering a substantial portion of U.S. employees and many employees outside the United States. Pension and other postretirement expense and obligations are determined based on actuarial valuations. Pension benefit obligations are generally based on each participants years of service, future compensation, and age at retirement or termination. Important assumptions in determining pension and postretirement expense and obligations are the discount rate, the expected long-term return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.  

 The Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could theoretically be effectively settled at the end of the year. In estimating this rate, the Company looks at rates of return on high-quality fixed income investments, with similar duration to the liabilities in the plan. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the present value of the U.S. primary pension plan obligation by approximately $30 million.  

 The expected long-term return on plan assets is based on historical and expected long-term returns for similar investment allocations among asset classes. For the U.S. primary pension plan, the Companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.5% for 2009 and will be 8.0% for 2010. A 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the annual pension expense by approximately $3 million. See the Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for information on how this rate is determined.
