Infrared Technology Overview  

Infrared is a portion of the electro-magnetic spectrum that is adjacent to the visible spectrum, but is invisible to the human eye due to its longer wavelengths. Unlike visible light, infrared radiation (or heat) is emitted directly by all objects above absolute zero in temperature. Thermal imaging systems detect this infrared radiation and convert it into an electronic signal, which is then processed into a video signal and displayed on a video screen. Thermal imaging systems are different than other types of low light vision systems, such as visible light intensification used in green or gray sighted night vision goggles. Infrared imaging systems are not adversely affected by the presence of visible light, so they can be used day or night, and they are not susceptible to rapid changes in visible light levels. Since infrared systems are detecting emitted infrared radiation, they are passive and thus more covert than certain active or illuminated systems. Additionally, thermal imaging systems can measure very small temperature differences, a critical feature for a variety of commercial, industrial, and scientific applications.  

An infrared detector, which collects or absorbs infrared radiation and converts it into an electronic signal, is a sensor assembly that is the primary component of thermal imaging systems. The two types of infrared detectors we manufacture and use in our systems are often referred to as cooled and uncooled. Cooled detectors utilize a mechanical micro-cooler to reduce the operating temperature of the infrared sensor to -200° C, and offer high sensitivity and resolution for long-range applications or those requiring high measurement precision. These systems, while more sensitive and thus able to see farther, result in a product that is more expensive, heavier, more complex, and uses more power than those using uncooled detectors. Uncooled detectors operate at room temperature and thus do not require a micro-cooler, resulting in products that are lighter, use less power and are less expensive to produce than cooled systems. While the performance of uncooled detectors is improving, uncooled detectors are still less sensitive than cooled detectors. The cost of both types of detectors is declining and we expect to continue reducing costs as volumes rise and the technology advances in the future. We currently expect demand for both types of systems to increase.  

Recent Acquisitions  

Since 2003, we have made a total of thirteen acquisitions. Most recently, we acquired Raymarine Holdings, Ltd. (Raymarine) in May 2010 and ICx Technologies, Inc. (ICx) in October 2010. The Raymarine acquisition significantly enhanced the distribution capabilities of our thermal marine products business by adding approximately 1,000 dealer outlets and 400 marine OEM relationships. Additionally, Raymarine provided us the opportunity to build an integrated product line that offers thermal imaging cameras coupled with Raymarines multifunction displays, radars, depth sounders, global positioning systems, and autopilots products to create the broadest, most effective, and easiest to use suite of products in the marine electronics industry. The acquisition of ICx expanded our capabilities into advanced sensor technologies that detect CBRNE threats, including products that are currently sold to the defense and homeland security markets. ICx also enhanced our existing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance product suite by adding advanced radars, imaging, and integrated platforms solutions. Both businesses are reported as individual business segments in 2010.  

We are selective and opportunistic in our acquisitions, seeking to purchase companies that are strategically significant and additive or adjacent to our existing technologies, distribution network, or product portfolio. We are continuously evaluating opportunities for additional acquisitions, but cannot predict the timing, size, or nature of any future activity.  

In February 2011, we announced an organizational change that will impact our Government Systems division and will result in three operating and reporting segments. The new Surveillance segment comprises our former Government Systems segment and ICxs imaging and radars operations and focuses on developing, manufacturing, and marketing thermal imaging and wide-area surveillance systems. The Detection segment has been created to focus on the CBRNE products and markets that we added with our ICx acquisition. The Integrated Systems segment will focus on large programmatic and multi-function solutions for diverse tactical

Since 2001, our revenue, earnings per share, and operating cash flow have grown at annual rates of 23%, 25%, and 28%, respectively. In any deployment of our cash flow, we analyze the long-term profitability impact on our business and choose only those initiatives that have a positive cost-adjusted payoff based on conservative assumptions.  

Business Segments  

Thermography  

The Thermography market has traditionally addressed thermal imaging applications where both imaging and temperature measurement are required. This market has grown in size and breadth as prices have declined, volumes have increased, and new applications have emerged. Our strategies in this business are to continue to  

7  

Table of Contents 

 develop products for high-end applications while introducing new products at lower price points, and to capitalize on highly price-elastic demand in numerous emerging markets. Over the past several years, markets have grown rapidly and expanded beyond the traditional industrial predictive and preventive maintenance segments. We expect new markets to continue to develop in the future.  

Markets  

Predictive Maintenance   Thermal imaging systems are used for monitoring the condition of mechanical and electrical equipment. Such monitoring assists our customers in identifying equipment faults (manifested as hot spots) so they can be repaired before they fail. This increases equipment productivity and avoids catastrophic failures or major damage, which reduces operating expenses by lowering repair costs and reducing downtime. Improved functionality of image analysis software, smaller size and weight, and simplicity of system operation are critical factors for this well established market segment.  

Research & Development   Infrareds unique ability to detect very small differences in temperature while detailing complex thermal dynamics and patterns makes Thermography systems a useful tool in a wide variety of research and development applications. Our systems provide the ability to view thermal distribution in real time for products ranging in size from small hybrid integrated circuits to jet engines. Common applications include product development of microelectronics, cell phones, laptop computers, telecommunications equipment, consumer appliances, automotive components, and aircraft engines. Systems used in research and development applications typically require very high imaging performance and measurement precision, coupled with extensive analysis and reporting software. We have a complete line of both cooled and uncooled infrared imagers specifically designed for high-end research and development applications.  

Manufacturing Process Control   Thermal imaging applications for manufacturing process control include applications where temperature consistency is critical, including monitoring the quality of metal, plastic and glass cast parts, which are highly dependent upon the temperature distribution in the mold; monitoring the quality of paper, which is dependent upon proper and even moisture distribution during the drying process; and monitoring the quality of products such as rubber gloves, which can be thermally examined to locate abnormally warm or cool spots, indicating non-uniform thickness that may result in a quality defect.  

Building Inspection   Infrared imagers can detect missing insulation, electrical faults, water intrusion and pest infiltration, gauge energy efficiency, and help detect the presence of moisture. Market segments include building diagnostics, energy auditing and home inspection, property and facility management, HVAC and plumbing, and moisture detection and restoration. This market has grown rapidly as costs have declined and new uses for thermal imaging systems have emerged. Building inspection represented one of the largest single Thermography markets for us in 2010.

Table of Contents 

Gas Detection   Specially designed infrared systems can detect and image hydrocarbon gas emissions or leaks. Using this technology, we have established a market focused on leak detection at gas production, transmission and storage locations, as well as compliance monitoring by environmental and other regulatory agencies. New applications are emerging for this technology. For example, we now have a system that detects sulfur hexafluoride, a dangerous pollutant and potential fire hazard used as an insulator in electrical transformers. During 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a requirement that large-scale extractors and distributors of greenhouse gases begin to annually self-report the amount of greenhouse gas that is emitted from their facilities. The issuance noted that the EPA will allow, and in certain situations require, the use of optical gas imaging systems such as ours to be used to perform the emission analysis.  

Emerging Markets   Over the past seven years, we have successfully introduced progressively lower priced thermal imaging systems that have enabled us to expand traditional Thermography markets and open new markets for our products. These products, the latest of which is the i-family, have met with strong market acceptance in the higher volume building and electrical inspection markets, and we expect additional market segments for thermal imaging to develop as prices continue to decline. These market segments may include healthcare and screening, food service and distribution, veterinary science, automotive care, aircraft inspection, and maritime vessel inspections.  

Training   We offer fee-based training on the principles of thermography and the use of our products through ITC®, our Infrared Training Center, which provides comprehensive instruction, training, certification and applications engineering from several FLIR locations or at the customers site. We also license Infrared Training Centers to qualified third parties in certain countries. In 2010, over 10,000 people received training at our Infrared Training Centers worldwide.  

Sales and Distribution  

We sell our Thermography products worldwide through a direct sales staff and a network of distributors and representatives. Our Thermography business continues to expand distribution, particularly in Asia and Latin America. At the end of 2010, our Thermography segment employed over 130 direct sales personnel and utilized approximately 750 distributors. In 2007, we acquired Extech Instruments Corporation, a distributor of hand-held test and measurement equipment. We have utilized its distribution channels, particularly into catalogs and retailers, to expand our distribution in the United States. In January 2008, we acquired Cedip Infrared Systems which has provided additional distribution capability, particularly in international markets.  

Thermography order backlog, defined as orders received for products or services for which a sales agreement is in place and delivery is expected within twelve months, was $22 million as of December 31, 2010, compared with $27 million at the end of 2009. Thermography is among our least backlog intensive segment, as shipment of product typically occurs within a few weeks of receipt of orders.

Commercial Vision Systems serves customers such as OEMs, automotive suppliers, aircraft manufacturers and dealers, marine electronics dealers, major integrators of security systems, and increasingly, consumers. Although we have hundreds of customers for our CVS products, there remains tremendous opportunity to expand this business. The emerging personal vision systems market is becoming increasingly accessible as we leverage our business model to reduce the price of advanced thermal imaging products. This consumer market is a key strategic area of focus given the vast size of the customer base and the opportunities it provides us to expand our volumes and brand name. Our established distribution network, broad product portfolio, and product and technical development capabilities set a foundation for future success as we continue to leverage our commercial operating model to reduce our costs in creating advanced imaging products. As we continue to make our products accessible to a larger population of end-users and build awareness of the advantages of thermal imaging applications, we anticipate our CVS segment will provide significant revenue and profitability for our business.  

Competition  

The markets that CVS addresses are emerging from the early-adopter environments to broader based demand, which has attracted competitors. We believe the key drivers of success in these markets are: technological proficiency in imaging sensors, product design and functionality, product cost, ability to deliver in a timely manner, distribution reach, brand name, and scalability of operations. We are uniquely positioned to operate in this competitive environment given our demonstrated ability to innovate high-quality sensors at low cost due to our operating model, our advanced research and development capabilities, our established and reliable distribution network, our diversified manufacturing operations, and our broad product offering. The primary competitors vary market by market, but include divisions of General Dynamics (Axsys), L-3 Communications, Sofradir (ULIS), Axis and numerous smaller companies.

Table of Contents 

 investments in software and networking solutions. We have invested significant resources in evolving Raymarines product line, consolidating its distribution network, and rationalizing its operations and outsourced manufacturing relationships. While the boating market that Raymarine serves is sizable, the industry has been in a cyclical trough. We believe that recent operational improvements have positioned the business to benefit significantly as global demand returns to historical levels.  

Markets  

Recreational Boating OEMs   A main focus of Raymarine has been to establish relationships with boat manufacturers in order to sell a fully integrated electronic backbone on new boats, with the intention of driving brand continuity with a large installed base of end-users. Medium sized (26 to 45 feet in length) and large boats (in excess of 45 feet in length) have a unique need for sophisticated electronics and multifunction control solutions. Additionally, in recent years, demand has grown for scaled-down instruments in the much larger segment for small boats (comprising inflatable and rigid motor craft below 25 feet in length). Raymarines comprehensive product offering has evolved to serve these evolving boat manufacturers needs well.  

Aftermarket   Due to the comparatively long life of a recreational boat, the growing importance and usefulness of marine electronic equipment and the pace of technological development, the aftermarket is large for electronics systems refits and upgrades. Raymarine has ensured that both its instruments and its networking software are capable of integrating with third party platforms and instruments, which has become a key driver of demand in the aftermarket.  

Sales and Distribution  

Raymarines products are sold through a combination of direct sales, captive and third-party distributors, service partners, and retail outlets. Raymarine has strong relationships with a large number of key boat builder OEMs, most of which are supplied directly with the latest Raymarine systems. Many of these relationships are long-term in nature and have evolved over a number of years with important exchanges of product development ideas. Raymarines OEM customers have typically built up important embedded technical product fitting and integration knowledge over a period of time. They have also established confidence in the critical electronic systems fitted to the products they supply to their customers. In addition to supplying OEMs directly, a number are supplied through Raymarines distribution network.  

Raymarine also supplies a global network of approximately 2,400 wholesalers, national distributors (both owned and third party), and retailers. Many of these partnerships are on an exclusive basis, whereby Raymarine is the only electronic boating equipment stocked. Raymarine also has a global network of approximately 2,000 dealers and service centers which are able to sell, repair, and install Raymarines products. This global support and repair service network is a key competitive advantage as many of our products are critical to the operation of a boat. Additionally, the business has established a presence at retail locations and boat shows, which serves to build the Raymarine brand in both the new-build and aftermarket spaces. Having a strong consumer brand name and a large installed base of users created through our first fitments drives business in the aftermarket as boaters look to upgrade or replace instrumentation, often with the brand with which they are familiar.  

Raymarine backlog as of December 31, 2010, was $11 million. Similar to our Thermography business, Raymarine is not considered a backlog intensive business, as shipment of product typically occurs within a few weeks of receipt of orders.

Customers  

Raymarine sells its products via diverse distribution channels to a wide variety of customers. Raymarine has established long-term relationships with approximately 250 OEM boat builders, each of which have experience and knowledge of the product capabilities, quality, and reliability. These OEMs value the breadth of the Raymarine product line and our global dealership service network. We supply a number of OEMs directly, who outfit their new boats with integrated Raymarine electronic systems. As a result of Raymarines long standing relationships with OEMs and its ability to provide fully integrated electronic systems, including an electronic backbone to a boat, there is a high level of business from consumers purchasing replacement or upgrade equipment for their outfitted boats. We also sell discrete instruments to consumers who are looking to install new or upgrade existing marine electronics on their small, medium, or large boats.  

Competition  

The maritime electronics markets are competitive with many established brands and companies. We compete with these companies through innovation, product capabilities and perceived value, relationships with OEMs and distributors, and product availability and service. We believe we compete successfully with our strength in distribution, established brand name, engineering capabilities, and renewed financial flexibility. Our principal competitors in the recreational boating market include Furuno, Garmin, Navico, and a number of small companies.  

Government Systems  

Government Systems focuses on providing enhanced vision capabilities to a wide variety of military, paramilitary, law enforcement, public safety, and other government customers. Our systems typically provide the capability to see over long distances, day or night, through adverse weather conditions, and from a wide variety of vehicle, man portable, and fixed installation platforms. Currently, the majority of our Government Systems infrared imaging systems use cooled technology to identify objects from long distances; however, uncooled thermal imaging systems are growing rapidly in certain markets such as weapon sights, hand-held monoculars/binoculars, military vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. Many of our customers require systems that operate in demanding environments such as extreme climatic conditions, battlefield and military environments, or maritime conditions. Systems are often installed onto larger platforms and must be able to integrate with such other systems as aircraft avionics, radars, laser systems, and large, broad-based security networks.  

Government Systems offers a very wide array of products across multiple applications. For airborne applications, we have developed highly stabilized platforms, known as gimbals, which typically contain multiple payloads in addition to the infrared imaging system, as well as sophisticated software and analytic capabilities. For land applications, we manufacture three types of products: hand-held products, platform mounted products, and targeting products. Platform mounted units are typically housed in a weather-tight enclosure and feature remote control capabilities and multi-sensor integration capability (e.g., closed circuit TV, laser rangefinder, compass or global positioning system). Hand-held ground products are ruggedized and have optional lenses and target location capabilities. Ground-based targeting products are designed to attach to existing daylight sights to provide bore-sighted, nighttime capabilities. For maritime applications, we manufacture shipborne products which are similar to our airborne gimbals, but are inverted and customized for the marine environment.  

We address our core markets through either a commercial, off-the-shelf (COTS) model or a commercially developed, military qualified (CDMQ) model. The products we develop under the COTS model are applicable to a range of commercial and government customers and markets, including military applications. CDMQ products are specifically designed to meet military specifications. In both the COTS and CDMQ product development models, we use internally generated funds for research and development, and we generally own all rights to the products and their design.

Markets  

Search and Rescue   Thermal imaging systems are used in airborne and shipborne search and rescue missions to rescue individuals in danger or distress on boats or vehicles, or wounded or lost in adverse conditions. Such systems are in use today by organizations such as the United States Army, United States Coast Guard, the United States Marine Corps, the United States Air National Guard and the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense.  

Force Protection   In instances where military or other personnel are deployed in hostile areas, thermal imaging systems mounted on towers or other platforms are deployed to identify and defeat potential threats at an early stage. Our systems are deployed for this purpose by the United States Army, United States Marine Corps and others worldwide.  

Border and Maritime Patrol   Thermal imaging systems are used in airborne, shipborne, hand-held and fixed installation applications for border and maritime surveillance, particularly at night, to enforce borders and coastal waters, to monitor national fishing boundaries and to prevent smuggling. Our cameras are currently deployed along numerous borders worldwide, including in the United States, Europe and the Middle East.  

Surveillance and Reconnaissance   Thermal imaging systems are used in surveillance and reconnaissance applications for the precise positioning of objects or people from substantial distances and for enhanced situational awareness, particularly at night or in conditions of reduced or obscured visibility. These systems are installed on fixed platforms, manned mobile platforms, and unmanned aerial vehicles.  

Airborne Law Enforcement   We are a leader in the supply of stabilized airborne thermal imaging systems for federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Agencies with this type of equipment have the ability to track suspects, locate lost persons, and provide situational awareness to officers on the ground.  

Targeting   We offer several products that provide precise target location and designation capabilities in applications ranging from clip-on rifle scope devices to high-precision, stabilized, airborne laser designator systems.  

Federal Drug Interdiction   Thermal imaging systems enable government agencies to expand their drug interdiction and support activities by allowing greater surveillance and detection capabilities. Our systems are in use by the United States Customs Service, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency and the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as by international government agencies.

Table of Contents 

 total are technical and customer support staff in the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific who provide application development, technical training and operational assistance to direct and indirect sales personnel as well as to customers.  

We enter into contracts and subcontracts which are subject to certain risks related to doing business with the United States government and may be subject to termination, reduction and/or amendment at the election of the United States government. For a discussion of these risks, see sections We depend on the United States government for a material portion of our business and changes in government spending could adversely affect our business and As a United States government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations in Item 1A Risk Factors.  

Government Systems typically has the highest backlog of our segments relative to revenue and in absolute terms. At December 31, 2010, Government Systems backlog totaled $325 million, compared with $433 million at December 31, 2009. The decline in Government Systems backlog is primarily due to significant deliveries in 2010 on certain large programs, primarily with US Government agencies, and reductions in US Government spending in 2010.  

Customers  

Government Systems customers generally consist of United States and international government agencies, including civilian, military, paramilitary, and police forces, as well as defense contractors and aircraft manufacturers. A substantial portion of our consolidated revenue is derived from sales to United States and international government agencies and our business will continue to be substantially dependent upon such sales. Aggregate sales to United States government agencies accounted for 34 percent of our consolidated revenue in 2010, 43 percent in 2009, and 41 percent in 2008. We expect revenue outside the United States to continue to account for a significant portion of our Government Systems revenue, as demand for our equipment is increasing rapidly outside the United States. The Government Systems segment is susceptible to some seasonality in its orders primarily based on the United States government budget year end. The result is that the third quarter tends to exhibit the largest amount of orders for our Government Systems segment. However, fiscal policy trends, budget delays, and general economic trends can overshadow this seasonality in any given year.  

Competition  

The Government Systems segment operates in highly competitive markets that evolve rapidly with the advent of new technologies and requirements. Many of our competitors in the government sector are well established contractors for various governments and have more financial and other resources than we possess. The principal competitive factors in the government markets include technical innovation, agency relationships, product quality and reliability, price and ability to deliver. We believe we compete successfully in these markets with our best-in-class technologies, our products abilities to outperform customer requirements and competitors products, our lower priced solutions that result from our commercial operating model, and our service and support functions that exist in the field and near the customer. Our current principal competitors in the Government Systems markets include divisions of BAE Systems, DRS (a Finmeccanica company), Elbit Systems, General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Sagem, Smiths Group, Sofradir, and Thales.  

ICx

Research & Development  

Our success has been and will be in the future substantially affected by our ability to innovate new products and technologies that both augment our existing solutions and create new avenues for growth. We strive to differentiate ourselves from our competition with our R&D operations. Our internally funded research and development expenses were $116.4 million, $91.3 million, and $90.0 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. We intend to continue to have significant internal research and development expenses in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative and high quality products to maintain and enhance our competitive position in each of our business segments. In addition to these internally-funded amounts, in 2010, 2009, 2008, we spent $12.3 million, $5.4 million, and $6.0 million, respectively, on research and development projects that were reimbursed by government agencies or prime contractors pursuant to development contracts we undertook.  

Focusing on projects that have the highest probability for commercial marketability, our R&D teams are located within our business segments. These teams work to develop products that will fulfill their specific customers constantly evolving needs while also sharing findings, successes, technologies, tools, and best practices with one another. One method that our R&D teams use to ensure our new products evolve with our customers is a spiral development process. This process is particularly useful within our Government Systems R&D teams in that it facilitates rapid field testing and refinement of new technologies in order to get end-users the critical protection and information tools they need as quickly as possible. A key tenet of the spiral development philosophy is seeking and receiving end-user feedback on new or upgraded products. Engineers in the field work with the end-users in real-time in order to revise and tune products quickly and efficiently. The solicitation and effectiveness of the end-user feedback has proven integral to our success in creating the most technologically advanced yet user-friendly solutions.  

Proprietary Rights  

We have numerous patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property that are important for our success. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, and trade secret laws, confidentiality agreements, and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Our intellectual property provides important competitive advantages, and we have intensified our efforts to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation. We will continue to actively seek intellectual property protection for our innovations and intend to emphasize initiatives that will promote innovation and leadership in marketable technology. We cannot, however, be certain or give any assurance that we can maintain our competitive advantage or that competitors will not develop similar or superior capabilities.  

Manufacturing  

We manufacture many of the critical components for our products, including infrared detectors, gimbals, pan-tilts, optics and coatings, laser sub-systems and micro-coolers, and develop much of the necessary software and middleware for our systems. This vertical integration minimizes lead times, facilitates prompt delivery of our products, controls costs and ensures that these components satisfy our quality standards. We purchase other parts pre-assembled, including certain detectors, certain coolers and optics, circuit boards, cables and wire harnesses. These purchased and manufactured components are then assembled into finished systems and tested at one of our primary production facilities located in the U.S., Sweden, Estonia, France, Germany and Canada. Certain components and finished goods are produced by contract manufacturers.  

Our manufacturing operations are, from time to time, audited by certain OEM customers, which include several major aircraft manufacturers, and have been certified as meeting their quality standards. Substantially all of our manufacturing locations are either ISO 9001:2000 or :2008 certified with certain locations having higher certifications.
