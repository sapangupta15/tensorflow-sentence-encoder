 Business Overview  

 As a global business, AMETEKs operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the Companys strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. In 2007, the Company continued to experience strong market conditions in many of its businesses. Strong internal growth and the contributions from recent acquisitions, combined with successful Operational Excellence initiatives, enabled the Company to post another year of record sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share, and cash flow from operating activities in 2007. In addition to achieving its financial objectives, the Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEKs four growth strategies: Operational Excellence, New Product Development, Global and Market Expansion, and Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances. Highlights of 2007 were:  

       Sales were $2.1 billion, an increase of $318 million or 17% from 2006 on solid internal growth of approximately 9% in the Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) and 6% in the Electromechanical Group (EMG), and contributions from the following acquisitions completed during the year:    

       In April 2007, the Company acquired Seacon Phoenix, subsequently renamed Sea Connect Products (SCP), a provider of undersea electrical interconnect subsystems. The SCP acquisition is an excellent strategic fit with the Companys engineered materials, interconnects and packaging business and extends the Companys reach into new defense markets.   

       In June 2007, the Company acquired Hamilton Precision Metals, Inc. (Hamilton), a niche specialty metals producer. The Hamilton acquisition is a strategic fit with our engineered materials, interconnects and packaging business and has strong positions in growing specialty metals niche markets within the aerospace and other industrial markets.   

       In June 2007, the Company acquired two aerospace businesses; B&S Aircraft Parts & Accessories (B&S) and Advanced Industries, Inc. (Advanced) that serve the business jet, regional jet and helicopter markets. These businesses strengthen the Companys position in the aircraft power management and third-party maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) markets.   

       In August 2007, the Company acquired CAMECA SAS (Cameca), a manufacturer of high-end elemental analysis systems used in advanced laboratory research, semiconductor and nanotechnology applications. The Cameca acquisition broadens the Companys technical capabilities in high-end elemental analysis systems.   

       In November 2007, the Company acquired the Repair & Overhaul Division of Umeco plc (Umeco), a leading independent provider of MRO services in the aviation industry in Europe. The Umeco acquisition provides third-party MRO services for a variety of helicopters and commercial and regional aircraft throughout Europe.    

 21   

       In December 2007, the Company acquired California Instruments Corporation, a leader in programmable alternating current (AC) power sources used to test electrical and electronic products, with an especially strong position in the high-power segment of the market.    

       As the Company grows globally, it continues to achieve an increasing level of international sales. International sales, including U.S. export sales, represented 49.3% of consolidated sales in 2007, compared with 47.6% of consolidated sales in 2006.   

       Higher earnings resulted in record cash flow from operating activities that totaled $278.5 million, a $52.5 million or 23.2% increase from 2006. At year-end 2007, our total debt-to-capital ratio was 42.1% compared with 41.4%, at the end of 2006.   

       The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research, development and engineering, spending $102.9 million in 2007 before customer reimbursement of $7.1 million, an increase of 17.5% over 2006. Sales from products introduced in the last three years increased $24.4 million or 6.6% in 2007 to $391.3 million.   

       In June 2007, the Company amended its revolving credit facility, increasing the total borrowing capacity from $400 million to $550 million, which includes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $100 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain conditions. The amendment also extended the term of the facility from October 2011 to June 2012. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $525.3 million available under its revolving credit facility, including the $100 million accordion feature.   

       In the third quarter of 2007, the Company completed a private placement to sell $450 million in senior notes to a group of institutional investors. There are two funding dates for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in December 2007 for $370 million, consisting of $270 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.20% senior notes due December 2017 and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.30% senior notes due December 2019. The second funding date will be in July 2008 for $80 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% senior notes due July 2018.

 Results of Operations  

 In 2007, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. The Company achieved these results from strong internal growth in both its EIG and EMG groups, as well as contributions from acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. Operating income increased, driven by the record sales and a continued focus on cost reduction programs under our Operational Excellence initiatives. Based on strength in the Companys long-cycle businesses, our global customer base, the full-year impact of 2007 acquisitions, and our Operational Excellence capabilities, the Company expects continued strength in operating results in 2008.  

 The Company reported sales for 2007 of $2,136.9 million, an increase of $317.6 million or 17.5% from sales of $1,819.3 million in 2006. Net sales for EIG were $1,199.8 million in 2007, an increase of 18.0% from sales of $1,016.5 million in 2006. Net sales for EMG were $937.1 million in 2007, an increase of 16.7% from sales of $802.8 million in 2006. The Companys internal sales growth was approximately 7% in 2007, which excludes a 2% favorable effect of foreign currency translation, driven by strength in its differentiated businesses. The acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the net sales increase.  

 Total international sales for 2007 increased to $1,053.7 million and represented 49.3% of consolidated sales, an increase of $187.7 million, or 21.7% when compared with international sales of $866.0 million or 47.6% of consolidated sales in 2006. The increase in international sales resulted from increased international sales from base businesses of $74.9 million, or 39.9% of the increase, which includes the effect of foreign currency translation. The recent acquisitions of Cameca, SCP, Hamilton and Umeco in 2007 and Land Instruments, Pittman, Precitech and Southern Aeroparts in 2006 contributed the remainder of the increase. Increased international sales came mainly from sales to Europe by both reportable groups. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $394.4 million in 2007, an increase of $50.6 million or 14.7% compared with $343.8 million in 2006. Export shipments improved primarily due to increased exports from the base businesses and acquisitions noted above.  

 New orders for 2007 were $2,288.3 million, compared with $1,915.4 million for 2006, an increase of $372.9 million or 19.5%. The increase in orders was driven by the Companys base differentiated businesses, which contributed $167.2 million, or 44.8% of the increase, led by the Companys aerospace and engineered materials, interconnects and packaging businesses. The recent acquisitions mentioned above contributed the remainder of the increase. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2007 was $688.2 million, compared with $536.8 million at December 31, 2006, which is an increase of $151.4 million or 28.2%. The increase in backlog was due to higher order levels in base differentiated businesses and the 2007 acquisitions, noted above.  

 Segment operating income was $427.5 million for 2007, an increase of $84.1 million, or 24.5%, compared with segment operating income of $343.4 million for 2006. Segment operating margins in 2007 were 20.0% of sales, an increase from 18.9% of sales in 2006. The increase in segment operating income resulted from strength in the differentiated businesses of each group, which includes the profit contributions made by the acquisitions. The margin improvement came from the Companys differentiated businesses.  

 Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $263.5 million in 2007, compared with $219.5 million in 2006, an increase of $44.0 million or 20.1%. As a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses were higher in 2007 at 12.3% of sales compared to 12.1% of sales in 2006. Selling expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 10.4% in 2007, slightly higher than the 10.2% in 2006. The selling expense increase and the corresponding increase in selling expenses as a percentage of sales were due primarily to business acquisitions. The Companys acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher content of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses increased 9.7% for 2007, compared to 2006, which was in line with internal sales growth including the impact of foreign currency translation.  

 Corporate administrative expenses were $40.8 million in 2007, an increase of $6.6 million or 19.4%, when compared with 2006. The increase in corporate expenses is the result of higher compensation, including equity-based compensation associated with accelerated vesting of restricted stock grants in 2007 and other costs necessary  

 23   

 to grow the Company. As a percentage of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.9% in both 2007 and 2006.  

 Consolidated operating income was $386.6 million in 2007, an increase of $77.6 million or 25.1% when compared with $309.0 million in 2006. This represents an operating margin of 18.1% of sales for 2007 compared with 17.0% of sales in 2006.  

 Interest expense was $46.9 million in 2007, an increase of 11.1% compared with $42.2 million in 2006. The increase was due to higher average borrowings to fund the 2007 acquisitions, higher average interest rates and the impact of the initial funding of the private placement senior notes.  

 The effective tax rate for 2007 was 32.2% compared with 31.0% in 2006. The 2007 effective tax rate primarily reflects the elimination of the Foreign Sales Corporation/Extraterritorial Income (FSC/ETI) tax benefit in 2007, an increase in state income taxes, and an increase in interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, partially offset by an enacted decrease in certain foreign corporate tax rates in the second half of 2007 and the recognition of tax benefits from our international tax planning initiatives. The 2006 effective tax rate benefited primarily from the reversal of a valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carry forwards of $3.2 million, offset somewhat by higher nondeductible equity-based compensation.  

 Net income for 2007 was $228.0 million, an increase of $46.1 million, or 25.3% from $181.9 million in 2006. Diluted earnings per share increased 24.0% to $2.12 per share, an increase of $0.41 when compared with $1.71 per diluted share in 2006.  

 Operating Segment Results  

 EIGs sales were $1,199.8 million in 2007, an increase of $183.3 million or 18.0% from 2006 sales of $1,016.5 million. The sales increase was primarily due to internal growth of approximately 9%, excluding a favorable 2% effect of foreign currency translation. The internal growth was driven by sales increases in EIGs process and analytical, aerospace and power businesses. The acquisitions of Cameca, Land Instruments, Precitech, Advanced and B&S accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.  

 EIGs operating income for 2007 increased to $260.3 million from $203.4 million in 2006, an increase of $56.9 million, or 28.0%. Operating margins of EIG were 21.7% of sales for 2007 compared with operating margins of 20.0% of sales in 2006. The increase in segment operating income and margins came from the Groups base differentiated businesses, which include the acquisitions mentioned above.  

 EMGs sales for 2007 were $937.1 million, an increase of $134.3 million or 16.7%, compared with sales of $802.8 million in 2006. The sales increase was due in part to internal growth, particularly in EMGs differentiated businesses, which accounted for approximately 6%, excluding a favorable 2% effect of foreign currency translation. The acquisitions of Pittman, Southern Aeroparts, SCP, Umeco and Hamilton accounted for the remainder of the sales increase.  

 EMGs operating income for 2007 increased to $167.2 million from $139.9 million in 2006, an increase of $27.3 million or 19.5%. The operating income increase was due to strength in the Groups differentiated businesses, which includes the recent acquisitions mentioned above. EMGs operating margins were 17.8% of sales in 2007 compared with 17.4% of sales in 2006. The increase in operating margin was primarily due to an increased contribution from the Groups differentiated businesses.  

 Year Ended December 31, 2006, Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2005  

 Results of Operations  

 In 2006, the Company posted record sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. The Company achieved these results from strong internal growth in both its EIG and EMG groups, as well as contributions from acquisitions in 2006 and 2005. Operating income increased, driven by the record sales and a continued focus on cost reduction programs under our Operational Excellence initiatives.  

 24   

 The Company reported sales for 2006 of $1,819.3 million, an increase of $384.8 million or 26.8% from sales of $1,434.5 million in 2005. Net sales for EIG were $1,016.5 million in 2006, an increase of 25.7% from sales of $808.5 million in 2005. EIGs internal sales growth was 9% in 2006, driven by strength in its process, aerospace and power businesses. The acquisitions of SPECTRO in June 2005, Solartron in September 2005, Pulsar in February 2006 and Land Instruments in June 2006 also contributed to the sales growth. Net sales for EMG were $802.8 million in 2006, an increase of 28.2% from sales of $626.0 million in 2005. EMGs internal sales growth was also 9% in 2006 driven by the groups differentiated businesses. The acquisitions of HCC in October 2005 and Pittman in May 2006 also contributed to the sales growth.  

 Total international sales for 2006 increased to $866.0 million and represented 47.6% of consolidated sales, an increase of $210.1 million, or 32.0% when compared with international sales of $655.9 million or 45.7% of consolidated sales in 2005. The increase in international sales resulted from the acquisitions of SPECTRO, Solartron and HCC in 2005 and the Land Instruments acquisition in 2006, as well as increased international sales from base businesses. Increased international sales came mainly from sales to Asia and Europe by both reportable groups. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $343.8 million in 2006, an increase of $76.5 million or 28.6% compared with $267.3 million in 2005. Export shipments improved primarily due to increased exports from base businesses.  

 New orders for 2006 were $1,915.4 million, compared with $1,534.3 million for 2005, an increase of $381.1 million or 24.8%. The increase in orders was driven by demand in the Companys differentiated businesses, led by the Companys process businesses as well as the acquisitions mentioned above. The order backlog at December 31, 2006 was $536.8 million, compared with $440.7 million at December 31, 2005, an increase of $96.1 million or 21.8%. The increase in backlog was due to higher order levels in base differentiated businesses as well as the 2006 acquisitions.  

 Segment operating income was $343.4 million for 2006, an increase of $79.9 million, or 30.3%, compared with segment operating income of $263.5 million for 2005. Segment operating margins in 2006 were 18.9% of sales, an increase from 18.4% of sales in 2005. The increase in segment operating income resulted from strength in the differentiated businesses of each group, which includes the profit contributions made by the acquisitions. The margin improvement came from the Companys differentiated businesses.  

 Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses were $219.5 million in 2006, compared with $174.2 million in 2005, an increase of $45.2 million or 26.0%. However, as a percentage of sales, SG&A expenses in 2006 were flat with 2005 at 12.1% of sales. Selling expenses, as a percentage of sales, were 10.2% in 2006, essentially unchanged from 2005. Most of the increase in selling expenses was due to the acquired businesses. The Companys acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses, which because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs tend to have a higher content of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses increased 4.9% which is significantly lower than the Companys 9% internal sales growth rate for 2006.  

 Corporate administrative expenses were $34.2 million in 2006, an increase of $4.5 million or 15.3%, when compared with 2005. The increase in corporate expenses is the result of higher compensation costs, including equity-based compensation. As a percentage of sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.9% in 2006, a decline from 2.1% of sales in 2005.  

 Consolidated operating income was $309.0 million in 2006, an increase of $75.5 million or 32.3% when compared with $233.5 million in 2005. This represents an operating margin of 17.0% of sales for 2006 compared with 16.3% of sales in 2005.  

 Interest expense was $42.2 million in 2006, an increase of 28.1% compared with $32.9 million in 2005. The increase was due to higher average borrowings necessary to fund the 2005 and 2006 acquisitions, primarily related to the euro long-term debt incurred for the 2005 acquisition of SPECTRO and short-term debt incurred for the late 2005 acquisition of HCC.  

 The effective tax rate for 2006 was 31.0% compared with 31.2% in 2005. The 2006 effective tax rate benefited primarily from the reversal of a valuation allowance for foreign tax credit carryforwards of $3.2 million, offset somewhat by higher nondeductible equity-based compensation. The 2006 and 2005 effective tax rates benefited  

 25   

 from the realization of tax benefits stemming from the Companys worldwide tax planning activities and other adjustments.  

 Net income for 2006 was $181.9 million, an increase of $45.5 million, or 33.4% from $136.4 million in 2005. Diluted earnings per share increased 32.6% to $1.71 per share, an increase of $0.42 when compared with $1.29 per diluted share in 2005.  

 Operating Segment Results  

 EIGs sales were $1,016.5 million in 2006, an increase of $208.0 million or 25.7% from 2005 sales of $808.5 million. The sales increase was due to internal growth in EIGs process, aerospace and power businesses, and the acquisitions of SPECTRO and Solartron in 2005 and Pulsar and Land Instruments in 2006. Included in the 25.7% increase in sales is internal growth of approximately 9%. The acquisitions accounted for the remainder of the sales increase. The foreign currency translation effect on sales for 2006 was nominal.  

 EIGs operating income for 2006 increased to $203.4 million from $164.2 million in 2005, an increase of $39.2 million, or 23.9%. The increase in operating income was driven by the higher sales, which includes the acquisitions. Operating margins of EIG were 20.0% of sales for 2006 compared with operating margins of 20.3% of sales in 2005. The decrease in operating margins was due to the inclusion of a $4.3 million gain from the sale of a facility in 2005.  

 EMGs sales for 2006 were $802.8 million, an increase of $176.8 million or 28.2%, compared with sales of $626.0 million in 2005. The sales increase was due in part to internal growth, particularly in EMGs differentiated businesses, which accounted for approximately 9% of the 28.2% sales increase. The acquisitions of HCC in October 2005 and Pittman in May 2006 accounted for the remainder of the sales increase. The foreign currency translation effect on sales for 2006 was nominal.  

 EMGs operating income for 2006 increased to $139.9 million from $99.2 million in 2005, an increase of $40.7 million or 41.0%. The operating income increase was significantly due to higher sales from the Groups differentiated businesses, which includes the acquisitions mentioned above. EMGs operating margins were 17.4% of sales in 2006 compared with operating margins of 15.9% of sales in 2005. The increase in operating margin was primarily due to a higher profit yield on the sales contribution of EMGs differentiated businesses.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 Cash provided by operating activities totaled $278.5 million for 2007, compared with $226.0 million in 2006, an increase of $52.5 million, or 23.2%. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily the result of higher earnings and lower pension contributions, partially offset by higher overall operating working capital investments necessary to grow the business. In 2007, the Company contributed $5.2 million to its defined benefit pension plans compared to $13.7 million contributed in 2006. Free cash flow (operating cash flow less capital spending) was $240.9 million in 2007, compared to $196.8 million in 2006. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $433.9 million in 2007, compared with $351.4 million in 2006, a 23.5% improvement. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that there are measures that are used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See table on page 20 for a reconciliation of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).  

 Cash used for investing activities was $334.7 million for 2007, compared with $206.0 million in 2006. In 2007, the Company paid $300.6 million for seven businesses and one technology line, net of cash received and also assumed $24.9 million of debt and long-term liabilities. In 2006, the Company paid $177.6 million for five acquisitions and two small technology lines, net of cash received. Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $37.6 million in 2007, compared with $29.2 million in 2006.  

 Cash provided from financing activities totaled $174.1 million in 2007, compared with cash used of $10.0 million in 2006. In 2007, total borrowings, net of repayments, increased by $180.9 million, compared with a net increase of $15.4 million in 2006. Short-term borrowings decreased $162.6 million in 2007, compared with an increase of $4.0 million in 2006. Long-term borrowings increased $343.4 million in 2007, compared to an increase of $11.3 million in 2006.  

 26   

 In June 2007, the Company amended its revolving credit facility, increasing the total borrowing capacity from $400 million to $550 million, which includes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $100 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain conditions. The amendment also extended the term of the facility from October 2011 to June 2012. At December 31, 2007, the Company had $525.3 million available under its revolving credit facility, including the $100 million accordion feature.  

 The accounts receivable securitization facility was amended and restated in May 2007 to increase the Companys available borrowing capacity from $75 million to $110 million as well as extend the expiration date from May 2007 to May 2008. There were no borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2007.  

 In the third quarter of 2007, the Company completed a private placement agreement to sell $450 million in senior notes to a group of institutional investors. There are two funding dates for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in December 2007 for $370 million, consisting of $270 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.20% senior notes due December 2017 and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.30% senior notes due December 2019. The second funding date will be in July 2008 for $80 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.35% senior notes due July 2018. The Notes will carry a weighted average interest rate of approximately 6.25%. The proceeds from the first funding of the notes were used to pay down the Companys revolving credit facility, which included a foreign portion related to the 2007 acquisition of Cameca SAS and the 2006 acquisition of Land Instruments, as well as borrowings outstanding under the Companys accounts receivable securitization program. Additionally, the proceeds from the private placement were used to purchase California Instruments in December 2007. The residual cash balance ($86.6 million) at year-end 2007 is invested in short-term cash equivalent money market funds. The Company has a $225 million 7.20% senior note due July 2008. It is the Companys current intention to repay the 7.20% senior note in July 2008 with the remaining proceeds from the $450 million private placement and borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility.  

 At December 31, 2007, total debt outstanding was $903.0 million compared with $681.9 million at December 31, 2006. The total debt-to-capital ratio was 42.1% at December 31, 2007, compared with 41.4% at December 31, 2006. The net debt-to-capital ratio (total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by the sum of net debt and stockholders equity) was 37.1% at December 31, 2007, compared with 39.6% at December 31, 2006. The net debt-to-capital ratio is presented because the Company is aware that this measure is used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See page 20 for reconciliation of GAAP measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).  

 In 2007, net cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options were $17.2 million, compared with $9.9 million in 2006. Cash dividends paid were $25.7 million in 2007 and $18.8 million in 2006. The increase in dividends paid was a result of a Board of Directors-approved 50% increase in the quarterly dividend rate on the Companys common stock in the fourth quarter of 2006.  

 In 2007, the Company used cash of $5.4 million for the repurchase of 144,000 shares of its common stock. In 2006, the Company used cash of $21.1 million for the repurchase of 750,000 shares of its common stock. As of December 31, 2007, $25.9 million was available, under the then current Board authorization, for future share repurchases. On January 24, 2008, the Board of Directors authorized an increase of $50 million in the authorization for the repurchase of its common stock. This increase will be added to the $25.9 million that remained available from an existing $50 million authorization approved in March 2003, for a total of $75.9 million available for repurchases of the Companys common stock. Subsequent to December 31, 2007, the Company has repurchased an additional 1,000,057 shares of its common stock for approximately $43.5 million. Therefore, the remaining balance available for repurchases of the Companys common stock is $32.4 million as of the filing of this report.

 The following table summarizes AMETEKs contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2007, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flows in future years.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Includes the first funding ($370 million) of the $450 million private placement. The $370 million funding consisted of $270 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.20% senior notes due December 2017 and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.30% senior notes due December 2019. The proceeds from the first funding of the private placement were used to repay borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility, including the euro and British pound portions, and borrowings outstanding under the Companys accounts receivable securitization program.  

  (b)    Represents a capital lease for a building and land associated with the Cameca acquisition. The lease has a term of twelve years, which began July 2006, and is payable quarterly.  

  (c)    Purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.  

  (d)    The liability for uncertain tax positions was not included in the table of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 because the timing of the settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See income tax footnote for further details (See Note 10).   

 Other Commitments  

 The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of approximately $26.3 million related to performance and payment guarantees at December 31, 2007. Based on experience with these arrangements, the Company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position.  

 The Company may, from time to time, redeem, tender for, or repurchase its long-term debt in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon availability, market conditions and other factors.  

 As a result of all of the Companys cash flow activities in 2007, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2007 totaled $170.1 million, compared with $49.1 million at December 31, 2006. The Company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities, and access to long-term capital funds to enable it to meet operating needs and contractual commitments in the foreseeable future.  

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations, and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. The consolidated  

 28   

 financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the Companys accounting policies and to managements discussion and analysis. The information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the Companys accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective decisions, or assessments whereby materially different results of operations and financial condition could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of the Companys significant accounting policies is in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this report.

      carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The Company would be required to record such impairment losses. Indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill are tested by estimating the fair values of those assets as of the Companys measurement date, with such fair values based on expected future operating performance and discount rates determined by management. Changes in interest rates and market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates. These estimates will likely change over time. The Companys acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2007, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $1,358.1 million, or 49.4% of the Companys total assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007 and determined that the Companys goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.    

       Pensions. The Company has U.S. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. AMETEK accounts for all of its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158), for balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as the income statement recognition of the costs related to these plans. SFAS 87 and SFAS 158 require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. The most significant elements in determining the Companys pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2007, the Company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments. The discount rate used in determining the 2007 pension cost was 5.9% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 5.0% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2007, and determining the 2008 defined benefit pension cost is 6.25% for U.S. plans and 5.89% for foreign plans. In estimating the U.S. discount rate, the Companys actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the Plans projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. In estimating the foreign plans discount rate, the Company looks to rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments with maturities consistent with the projected benefit cash flows of the foreign plans. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2007 of 8.25% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 7.00% for foreign plans. We will continue to use these rates for 2008 for the U.S. and foreign plans, respectively. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income investments and equity investments, and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in determining the 2007 pension expense for the U.S. plans was 3.75% and will remain unchanged in 2008. For foreign plans, the rate of compensation increase will be increased from 3.61% in 2007 to 3.86% in 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company recognized consolidated pretax pension income of $3.8 million from its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans. This compares with pretax pension expense of $2.5 million recognized for these plans in 2006, which included $0.8 million for pension curtailments.    

 The Company follows the balance sheet recognition requirements of SFAS 158. Under SFAS 158, all unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets, and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized net of tax effects as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in stockholders equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. In addition, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, the measurement date (the date at which plan assets and benefit obligation are measured) is required to be the Companys fiscal year-end. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date for all of our U.S. defined benefit plans, and as required by SFAS 158,  

 30   

 will adopt a December 31 measurement date for our foreign plans in 2008, changing from the October 1 measurement date currently used for such plans.  

 To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans during 2007 which totaled $5.2 million, compared with $13.7 million in 2006. The Company anticipates making cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2008 at a level similar to those made in 2007.  

       Income Taxes. The process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. We conduct a broad range of operations around the world, subjecting us to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of our tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.    

 We assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets, taking into consideration our forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, we must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.  

 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. In accordance with FIN 48, we are required to assess the uncertainty in our tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice.  

 As a result of the adoption of FIN 48, the company recognized a $4.7 million increase in liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits (UTB), including interest and penalties of $2.4 million and a decrease of $1.2 million in goodwill related to a previous business combination, and a $5.9 million charge to the January 1, 2007 opening balance of retained earnings.  

 Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards  

 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). FIN 48 creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 resulted in a noncash reduction of $5.9 million to the January 1, 2007 opening balance of retained earnings (See Note 10).  

 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06-5, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance  Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85-4 (EITF 06-5). EITF 06-5 provides guidance in determining the amount to be realized under certain insurance contracts and the related disclosures. Adoption of EITF 06-5 did not have any effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 applies under  

 31   

 other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued a Staff Position No. 157-2, which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are not currently recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 157 on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

 In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS 159) which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. This statement permits an entity to elect to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value at specified election dates. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have an effect on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R). This statement significantly changes the financial accounting and reporting of business combination transactions in the Companys consolidated financial statements. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and prohibits early adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 141R on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160). This statement significantly changes the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling (minority) interests in the Companys consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008 and prohibits early adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting SFAS 160 on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  

 Internal Reinvestment  

 Capital Expenditures  

 Capital expenditures were $37.6 million or 1.8% of sales in 2007, compared with $29.2 million, or 1.6% of sales in 2006. Approximately 56% of the expenditures in 2007 were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. The Companys 2007 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. For 2008, capital expenditures are expected to approximate $48 million, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity. The 2008 capital expenditures are expected to approximate 2% of sales.  

 Product Development and Engineering  

 Product development and engineering expenses are directed toward the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes. Such expenses before customer reimbursement were $102.9 million in 2007, an increase from $87.6 million in 2006, and $75.9 million in 2005. Customer reimbursements were $7.1 million, $6.4 million, and $8.9 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Included in the amounts above are net expenses for research and development of $52.9 million for 2007, $42.0 million for 2006, and $34.8 million for 2005.  

 Environmental Matters  

 Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. While these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time, at December 31, 2007 the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 15 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). The Company is identified as a de minimis party in 12 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In 10 of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other two sites, the  

 32   

 Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. In the three remaining sites where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys expected obligation. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates, and the amounts accrued in the financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the financial statements. In estimating our liability for remediation, we also consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.  

 Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $25.3 million and $28.7 million, respectively for non-owned and owned sites. In 2007, the Company provided $1.5 million of additional reserves for environmental liabilities. The Companys reserves for environmental liabilities at December 31, 2007 and 2006 include reserves of $18.0 million and $21.2 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the fiscal 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (HCC). The Company is solely liable for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a large Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2007, the Company has $12.6 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. In addition, the Company is indemnified by HCCs former owners for up to $19.0 million of additional costs.  

 The Company also has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects; however, one of these companies recently filed for bankruptcy liquidation. AMETEK has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made, and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.  

 Market Risk  

 The Companys primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Companys differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating earnings as a whole.  

 The Companys short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. These financial instruments are more fully described in the notes to the financial statements.  

 The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi and the Mexican peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate  

 33   

 fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the occasional use of local borrowings and derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income, within stockholders equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.  

 The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, copper, steel and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities is generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product, and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.  

 Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates, our best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments, and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.  

 Forward-Looking Information  

 Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) of 1995, which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Companys operations and business environment, and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Companys actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the Companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item 1A.-Risk Factors. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.
