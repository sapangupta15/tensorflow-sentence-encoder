Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and Torchmarks Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

How Torchmark Views Its Operations: Torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance, and to a limited extent annuities, to middle income households throughout the United States. We view our operations by segments, which are the major insurance product lines of life, health, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. Segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment.  

Insurance Product Line Segments. As fully described in Note 13Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and benefit administration of policies. Each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies. Each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. Whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution units within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, which is:  

Premium revenue  

Less:  

 Policy obligations  

 Policy acquisition costs and commissions  

Investment Segment. The investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity. Our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, which is:  

Net investment income  

Less:  

 Interest credited to net policy liabilities  

 Financing costs  

The tables in Note 13Business Segments reconcile Torchmarks revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three-year period ending December 31, 2008. Additionally, this Note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year-to-year comparability and which reconciles to net income. That summary is reproduced below from the Consolidated Financial Statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business.

Torchmarks operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report.  

Summary of Operations: Net income declined $75 million or 14% to $452 million in 2008. On a diluted per share basis, net income declined 7% to $5.11. The primary cause for the 2008 decline was after-tax realized investment losses of $70 million ($108 million before tax). These losses were due mostly to writedowns of fixed-maturity securities issued by Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual. In 2007, net income grew 2% or $9 million over the prior year to $528 million. On a per share basis, 2007 net income grew 7% to $5.50. Per share earnings growth exceeded the growth in dollar earnings in both periods as a result of our share repurchase program discussed later under this caption. Life insurance was our strongest performing segment in both years, contributing $15 million to 2008 pretax growth and $20 million to 2007 growth. Margin improvements in this segment were a result of premium growth and lower obligation ratios in both periods. The investment segment also contributed to the growth in pretax income in each year, rising $4 million in 2008 and $5 million in 2007. Excess investment income, measuring the profit of the investment segment, was benefited by reduced financing costs and growth in the size of the investment portfolio in both years. The growth in excess investment income was attained even though significant cash flow has been used to buy Torchmark stock in all three periods.  

In 2008, the contributions to growth in our life insurance and investment segments were more than offset by declines in our annuity and health segments. Our 2008 annuity underwriting loss was $6 million, compared with gains of $9 million in 2007 and $12 million in 2006. In 2008, declines in equity markets have caused variable policyholder account values to decline, guaranteed minimum death benefit costs to increase, policyholders to withdraw funds, and changes in actuarial assumptions all of which have resulted in the underwriting losses. We do not emphasize this segment and have discontinued the sale of variable annuities in 2008, only offering a fixed annuity product. Health insurance underwriting margin improved $2 million to $208 million in 2007, but declined 7% or $14 million in 2008 to $195 million. This   

17  

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

 segment has experienced increased competition in recent periods, especially in 2008, which has caused a decline in agent count resulting in a significant reduction in new sales.  

Total revenues declined 5% in 2008 to $3.33 billion. In 2007, total revenues rose 2% to $3.49 billion from $3.42 billion in 2006. Life premium rose $47 million in 2008 and $46 million in 2007, while net investment income rose $23 million in 2008 and $20 million in 2007. Growth in these two revenue components accounted for the increase in 2007 revenues. However, 2008 revenues were negatively affected by the aforementioned pretax realized loss of $108 million and a decline in health premium of $110 million, described further under this caption.  

Life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending December 31, 2008, rising 3% in 2008 to $1.62 billion and also 3% in 2007. Margins as a percentage of premium have also increased slightly each year to 27% of premium in 2008 and 2007 from 26% in 2006. Life net sales rose 13% in 2008 to $298 million, after having declined slightly in the two preceding years. Net sales rose in each of the three major life distribution channels in 2008. Life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption Life Insurance.  

We market three primary health insurance products: under-age-65 limited-benefit health insurance, Medicare Supplement insurance, and the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. Health premium declined 9% in 2008 to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion in 2007. Health premium was flat in 2007 with 2006. The primary factor in the 2008 decline was the decline in agent count in our United American Branch Office during the year, our largest health producer. This agency has experienced intense competition, which has resulted in a significant decrease in new health sales and has negatively impacted premium income. Efforts are underway to rebuild this agency. Prior to 2008, this agency had been instrumental in the growth in the sales of our limited-benefit health product, as demand for this product had increased. Accordingly, premium from the limited-benefit product has grown significantly in relation to Medicare Supplement premium in recent years. While Medicare Supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium, increased competition has also dampened sales of this product resulting in premium declines in each successive year. Also, 2008 was our third year of offering Medicare Part D insurance. As most of the countrys Part D enrollees selected a plan provider in 2006, we do not expect growth in our Part D business going forward. See the discussion under Health Insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results.  

While we still offer fixed annuities, we do not emphasize sales of annuity products, favoring life insurance instead. See the caption Annuities for further discussion of the Annuity segment.  

As previously mentioned, the investment segments pretax profitability, or excess investment income, increased $4 million in 2008 and $5 million in 2007. It had declined 2% in the previous year. This segment benefited from lower financing costs in each successive year. In 2008, these costs declined primarily due to lower rates and a lower average balance on our short-term debt. In 2007, our interest expense on funded debt declined due to the refinancing of the two funded debt issues noted below. Prior to 2008, the average yield on new investments acquired had been lower than the average portfolio yield, restricting growth in net investment income in relation to the size of the portfolio. In 2008, however, the yield on new investments exceeded the portfolio yield by 25 basis points. Growth in total investment income has been negatively affected by Torchmarks share repurchase program (described later under this caption), which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments. Management believes that the acquisition of Torchmark stock at favorable prices provides a superior return on available cash.  

Torchmarks current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investment-grade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities (often exceeding twenty years) that meet our quality and yield objectives. Approximately 93% of our invested assets at fair value consists of fixed maturities of which 94% was investment grade at December 31, 2008. The average quality rating of the portfolio was BBB+. The portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or Alt-A mortgages, no residential mortgages, no counterparty risks, no credit default swaps, or derivative contracts. See the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption Investments in this report and Note 3Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Statements of Operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment.

As mentioned earlier in this summary, we wrote down certain fixed maturities and equities during 2008, including bonds issued by Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, and various other institutions in the pretax amount of $106 million. The write downs were taken as these securities met our criteria for other-than-temporary impairment. These writedowns compared with $11 million taken in 2007 and none in 2006. Please refer to Note 3Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Other-than-temporary impairments for more information on these writedowns and our criteria for consideration of other-than-temporary impairment. Including the writedowns, we had total after-tax realized investment losses of $70 million in 2008 ($.79 per share), compared with a $2 million gain in 2007 ($.02 per share), and a $7 million loss in 2006 ($.07 per share). Realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and may have a material positive or negative impact on net income. Under the caption Realized Gains and Losses in this report, we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses including the writedowns. Also, as explained in Note 13Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments.  

During the second quarter of 2006, we issued two new debt securities in separate public offerings: (1) our 7.1% Trust Preferred Securities, redemption amount $120 million and (2) our 6 3/8% Senior Notes, par value $250 million. These offerings essentially provided funding for the repayment of two existing debt instruments in the fourth quarter of 2006: (1) the call of our 7¾% Trust Preferred Securities at a redemption price of $150 million and (2) the maturity of our 6¼% Senior Notes, par value $180 million. More information on these transactions can be found in Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in our discussion of Capital Resources in this report.  

In each of the years 2006 through 2008, net income was affected by certain significant, unusual, and nonrecurring nonoperating items. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. A discussion of these items follows.  

As reported in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Litigation and Tax Settlements, we have been involved in a number of litigation issues over the course of the three year period 2006 through 2008 in which we either received settlements net of expenses or incurred settlement losses and expenses. These issues resulted in after-tax charges of $770 thousand in 2008, $272 thousand in 2007, and an after-tax benefit of $7.4 million in 2006. Additionally, as described under the same caption of Note 1, we received tax settlements in each year in the amounts of $10.8 million in 2008, $1.1 million in 2007, and $11.6 million in 2006. All of these litigation and tax issues pertained to issues arising many years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations. Legal expenses and litigation items pertaining to current operations are included in either insurance administrative expenses or parent expenses, as appropriate, in our segment analysis. As explained in Note 3Investments under the caption Other-than-temporary impairments, we wrote down certain company-occupied property to fair value during 2008. The write down resulted in an after-tax charge of $1.4 million.  

In 2006, Liberty began a program to dispose of its agency office buildings, replacing them with rental facilities. In 2006, 21 buildings were sold for gross proceeds of $6.7 million and a pre-tax gain of $4.8 million. In 2007, 21 additional buildings were sold for proceeds of $6.4 million and a pretax gain of $4.3 million ($2.8 million after tax). The program began to wind down in 2008 as five buildings were sold for proceeds of $787 thousand and a pretax gain of $278 thousand ($181 thousand after tax). Four buildings remained to be sold at December 31, 2008. Because of the significant scale of this nonoperating activity, we have removed $4.3 million ($2.8 million after tax) from our core results representing the gain in 2006 and the gains on the sales in 2007 and 2008.

Torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986 and was reaffirmed at its October 30, 2008 Board of Directors meeting. With no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the Companys excess cash flow, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. The majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. The following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended December 31, 2008.

Throughout the remainder of this discussion, share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings.  

A discussion of each of Torchmarks segments follows.  

Life Insurance. Life insurance is our largest insurance segment, with 2008 life premium representing 59% of total premium. Life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 70% of the total in 2008. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.  

Life insurance premium rose 3% to $1.62 billion in 2008 after having increased 3% in 2007 to $1.57 billion. Life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels. Premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows:  

LIFE INSURANCE  

Premium by Distribution Method  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: annualized premium in force, net sales, and first-year collected premium. Annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any   

20  

Table of Contents

 given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. Annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue. Net sales is annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Direct Response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. We believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued. First-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future.  

Annualized life premium in force was $1.71 billion at December 31, 2008, an increase of 2% over $1.67 billion a year earlier. Annualized life premium in force was $1.62 billion at December 31, 2006.  

The following table shows net sales information for each of the last three years by distribution method.

Direct Response is our leading writer of life insurance. The Direct Response operation consists of two primary components: direct mail and insert media. Direct mail targets primarily young middle-income households with children. The juvenile life insurance policy is a key product. Not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales, but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders. Parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a Direct Response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population. Also, both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition-cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time. At this time, we believe that the Direct Response unit is the largest U.S. writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance. We expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of Direct Responses premier markets.

Insert media, which targets primarily the adult market, involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media, such as coupon packets, newspapers, bank statements, and billings. This media was historically placed by Direct Marketing and Advertising Distributors, Inc. (DMAD), previously an unrelated entity with which we have had a business relationship for over fifteen years. We acquired DMAD in January, 2007 for $47 million, and integrated their operations during 2007. This acquisition allowed the Company to expand marketing opportunities through increased solicitation volume and also improve margins through cost savings in the insert media component.  

The Direct Response operation accounted for 32% of our life insurance premium during 2008, the largest of any distribution group. Direct Responses share of total life premium has risen steadily in each of the last three years as illustrated in the chart above. Life premium for this channel rose 6% in both 2008 and 2007. Net sales rose 8% in 2008 to $123 million after a 1% decline in 2007 to $114 million. First-year collected premium increased 5% in 2008 to $80 million after a 2% decline in 2007.  

The American Income Exclusive Agency focuses primarily on members of labor unions, but also on credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales. It is a high profit margin business characterized by lower policy obligation ratios. Life premium for this agency rose 8% to $474 million in 2008, after having also increased 8% in 2007. Net sales increased 17% in 2008 to $108 million from $92 million in 2007. Net sales rose 7% in 2007. First-year collected premium rose 11% in 2008 to $82 million, after having increased 2% in 2007. As in the case of all of Torchmarks agency distribution systems, continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count. Growth in the agent count has contributed to the improvements in sales in this agency. The American Income agent count was 3,085 at December 31, 2008 compared with 2,545 a year earlier, an increase of 21%. The agent count rose 8% in 2007 from 2,353 at year end 2006. This agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business. Additionally, the systematic, centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents.  

The Liberty National Exclusive Agency distribution system markets its life products to primarily middle-income customers in Southeastern states. Libertys life premium declined 2% in both 2008 and 2007 compared with the respective prior year. Libertys life premium sales, in terms of net sales, were $49 million in 2008, representing an increase of 31% in 2008. Net sales had declined 11% in 2007. First-year collected premium increased 3% in 2008 to $30 million, after having declined 16% in 2007.  

Growth in the Liberty Agencys sales and premium volume are highly dependent on building the size of its agency force. Liberty has implemented initiatives similar to those of American Income to recruit new agents, primarily through the use of the internet. The continued recruiting of new agents and the retention of productive agents are critical to growing the sales in controlled agency distribution systems. Libertys agent count rose 43% to 3,437 at December 31, 2008 from 2,410 a year earlier. This compared with an increase of 39% in 2007 but a decline of 20% in 2006. Most of the growth in the 2007 agent count occurred in the latter half of the year. As new agents become trained and more seasoned, they are expected to become more productive. The growth in 2008 net sales is attributable to the growth in the agent counts in 2008 and the latter part of 2007, while the 2007 decline in net sales was a result of the decline in agent counts in 2006 and early 2007. In 2006, the Liberty National Agency began the reorganization of its marketing leadership and restructured its agent compensation system to provide greater reward to productive agents and to establish production minimums for agents. These changes led to terminations and resignations during 2006 of agents not meeting these production minimums. However, management believes that these changes will result in a more productive agency over the long term. Management also believes these changes are responsible for recent margin improvements. A larger and more productive agency force should lead to increased sales, which in turn should result in increased premium growth.  

We also offer life insurance through Other Agencies consisting of the United Investors Agency, the Military Agency, the United American Independent and Branch Office Agencies, and other small miscellaneous sales agencies. The United Investors Agency is comprised of several independent agencies that concentrate on annuity business. United Investors represented 4% of Torchmarks 2008 life premium income. The Military Agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and   

22

Index to Financial Statements 

 noncommissioned military officers and their families. This business consists of whole-life products with term insurance riders. Military premium represented 12% of life premium. The United American Independent and Branch Office Agencies combined represented approximately 3% of Torchmarks total life premium. In the past, these agencies focused on health insurance, with life sales being incidental.  

LIFE INSURANCE  

Summary of Results  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Gross margins, as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense, rose 4% in 2008 to $432 million after rising 5% in 2007. As a percentage of life insurance premium, gross margins have increased slightly each year and were 27% in 2008. Improvements in life margins have resulted from several factors. Margin improvements in both 2008 and 2007 were primarily the result of premium growth, but favorable mortality was also a positive factor. This improvement in mortality is not expected to be a trend. An important factor in the 2008 increase was that American Incomes obligation ratios decreased from 34% to 32%. Additionally, the proportion of American Income premium to total premium has grown each year, and that has caused life margins to increase because that agencys margins are Torchmarks highest, well exceeding 30% in all periods.

Health Insurance. Health products sold by Torchmark insurance companies consist of supplemental plans that include limited-benefit hospital/surgical plans, cancer, and accident plans sold to people under age 65. We also sell Medicare Supplements to enrollees in the Federal Medicare program, as well as providing coverage under the Medicare Part D prescription drug program beginning January 1, 2006. Health premium represented 41% of Torchmarks total premium income in 2008. Excluding Part D premium, health premium represented 37% in 2008, compared with 39% in 2007 and 40% in 2006. Health underwriting margin, excluding Part D, accounted for 29% of the total in 2008, compared with 30% in 2007 and 31% in 2006. These declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment. Health results have also been negatively affected by increased competition in recent periods. The following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years.

Premium by Distribution Method  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 *   Total Medicare Part D premium and health premium exclude $7.3 million in 2007 of risk-sharing premium paid to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services consistent with the Medicare Part D contract. In 2008, $122 thousand of risk-sharing premium was received. This risk-sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims, and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis.  

We market supplemental health insurance products through a number of distribution channels with the two United American agencies being our market leaders. Over the past several years, we have placed greater emphasis on the sale of limited-benefit health insurance products to under-age-65 consumers rather than Medicare Supplement insurance as customer demand for the limited-benefit hospital/surgical

 plans has increased and price competition and lesser demand for Medicare Supplements has dampened the sales of that product. While Medicare Supplement still remains our largest health product in terms of premium income, the proportion of premium from other limited-benefit health products has grown steadily over the past few years. As shown in the chart above, Medicare Supplement premium represented 51% of total health premium (excluding Part D) in 2008.

The United American Branch Office and Independent Agencies. As discussed above, the two United American (UA) Agencies have emphasized sales of individual supplemental limited-benefit health plans known generally as hospital/surgical plans marketed to under-age-65 customers for which demand has increased in recent years. These plans generally provide a per diem payment for each hospital inpatient day confined, a fixed-amount surgical schedule, out patient coverage, and other miscellaneous hospital-related charges. They also contain caps on total per-illness benefits. Consumer interest in these products has increased as a result of growing unavailability or lack of affordability of individual major-medical plans and decreased coverage offered by employers. Minimum regulatory loss ratios on these limited-benefit plans are generally lower than those of Medicare Supplement; however, the Medicare Supplement product has historically had slightly higher persistency rates, resulting in both products having approximately the same underwriting margin as a percentage of premium. Both of the UA agencies offer these limited-benefit plans.  

26

Index to Financial Statements 

The UA Branch Office is an exclusive agency, meaning the agents in its 85 offices nationwide sell only for us. In recent years, this agency has focused its efforts on sales of limited-benefit products, and has been successful in building the sales of these plans replacing the decline in Medicare Supplement sales.  

In 2008, the UA Branch Office represented 51% of Torchmarks non-Medicare Part D sales. Beginning in late 2007 and throughout 2008, this agency has experienced increased agent turnover and a decline in agent count due to increased competition in the sales of health products. As a result, sales and premium at the UA Branch Office declined in 2008. As is the case with all of our captive agencies, growing the agency size translates into increased sales and premium growth. After growing very rapidly in periods prior to mid-2007, the producing agent count in the UA Branch Office has declined since that time. At year end 2008, the producing agent count was 1,583, compared with 2,979 at the end of 2007 and 3,015 at December 31, 2006. These declines in agent count have resulted in the declines in net sales and premium growth shown in the charts above, especially in 2008. Efforts are underway to rebuild this agency. Going forward, we are shifting the emphasis in the UA Branch Office Agency to life and health products currently marketed by Liberty National agents. These products are priced to achieve higher profit margins and have better persistency than UAs limited-benefit health insurance. We will continue to offer the current product portfolio, but the majority of our financial incentives will be used to encourage agents to sell the Liberty National product line. We believe this will improve the stability and profitability of the UA Branch Office Agency.  

The UA Independent Agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with Torchmark whose size range from very large, multi-state organizations down to one-person offices. All of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies, of which 2,838 were active producing agents for Torchmark at December 31, 2008. This agency is our largest carrier of Medicare Supplement insurance, with $278 million or 57% of our Medicare Supplement premium income in 2008. Overall, this agencys contribution to Torchmarks total health sales and premium has declined in each of the past three years, as a result of the increased competition in Medicare Supplement sales. Health premium for the UA Independent Agency declined 8% to $357 million in 2008, after declining 7% in 2007. The declines in premium have resulted as new sales have not compensated for lapses.  

The Liberty National Exclusive Agency, predominantly a life insurance distribution channel, is the third largest writer of Torchmark health business based on premium collected. Cancer supplemental plans are the type of limited-benefit health products primarily produced by this agency. Liberty is our only distribution channel for which cancer insurance is its primary health product. Libertys health premium declined 4% in 2008 to $135 million after a 3% drop in 2007. Several factors have contributed to the decline in health premium in this agency. Most notable has been the increased emphasis on sales of the higher-margin life products at Liberty. Another factor, prior to 2008, was the decline in agent count discussed earlier under the caption Life Insurance as a result of the change in the agent compensation system in 2006 to improve persistency and margins. However, recruiting and training initiatives have resulted in a significant increase in the Liberty agent count in 2008. Additionally, there was a settlement of a class-action lawsuit in early 2005 concerning a closed block of cancer business over the timing and size of the premium rate increases on this block. This block represented approximately half of Libertys cancer business at that time and approximately 37% at year end 2008. Prior to the settlement, significant rate increases to offset deteriorating margins on this block resulted in higher health premium, but increasing claims continued to reduce underwriting margins. The settlement provided for reduced benefits paid going forward and further required Liberty to reduce premiums and to maintain an 85% claims loss ratio over the remaining life of the business. Net health sales in the Liberty agency rose 22% to $12 million, compared with 2007 net health sales of $10 million. Net health sales had declined 16% from 2006 sales of $12 million.  

American Income Exclusive Agency, also predominantly a life insurance distribution channel, is our fourth largest health insurance distributor based on 2008 premium collected. Its health plans are comprised of various limited-benefit plans for which approximately 69% of the agencys 2008 health premium was from accident policies. Sales of the health plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer.  

Health premium at this agency rose 4% in 2008 to $73 million, after having increased 5% to $71 million in 2007. Net health sales were $11.8 million in 2008, compared with $11.3 million in 2007 and $11.7 million in 2006. Net health sales comprised less than 10% of the American Income Agencys total net sales in 2008.

Direct Response, primarily a life operation, also offers health insurance, which is predominantly Medicare Supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups. In 2008, net health sales were $6 million, comprising less than 5% of Direct Responses total life and health net sales. Direct Response health net sales and premium income have risen each year over the prior year. Net sales increased 7% in 2008 and 2% in 2007. Health premium rose 7% in both 2008 and 2007, increasing to $45 million in 2008.  

Medicare Part D. Torchmark, through its subsidiary United American, began offering insurance coverage under the governments Medicare Part D plan as of January 1, 2006. The Medicare Part D plan is a stand-alone prescription drug plan for Medicare beneficiaries. Part D is regulated and partially funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for participating private insurers like United American, unlike the traditional Medicare program for hospital and doctor services, where CMS is the primary insurer and private Medicare Supplement insurers are secondary insurers. The program generally calls for CMS to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured Medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium. Total Medicare Part D premium was $176 million in 2008, compared with $215 million in 2007 and $212 million in 2006. The decline in Part D premium resulted from the decline in the number of enrollees. Enrollment for all Part D coverages ends on December 31 of the previous year, except for enrollees who reach age 65 in the current year. At December, 2007, United American had approximately 158 thousand enrollees for the 2008 Part D plan, compared with 189 thousand for the 2007 plan year. Although final enrollment has not been confirmed, we do not expect a significant increase in enrollees for the 2009 plan year. Our Medicare Part D product is sold primarily through the Direct Response operation, but is also sold by the two UA agencies. Part D net sales were $28 million in 2008 and $25 million in 2007, compared with $278 million in 2006. We count only sales to new first-time enrollees in net sales and 2006 was the first year the Medicare Part D program was in effect. The majority of 2008 and 2007 premium income was from previous enrollees.  

We believe that the Medicare Part D program is an excellent addition to our health product offerings because of our experience with the senior-age market and with Medicare Supplements, the government assurances with regard to the risk-sharing agreements for participating insurers, the incremental income added to our health insurance margins, and the renewal of the business every year. Due to our experience with service to the senior-age market and the use of our existing Direct Response marketing system, entry to this business required little new investment. However, we do not expect growth in the Part D product in the near future, as most Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a plan in 2006. Additionally, as with any government-sponsored program, the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market.

Torchmarks health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense declined 7% in 2008 to $195 million, but has improved as a percentage of premium in each of the periods presented. Health margin rose 1% to $208 million in 2007. These increases were primarily the result of the reduced loss ratios in the previously-mentioned closed block of cancer business at Liberty and improvements in American Incomes loss ratios in each successive year. Libertys health margins increased $2 million or 5% in 2008 and $6 million or 20% in 2007. As a percentage of premium, Libertys health margin was 26% in 2008, compared with 24% in 2007 and 20% in 2006. American Incomes margins rose $2 million in both 2008 and 2007. They were 37% of premium in 2008 and 36% of 2007 premium.  

Annuities. Fixed annuity products are sold on a limited basis by our subsidiaries. Variable annuities were sold prior to 2008 but new sales were discontinued during the year. Annuities represented less than 1% of Torchmarks 2008 premium revenue. We do not emphasize this segment, and annuities continue to diminish in relation to our other operations.

Declines in equity markets during 2008 have had a significant effect on the variable policyholder account balance, as they have resulted in declines in value in the underlying investments and increased policyholder withdrawals. The decline in the size of the annuity account balance has had a negative impact on annuity underwriting income. An analysis of underwriting income is as follows.

Annuities generate earnings from periodic policy fees and charges to the account balances, reduced by net policy obligations and acquisition costs. Policy charges and underwriting margins have declined in each of the periods presented, primarily due to the declines in our variable annuity business. Because policy charge revenues for variable annuities are based on the size of the policyholders account value, policy charges have declined each period as declining equity markets, voluntary terminations, and lower sales have resulted in decreases in the variable account balance, especially in 2008. In addition to the revenue declines, underwriting income for the variable product has been negatively affected by two other factors. First, we have guaranteed minimum death benefits to variable policyholders providing that a certain minimum death benefit will be payable to them regardless of the policyholders account value upon death. For this reason, we provide a reserve for this benefit for which the cost increases as the policyholders account value declines. This reserve is subject to the periodic review of underlying assumptions and a revision or unlocking when experience so indicates. In 2008, the additional charge to policy obligation expense from unlocking was $6.1 million, compared with reduced expense of $1.4 million in 2007 and $1.1 million in 2006. The other factor is that the deferred acquisition cost asset with regard to variable annuities is also subject to the unlocking of assumptions. Because of the variable account balance decline, future revenues and profits on variable business would also be expected to decline. This unlocking of assumptions resulted in a net charge of $7.5 million in 2008, compared with charges of $2.3 million in 2007 and $.9 million in 2006. Without these unlocking adjustments, variable underwriting income would have been $5.7 million in 2008 (42% of revenue), compared with $8.7 million (45% of revenue) in 2007 and $9.9 million (46% of revenue) in 2006. The unamortized deferred acquisition cost balance was $42 million at December 31, 2008 compared with $53 million at year end 2007. If equity markets do not stabilize, we could see higher amortization of acquisition costs in the future. The variable annuity business is our only business where margins are significantly impacted by changes in equity markets.  

While the fixed annuity account balance has increased each year over the prior year, policy charges have remained steady and underwriting income has declined slightly each year. The stability in fixed annuity policy charges has resulted as the charges consist of surrender charges and are not based on account size. These charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods. A significant portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements, which can result in negative net policy obligations. However, this investment income spread has declined in each year, resulting in the decline in underwriting income.

Administrative expenses. Operating expenses are included in the Other and Corporate Segments and are classified into two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company. The following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2008.  

Operating Expenses Selected Information  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Insurance administrative expenses rose 3% in 2008, after a slight decline in 2007. As a percentage of premium, they rose to 5.8% in 2008, after having decreased from 5.6% in 2006 to 5.5% in 2007. The 2008 increase was primarily a result of higher salary expenses, pension costs, and other costs such as postage and property taxes. The 2008 increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses and Medicare Part D administrative expense. One factor in the higher 2007 legal expense was the affirmation of an earlier jury verdict in insurance claim litigation in the amount of $1.9 million. Medicare Part D administrative expenses were lower in both 2008 and 2007 than in 2006 because open enrollment remained in effect in 2006 until May 15, causing us to incur additional administrative expenses in that year. Open enrollments for the 2007 and 2008 plan years were closed on December 31 of the respective prior year. Salaries, particularly in 2007, were favorably impacted by the previously-mentioned changes to Liberty Nationals agent compensation system. While these changes resulted in reductions in agent salaries and related employee costs of approximately $2.8 million in 2007 compared with 2006, new initiatives have resulted in an increase in these costs in 2008 of approximately $1.6 million over 2007. Management believes that these salary reductions could be replaced by higher deferred acquisition costs going forward, however, as the compensation system changes emphasize a commission-based agent compensation system rather than salaries. Commissions on new product sales are deferred and amortized over the premium-paying life of the business. Management believes that pension cost will increase approximately $8 million in 2009, as a result of the impact that declining financial markets have had on pension funding.  

Parent company expense rose $640 thousand or 7% in 2008 and $2.0 million or 25% in 2007. Included in 2008 and 2007 expenses were charges in the amount of $2.9 million in 2008 and $1.6 million in 2007 for expenses incurred related to potential acquisition bids that were not successful.

As mentioned in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we settled litigation in prior periods relating to issues occurring many years ago, but incurred $2.5 million in legal costs in 2008 and $933 thousand in 2007. As previously noted, we do not consider the costs of settling litigation applicable to prior periods to be related to current insurance operations. Stock compensation expense rose in 2008 because 2008 was the first year after adoption of the accounting rule requiring the expensing of stock options where we had three years of annual employee grants being expensed (2005, 2006 and 2008). The 2004 employee grant was fully vested in 2005 (before adoption) and there was no grant in 2007. New restricted stock grants in each of the three years 2006 through 2008, which generally vest over five years, have also contributed to the increases in 2008 and 2007 stock compensation expense. Management believes that it is highly unlikely that stock compensation expense will increase materially in 2009 or over the near term. As stated in Note 13Business Segments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense, and therefore treats it as a Parent Company expense. As described in Note 3Investments under the caption Other-than-temporary impairments, we wrote down certain Company-occupied real estate because it met our criteria as described in that note for other-than-temporary impairment. As a result, we incurred a pretax charge of $2.1 million which is included in Operating expenses in the 2008 Consolidated Statement of Operations.  

Investments. We manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. It is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in Note 13Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs. We also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used $4.0 billion of cash flow to repurchase Torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. Share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest-bearing assets, but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding. In order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment.  

Excess Investment Income. The following table summarizes Torchmarks investment income and excess investment income.

Excess investment income increased $4 million or 1% in 2008 over the prior year. Excess investment income increased $5 million or 2% in 2007. On a per diluted share basis, 2008 excess investment income rose 10% to $3.71. Per share excess investment income increased 7% in 2007 and 3% in 2006.  

The largest component of excess investment income is net investment income, which rose 3.5% to $671 million in 2008. It increased 3.2% to $649 million in 2007 from $628 million in 2006. As presented in the following chart, the growth in net investment income in both periods was not as great as the growth in mean invested assets.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The lower growth in income is reflective of new investments that have been made in recent years at long-term yields lower than the portfolios average yield, resulting from the lower rates available in financial markets in those periods. However, as noted under the caption Investment Acquisitions below, we did acquire $1.1 billion in fixed maturities in 2008 yielding 25 basis points higher than the average portfolio yield for the first time in several years. In each year 2006 through 2008, new acquisitions were made at lower yields than the yields on securities disposed of, contributing to the lower growth in income relative to the portfolio growth. Another factor limiting the growth in net investment income relative to average assets in 2007 was the purchase of $256 million of tax-exempt municipal securities. Yields available on municipal bonds are lower, but produce significant tax savings to the Company. Also contributing to the lower growth in yields in recent years were calls on fixed maturity securities in the portfolio, as the yield on the reinvestment of the proceeds was below that of the called securities. Given the sizeable annual cash flow from our operations, we expect mean invested assets to continue to grow, but if rates available for new investments do not exceed our portfolio yield, the rate of growth of investment income will lag the growth in assets. More detailed information about investment acquisitions follows under the caption Investment Acquisitions.  

Excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt. Information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table.  

Interest Credited to Net Insurance Policy Liabilities  

(Dollar amounts in millions)

Index to Financial Statements 

The average interest crediting rate has risen in each of the last three years. In 2001, as part of our normal review of policy reserve assumptions, we increased the interest rate assumption 100 basis points (1%) on policies issued after January 1, 2001. As this group of policies becomes a larger proportion of our business, the average crediting rate will continue to increase. For more specific information on life and health crediting rates, please refer to Note 5Future Policy Benefit Reserves in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs. Financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income. The table below reconciles interest expense per the Consolidated Statements of Operations to financing costs.

The table below presents the components of financing costs.  

Analysis of Financing Costs  

(Amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Financing costs declined $4 million or 6% in 2008. They declined $5 million or 7% in 2007. The 2008 decline resulted from a decrease in short-term interest rates during 2008, as well as a 4% decline in our average commercial paper balance for the year to $229 million. The primary factor in the 2007 decrease was the refinancing in 2006 of two of our funded debt issues. Our 6¼% Senior Notes ($180 million principal amount) matured and our 7¾% Trust Preferred Securities ($150 million redemption value) were called in the fourth quarter of 2006. These repayments were essentially funded by the issuance of two new instruments in the second quarter of 2006, our 6 3/8% Senior Notes ($250 million principal amount) and our 7.1% Trust Preferred Securities ($120 million principal amount). Because the new issues were offered several months before the other securities were repaid, interest on funded debt increased $11 million. It should be noted, however, that we invested the proceeds of the new offerings and the investment income from those proceeds offset the increased financing costs, having little impact on excess investment income. Partially offsetting the decline in interest on funded debt in 2007 was an increase in interest on short-term debt. While higher short-term rates were a factor, the primary cause of the increase was a higher average balance of our commercial paper outstanding in 2007, which rose 43% to $238 million.

Index to Financial Statements 

Prior to 2006, we entered into several interest-rate swap agreements, in which we exchanged our fixed-interest commitments for floating-rate commitments. In the low-interest environment experienced in the past several years, these swaps provided us with a considerable spread between our actual interest cost and what our fixed interest cost would have been. However, as rates began to rise in 2005 and 2006, we began to dispose of these instruments in 2005 and had disposed of all remaining swap instruments as of the second quarter of 2006. The benefit of the swaps in 2006 reduced our financing costs in that year by $491 thousand. More information concerning the debt offerings, repayments, and swaps is disclosed in Note 10Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Excess investment income benefits from increases in long-term rates available on new investments and decreases in short-term borrowing rates. Of these two factors, higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short-term rates.  

Investment Acquisitions. Torchmarks current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investment-grade fixed maturities with long maturities (maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date) that meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. We believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows are generally stable and predictable. If such longer-term securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives, new money is invested short-term, with maturities less than five years. During calendar years 2006 through 2008, Torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities, primarily corporate securities. There were no below investment grade securities acquired. Investment-grade corporate securities include both bonds and trust-preferred securities (which are classified as redeemable preferred stocks) with a diversity of issuers and industry sectors.

The following table summarizes selected information for fixed-maturity purchases. The effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield. This date is commonly known as the worst call date. For noncallable bonds, the worst call date is always the maturity date. For callable bonds, the worst call date is the call date that produces the lowest yield (or the maturity date, if the yield calculated to the maturity date is lower than the yield calculated to each call date). Two different average life calculations are shown, average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date.  

Fixed Maturity Acquisitions Selected Information  

(Dollar amounts in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable (on other than a make-whole basis) prior to maturity. We periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so. For investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether or not (and if so, when) the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment. We do know that the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart.  

Prior to 2007, we generally did not invest in securities with maturity dates more than 30 years after the acquisition date. Because of the changing investment environment during 2007 and 2008, we invested some funds in fixed-maturity securities (bonds, trust preferred securities and redeemable preferred stocks) with longer scheduled maturity dates. In virtually all cases, such securities have a scheduled maturity date and are callable many years prior to the scheduled maturity date. Due primarily to this increase in these longer-term securities, the average life of funds invested during 2007 and 2008 (to both next call and maturity) is significantly higher than that of investments during 2006.  

New cash flow available to us for investment has been affected by issuer calls as a result of the low-interest environment experienced during the past three years. Issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost. Calls increase funds available for investment, but they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called. Issuer calls were $238 million in 2008, $848 million in 2007, and $229 million in 2006. The 2007 level of calls was unusual, and contributed to the significant increase in funds invested in that year.

Portfolio Analysis. Because Torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities, the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms. The following table presents a comparison of Torchmarks components of invested assets at amortized cost as of December 31, 2008 with the latest industry data.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2008, approximately 94% of our investments at book value were in a diversified fixed-maturity portfolio. Policy loans, which are secured by policy cash values, made up an additional 4%. The remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities, mortgage loans, and other long-term and short-term investments.  

Because fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio, the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities. At December 31, 2008, fixed maturities had a fair value of $7.8 billion, compared with $9.2 billion at December 31, 2007. Net unrealized losses on fixed maturities increased from $103 million at December 31, 2007 to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2008. More than $1 billion of the increase in net unrealized loss during 2008 was attributable to securities for which there was no downgrade in the Bloomberg Composite Rating. Approximately $300 million of the increase was attributable to securities for which there was a one-step downgrade in the Bloomberg Composite Rating. More than $800 million of the increase was attributable to securities issued by banks and insurance companies. As discussed in Note 3Investments under the caption Fair value measurements, we believe, based on what we have observed in the market, that much of the increase in unrealized losses was attributable to illiquidity in the markets. This illiquidity has contributed to a spread widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable. Torchmark has the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery. An analysis of our fixed-maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2008 is as follows:

Approximately 80% of our fixed maturity assets at December 31, 2008 were corporate bonds and 13% were redeemable preferred stocks. Less than 1% of the assets were residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). All of the mortgage-backed securities were rated AAA. The average rating of our CDOs was A-, with none rated less than BBB. Unless otherwise indicated, our security ratings are based on the Bloomberg Composite Rating, a blend of ratings of securities from four prominent rating agencies.  

At the end of 2008 and 2007, the fixed-maturity portfolio had a gross unrealized gain of $126 million and $247 million, respectively. Gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities were $1.9 billion at December 31, 2008, compared with $350 million a year earlier. For further analysis of our fixed-maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2008 and 2007, an analysis of unrealized investment losses, and a schedule of maturities, see Note 3Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Additional information concerning the fixed-maturity portfolio is as follows.

Credit Risk Sensitivity. Credit risk is the level of certainty that a securitys issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity. Approximately 94% of our fixed-maturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities (including redeemable preferred and asset-backed securities). As we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities, credit risk is a concern. We mitigate this ongoing risk, in part, by acquiring investment-grade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer. We continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis. We also seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a large number of issuers over a wide range of industry sectors.  

The following table presents the relative percentage of our corporate fixed maturities by industry sector at December 31, 2008.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2008, approximately 37% of the fixed maturity assets at fair value were in the financial sector, including 16% in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 17% in banks. Financial guarantors and mortgage insurers comprised approximately 1% of the portfolio. After financials, the next largest sector was utilities, which comprised 13% of the portfolio. The balance of the portfolio is spread among 246 issuers in a wide variety of sectors.  

Gross unrealized losses were $1.9 billion. As previously noted, based upon what we have observed in the market, management believes that much of the unrealized loss at December 31, 2008 was attributable to illiquidity in the market, contributing to a spread widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable. Torchmark has the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery. Approximately 54% of the gross unrealized losses were attributable to the financial sector, including 27% attributable to life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 17% attributable to banks. We are encouraged by the efforts of the Federal government to help banks and insurance companies to weather the current financial crisis, but the Company cannot predict at this time what impact these efforts will have on ultimate recovery.

At December 31, 2008  

(Dollar amounts in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of BBB+ based on amortized cost. Approximately 93% of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade. Our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages (loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower). We have no direct investments in residential mortgages, nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts. We do not participate in securities lending. There are no off-balance sheet investments, as all investments are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2008, we had $14 million at fair value ($131 million book value) invested in CDOs, for which the Bloomberg Composite Rating at that date was A-. The collateral underlying these CDOs is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies, but no sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages are included in the collateral.  

Our current investment policy is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. Thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings.  

Subsequent Data as of February 12, 2009. The gross unrealized loss on fixed maturity assets at February 12, 2009 was $2.0 billion, an increase of $95 million or 5% since December 31, 2008. The decline in fair value of fixed maturities in the Financial - Bank sector accounted for $109 million of the increase in gross unrealized loss.

Market Risk Sensitivity. Torchmarks financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the companys investment portfolio. Since 94% of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed-maturity investments (and virtually all of these investments are fixed-rate investments), the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. Declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value. Under normal market conditions, we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity. The long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. The increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. However, in accordance with GAAP, these liabilities are not marked to market.  

The following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest-rate sensitive fixed-maturity portfolio at December 31, 2008 and 2007. This table measures the effect of a change in interest rates (as represented by the U.S. Treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio. The data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Realized Gains and Losses. Our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. In addition to the payment of these benefits, we also incur acquisition costs, administrative expenses, and taxes as a part of insurance operations. Because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.  

Because our investment portfolio is large and diverse, investments are occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains and losses occur only incidentally, usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. Investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments. We do not engage in trading investments for profit. Therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield, or which result from events that are beyond our control, are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders.  

Realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the period-to-period trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.

As described in Note 3Investments under the caption Other-than temporary impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we wrote certain securities down to fair value during 2008 as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. The impaired securities met our criteria for other-than-temporary impairment as discussed in Note 3 and in our Critical Accounting Policies in this report. The writedown resulted in a 2008 pretax charge of $106 million ($69 million after tax). Of this pre-tax amount, $94 million consisted of bonds of Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual and perpetual preferred stock of Federal National Mortgage Association as shown in the table below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Due to the current status of these entities, we expect our future net investment income to be reduced by approximately $7 million per year. Additionally in 2008, securities of certain non-financial institutions were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired and were written down $12 million ($8 million after tax). We also wrote down a real estate investment to fair value in 2008, resulting in a loss of $1.1 million ($718 thousand after tax).  

In 2007, we wrote down certain non-financial institution holdings because of other-than-temporary impairment. The pretax charge for this impairment was $11 million ($7 million after tax). At the time of impairment, these securities were carried at a value of $48 million. Since the writedown, a portion of these securities were sold for proceeds of $19 million in 2007 and the remainder was sold in 2008 for proceeds of $15 million.

As discussed in Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we redeemed our 7¾% Trust Preferred Securities in 2006, recording a pretax loss of $5.5 million ($3.6 million after tax). Additionally in 2006, we repurchased with the intent to retire $3.3 million principal amount of our 7 7/8% Notes, recording a pretax loss of $415 thousand ($270 thousand after tax).  

In years prior to 2007, we entered into interest-rate swap agreements, swapping our fixed-rate commitments on our long-term debt for floating-rate commitments. Accounting rules required us to value our interest-rate swaps at their fair value at the end of each accounting period, and we recorded changes as a component of Realized investment gains (losses). During the first half of 2006, we sold all remaining swap instruments, so that no swaps were held after June, 2006. More information on our swaps, including the accounting policies, is found in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies and in Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  

Liquidity. Liquidity provides Torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations. Our liquidity is derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, and a line of credit facility.  

The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes.  

Cash inflows from insurance operations significantly exceed cash outflows primarily because life insurers, such as Torchmark, expect to pay the majority of their policyholder benefits in future periods, sometimes many years later. An actuarially computed reserve is carried in the financial statements for these future benefits. Earnings are charged for the increase in this reserve each period, but there is no corresponding cash outlay. Therefore, cash provided from operations is generally expected to exceed net income. Cash flows are also generated by the maturities and scheduled repayments of the investment portfolio. Cash flows in excess of immediate requirements are invested to fund future requirements. Available cash flows are also used to repay debt, to buy back Torchmark shares, to pay shareholder dividends, and for other corporate uses. As discussed below under the caption Parent Company Liquidity, the primary source of the cash flows for these purposes is dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries to the parent company.  

Cash flows provided from operations were $731 million in 2008, $850 million in 2007, and $865 million in 2006. In addition, we received $581 million in investment maturities, repayments, and calls in 2008, adding to available cash flows. Such repayments were $1.3 billion in 2007 and $606 million in 2006.  

Our cash and short-term investments were $177 million at year-end 2008 and $131 million at year-end 2007. Additionally, we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. These securities had a fair value of $7.8 billion at December 31, 2008. However, our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.  

Parent Company Liquidity. An important source of cash flow to the parent company is dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries. As allowed by insurance regulations, the insurance subsidiaries generally pay dividends to Torchmark Parent in amounts equal to their prior year earnings calculated on a statutory basis. These dividends are received in order to meet the Parent Companys dividend payments on common and preferred stock, interest and principal repayment requirements on debt of the Parent Company, and operating expenses of the Parent. In 2008, $404 million in dividends were paid to the Parent Company, as compared with $458 million in 2007 and $428 million in 2006. After paying debt obligations, shareholder dividends, and other expenses (but before share repurchases), Torchmark Parent had excess operating cash flow in 2008 of approximately $343 million. Parent Company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes, such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases. In 2009, it is expected that the Parent Company will receive $348 million in dividends from subsidiaries and that a range of $320 million to $330 million will be available as excess cash flow, assuming that our Senior Debt due in August, 2009 is refinanced. Certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends. For more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the restrictions section of Note 11Shareholders Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has substantially exceeded the cash flow needs for parent company operations.  

Torchmark qualifies for and is participating in the Commercial Paper Funding Facility (CPFF), a facility created by the Federal Reserve Board to purchase commercial paper from eligible issuers. Torchmark can issue $305 million under the CPFF, which was the par amount outstanding at December 31, 2008 (book value $304 million).  

Capital in our insurance subsidiaries is sufficient to support current operations. As of December 31, 2008, the ratio of regulatory capital to Company Action Level required capital was 329%, in line with recent years.

An additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $600 million. As of December 31, 2008, we had available $95 million on this facility. For a detailed discussion of this line of credit facility, see the Commercial Paper section of Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As fully described and discussed in Note 10Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and under the subcaption Funded Debt, Torchmark had outstanding $120 million (par amount) 7.1% Trust Preferred Securities at both December 31, 2008 and 2007. The capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders. The trust is an off-balance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with GAAP rules. Deconsolidation is required because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest. Therefore Torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity, even though we own all of the entitys voting equity and have guaranteed the entitys performance. While these liabilities are not on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, they are represented by Torchmarks 7.1% Junior Subordinated Debentures due to the trust. These Junior Subordinated Debentures were a Torchmark liability of $124 million par and book value at both December 31, 2008 and 2007. These securities are indicated as a capital resource to us under the caption Capital Resources in this report. The 7.1% preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our 7.1% interest payment on our debt to the trusts. As described in Note 14Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the Trust Preferred shareholders.  

As of December 31, 2008, we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third-party entities other than as described above. All of our guarantees, other than the Trust Preferred guarantee, were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries, as disclosed in Note 14Commitments and Contingencies.  

The following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of December 31, 2008.

 (2) Interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (5) Future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force and separate account obligations at December 31, 2008. These estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. The actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown. Management believes that the assets supporting the liability of $9 billion at December 31, 2008, along with future premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations.

Capital Resources. Torchmarks capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility described in Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), long-term funded debt, Junior Subordinated Debentures supporting its Trust Preferred Securities, and shareholders equity. The Junior Subordinated Debentures are payable to Torchmarks Capital Trust III which is liable for its Trust Preferred Securities. In accordance with GAAP, these instruments are included in Due to affiliates on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A complete analysis and description of long-term debt issues outstanding is presented in Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The carrying value of the funded debt was $722 million at December 31, 2008, the same as a year earlier. Our 8.25% Senior Debentures are due in August, 2009 at a redemption amount of $99.5 million plus accrued interest, and are classified as short-term debt because they are due within a year. As a result, reported long-term debt at December 31, 2008 was $499 million. If conditions in financial markets stabilize, we intend to refinance this debt with another issue. Otherwise, we intend to repay the debt with our excess cash flow.  

During the second quarter of 2006, we registered and issued two new security offerings: our 7.1% Trust Preferred Securities, offered through Torchmark Capital Trust III at a redemption value of $120 million less issue expenses, and our 6 3/8% Senior Notes issued for the principal amount of $250 million less issue expenses. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we redeemed our 7 3/4% Trust Preferred Securities and we repaid our 6 1/4% Senior Notes which matured. The Trust Preferred Securities were redeemed for $150 million plus accrued dividends and our Senior Notes were repaid in the principal amount of $180 million plus accrued interest. Specific information about the new securities offered and the securities repaid in 2006, including the uses of proceeds and sources of funding, is disclosed and discussed in Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Over the past several years, we have entered into swap agreements to exchange the fixed-rate commitments on our funded debt for floating-rate commitments. During the low interest-rate environment in recent years, these swaps were very beneficial in reducing our interest cost. However, as short-term rates rose in 2006 with no meaningful change in long-term rates, these swaps became less profitable. Because we believed that the swap settlements could have possibly become unprofitable, we disposed of our two remaining swap agreements during 2006 and held no swap agreements after June 2006. More information about our swaps is found in Note 10Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Interest Rate Swaps.  

We believe that the most beneficial use of our excess cash flow could be a strategic acquisition. However, an acquisition is unlikely until financial markets stabilize. Absent an acquisition, we believe that the best use of excess cash is to buy Company stock. However, we will exercise caution given current economic conditions. We will not jeopardize our liquidity or debt covenants through our share repurchase program. As previously mentioned, our Board reaffirmed its continued authorization of the stock repurchase program in October, 2008 in amounts and timing that management, in consultation with the Board, determined to be in the best interest of the Company. We have repurchased common stock every year since 1986, except for 1995, the year following the acquisition of American Income. Since the beginning of 1998, we have repurchased 60 million shares at a total cost of $2.7 billion, and have acquired no fewer than 3.4 million shares in any one year. We believe that Torchmark share purchases at favorable prices add incrementally to per share earnings and to return on equity, and are an excellent way to increase total shareholder value. As noted earlier in this report, we acquired over 7.6 million shares at a cost of $427 million in 2008 with excess cash flow. If the free cash flow used for the repurchase of our common stock had alternatively been invested in corporate bonds, an estimated $11 million of additional investment income, after tax, would have resulted and net income per diluted share would have declined 9% to $4.99. Because share purchases were made, actual net income per share was $5.11, a lesser decline of 7%. We intend to continue the repurchase of our common shares when conditions are favorable. The majority of purchased shares are retired each year.

We maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed-maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders liabilities. Accounting rule (SFAS 115) requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets. While SFAS 115 requires invested assets to be revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner. Due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders equity. If these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets, the effect on equity would be largely offset. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. For this reason, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of SFAS 115 when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.  

The following tables present selected data related to our capital resources. Additionally, the tables present the effect of SFAS 115 on relevant line items, so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on Torchmarks capital structure.

 *** Torchmarks debt covenants require that the effect of SFAS 115 be removed to determine this ratio.  

Effective in 2008, the FASB issued a new Statement SFAS 159, offering an option which, if elected, would permit us to value our interest-bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our available-for-sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income, the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings. Because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt, the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile, causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results. Therefore, we do not intend to elect this option.  

As discussed earlier in this report, the fixed maturity portfolio incurred $1.8 million in net unrealized investment losses in 2008 ($1.1 million after tax and adjustments of deferred acquisition costs). These unrealized losses are believed by management to have been brought on by widening credit spreads in financial markets, and were the primary factor in the decline in our shareholders equity in 2008. Share purchases in each of the years 2006 through 2008 were generally offset by net income, having little impact on our total shareholders equity in those periods. Torchmarks ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements (times interest earned) was 11.5 times in 2008, compared with 12.8 times in 2007 and 11.6 times in 2006. A discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption Investments in this report.

Credit Ratings. The credit quality of Torchmarks debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies. In 2008, Standard & Poors affirmed all credit ratings on Torchmark and its subsidiaries. However, it revised its outlook to negative from stable for the Company. Standard & Poors cited our increased risk within our investment portfolio which has experienced significant unrealized losses concentrated in the financial sector. They also noted that our share repurchase program has reduced our capitalization, but that we were still well within a level adequate to support their rating. Fitch also revised its outlook to negative during 2008. During 2007, Standard & Poors lowered its credit rating on Torchmarks outstanding debt from A+ to A, and lowered the rating of its preferred stock from A- to BBB+. The credit rating change was attributed to weaker agent productivity, recruiting, and retention, as well as changes in direct response strategy, all of which have contributed to lower new sales. During 2006, A.M. Best downgraded Torchmarks funded debt one notch from a to a-, and its preferred stock from a- to bbb+. Moodys downgraded our funded debt from A3 to Baa1, and our preferred stock from Baa1 to Baa2. Both downgrades were to reflect the notching, or widening of rating levels between the insurance companies and their parent company which has issued the debt. This notching is typical for these rating agencies as they rate other insurance companies. It does not reflect any change in the creditworthiness of the Company. The chart below presents Torchmarks credit ratings as of December 31, 2008.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries are also rated by Standard & Poors and A.M. Best. In 2007, Standard & Poors lowered its financial strength rating of United Investors to A from A+ and the ratings of Liberty, Globe, United American and American Income from AA to AA-, as a result of an expected lag in new business sales in the short term. In 2006, A. M. Best lowered its financial strength rating of United Investors to A (Excellent) from A+ (Superior), as a result of Torchmarks diminished emphasis of that subsidiarys business. The following chart presents these ratings for our five largest insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2008.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

A.M. Best states that it assigns A+ (Superior) ratings to those companies which, in its opinion, have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the life/health insurance industry. A+ (Superior) companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time. The A.M. Best A (Excellent) rating is assigned to those companies which, in its opinion, have demonstrated excellent overall performance when compared to the norms of the life/health insurance industry. A (Excellent) companies have an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time.  

The AA financial strength rating category is assigned by Standard & Poors Corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics, differing only slightly from those rated higher. The minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category. The A rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics, somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES  

Information regarding related party transactions is found in Note 15Related Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

OTHER ITEMS  

Litigation. Torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries. Such punitive damage claims that are tried in Alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in Alabama are based upon the compensatory damages (including mental anguish) awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined. Additionally, it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the State of Mississippi, a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts. This bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material. For more information concerning litigation, please refer to Note 14Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

NEW UNADOPTED ACCOUNTING RULES  

The FASB has issued certain new standards potentially applicable to Torchmark, effective in future periods:  

Business Combinations: Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS 141R), replaces the previous accounting guidance for the acquisition of other companies. It retains the purchase method of accounting and the current guidance with respect to the accounting for indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill. However, the new Statement provides certain significant differences, most notably that all assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) are measured at their fair value as of the acquisition date rather than a cost allocation approach as previously required. Additionally, all expenses of the acquisition are charged off as incurred rather than capitalized. This Statement is effective for Torchmark as of January 1, 2009 in the event there is an acquisition dated subsequent to that date.  

Noncontrolling Interests: Statement No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements - an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS 160), changes the accounting for noncontrolling interests (also known as minority interests). At this time, Torchmark has no noncontrolling interests.  

Derivatives: Statement No. 161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activitiesan amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161), was issued in March, 2008 expanding the disclosures about derivatives and hedging activities required under existing accounting guidance. SFAS 161 is effective for Torchmark as of January 1, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, Torchmark does not hold any of the derivative instruments subject to this Statement.  

Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts: Statement No. 163, Accounting for Financial Guarantee Insurance Contractsan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 60 (SFAS 163) was issued in May, 2008 to clarify accounting for such instruments. Torchmark does not offer this form of insurance and therefore this Statement will not apply to us.  

Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets: The FASB issued in December, 2008 FASB Staff Position 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP 132(R)-1). This document requires additional disclosures about plan assets, such as more detail information on asset categories, investment strategies, concentrations of credit risks, and valuation techniques. The valuation information is similar to the disclosures in SFAS 157 for Company investments. FSP 132(R)-1 also requires a discussion of the basis for the determination of the expected long-term-rate-of-return assumption. It is effective for annual periods for Torchmark beginning in 2009.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Future Policy Benefits. Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. The liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry. The accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in Note 5Future Policy Benefit Reserves.  

Approximately 73% of our liabilities for future policy benefits at December 31, 2008 are accounted for under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 60, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises (SFAS 60), under which the liability is the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits. The assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue. Under SFAS 60, these assumptions are locked in and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts, except where there is a premium deficiency, as defined in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Future Policy Benefits. Otherwise, variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies. A premium deficiency event for Torchmarks SFAS 60 business is very rare, and did not occur during the three years ended December 31, 2008.  

The remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business reported under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 97, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments (SFAS 97). Under SFAS 97, the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date. Accordingly, there are no assumptions used in the determination of the SFAS 97 future policy benefit liability.  

Deferred Acquisition Costs and Value of Insurance Purchased. The costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales. Additionally, the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption Value of Insurance Purchased as indicated in Note 4Deferred Acquisition Costs and Value of Insurance Purchased in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Approximately 95% of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at December 31, 2008 are accounted for under the provisions of SFAS 60 for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums. The projection assumptions for SFAS 60 business are set at the time of contract issue. Under SFAS 60, these assumptions are locked-in at that time and, except where there is a loss recognition issue, are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts. Absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume. We have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for our SFAS 60 assets for any period in the three years ended December 31, 2008.  

The remaining portion of deferred acquisition costs pertain to business reported under SFAS 97 for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits. These contracts are not subject to lock-in. Under SFAS 97, the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. With the exception of variable annuities, as discussed earlier in this report, revisions related to our SFAS 97 assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended December 31, 2008. The variable annuity block could sustain further increases in the level of amortization if equity markets do not stabilize. Amortization for SFAS 97 blocks other than variable annuities is not expected to have a material impact on operations for the foreseeable future.  

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable. This liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimate of unreported

 claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. However, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. Factors involved include medical trend rates and medical cost inflation, the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established. Changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. We believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate under the circumstances. However, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. At this time, we do not expect any change in estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience.  

Revenue Recognition. Premium income from our subsidiaries insurance contracts is generally recognized as the premium is collected. However, in accordance with GAAP, revenues on limited-payment contracts and universal life-type contracts (deposit balance products) are recognized differently. Revenues on limited-payment contracts are recognized over the contract period. Premium for deposit balance products, such as our annuity and interest-sensitive life policies, is added to the policy account value. The policy account value (or deposit balance) is a Torchmark liability. This deposit balance is then charged a fee for the cost of insurance, administration, surrender, and certain other charges which are recognized as revenue in the period the fees are charged to the policyholder. In each case, benefits and expenses are matched with revenues in a manner by which they are incurred as the revenues are earned.  

We report investment income as revenue, less investment expenses, when it is earned. Our investment activities are integral to our insurance operations. Because life and health insurance claims and benefits may not be paid until many years into the future, the accumulation of cash flows from premium receipts are invested. Anticipated yields earned on investments are reflected in premium rates, contract liabilities, and other product contract features. These yield assumptions are implied in the interest required on our net insurance liabilities (future policy benefits less deferred acquisition costs) and contractual interest obligations in our insurance and annuity products. For more information concerning revenue recognition, investment accounting, and interest sensitivity, please refer to Note 1Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and discussions under the captions Annuities, Investments, and Market Risk Sensitivity in this report.  

Valuation of Fixed Maturities: We hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. While these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time, primarily to maintain our investment quality and diversification standards. We report this portfolio at fair value. Fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets, having a greater impact on longer-term maturities. Because of the size of our fixed-maturity portfolio, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the Company. This impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption Market Risk Sensitivity in this report. However, as discussed under the caption Financial Condition in this report, we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.  

During 2008, the values of our fixed maturities have also been affected by illiquidity in the financial markets, which has contributed to a spread widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable. Even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. Considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed-maturity investments are presented in Note 3Investments under the caption Fair Value Measurements.  

Impairment of Investments. We continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value, where fair value has declined below carrying value. While the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary. The policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for

 impairments of investments are disclosed in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies and Note 3Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussions under the captions Investments and Realized Gains and Losses in this report. While every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.  

Defined benefit pension plans. We maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. We also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees. Our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. In accordance with GAAP, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. These obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. At December 31, 2008, our net liability under these plans was $56 million.  

The actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. These assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. A decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation. A decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. Small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans. While we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions, given the information available from company experience, economic data, independent consultants and other sources, we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected. Our discount rate, rate of return on assets, and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in Note 9Postretirement Benefits in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The assumptions are reviewed annually and revised, if necessary, based on more current information available to us. Note 9 also contains information about pension plan assets, investment policies, and other related data.
