Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and Torchmarks Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Discontinued Operations: As described in Note 3Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we sold our subsidiary United Investors Life Insurance Company (United Investors) as of December 31, 2010. Because of the sale, United Investors financial results are excluded from this discussion since those operations are discontinued.  

How Torchmark Views Its Operations: Torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance, and to a limited extent annuities, to middle income households throughout the United States. We view our operations by segments, which are the major insurance product lines of life, health, and annuities, and the investment segment that supports the product lines. Segments are aligned based on their common characteristics, comparability of the profit margins, and management techniques used to operate each segment.  

Insurance Product Line Segments. As fully described in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the product line segments involve the marketing, underwriting, and benefit administration of policies. Each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies. Each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market. Whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole, or the individual distribution units within the segment, the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin, which is:  

Premium revenue  

Less:  

 Policy obligations  

 Policy acquisition costs and commissions  

Investment Segment. The investment segment involves the management of our capital resources, including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity. Our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income, which is:  

Net investment income  

Less:  

 Interest credited to net policy liabilities  

 Financing costs  

The tables in Note 14Business Segments reconcile Torchmarks revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three-year period ending December 31, 2010. Additionally, this Note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year-to-year comparability and which reconciles to net income. That summary is reproduced below from the Consolidated Financial Statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business.

Torchmarks operations on a segment-by-segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report.  

Summary of Operations: Net income rose 28% or $112 million in 2010 to $517 million. In 2009, net income declined $47 million or 10% to $405 million from $452 million. On a diluted per share basis, 2010 net income increased 29% to $6.30. In 2009, per share net income declined 5% to $4.88. Included in 2010 results is the $35 million after tax loss on the disposal of United Investors, representing $.43 per diluted share.  

The major contributor to the growth in 2010 earnings compared with the previous two years was in realized investment gains and losses, as 2010 had net gains of $24 million compared with net losses of $85 million in 2009 and $70 million in 2008. The losses in 2009 and 2008 included a number of writedowns of fixed-maturity securities that were determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired. In 2009, after-tax realized investment losses reduced per share earnings $1.03, of which $1.13 per share related to other-than-temporary impairments of fixed maturities. In 2008, after-tax losses accounted for $.79 per share, of which $.78 related to fixed maturity other-than-temporary impairments. In 2010, we had realized investment gains which added $.30 to per diluted share earnings, even though there was an other-than-temporary impairment writedown of $.04 per share that offset the net gains for the period. Another important factor in 2010 earnings growth was a $21 million or 8% growth in our excess investment income, the measure of profitability of our investment segment. In 2009, excess investment income declined $28 million or 9%. Poor economic conditions in 2009, especially early in the year, caused us to hold a significant portion in low-yielding cash and short-term investments for increased liquidity. Excess investment income was also negatively affected in 2009 because of our issuance of a $300 million 9 1/4% debt security in June, 2009 (net proceeds of $296 million) and repayment of a $99 million 8 1/4% security which matured in August, 2009. These transactions resulted in a net increase in our financing costs in 2009 and reduced excess investment income. Results in our core life insurance segment rose 7% in 2010 to $455 million and also increased 3% in 2009, largely as a result of premium growth in both years. The life segment is our largest contributor to operating results. Earnings from our health operations stabilized in 2010 after two years of declines. This segment has experienced intense competition in recent periods resulting in significant declines in agent counts, which in turn has resulted in  

19

Index to Financial Statements 

 lower sales of new health products. Health underwriting margins were flat at $170 million in 2010 after having declined $24 million or 12% in 2009.  

Total revenues increased 8% in 2010 to $3.37 billion. In 2009, total revenues declined 3% to $3.12 billion from $3.20 billion in 2008. Life premium rose 5% or $72 million in 2010 and $48 million in 2009. Net investment income rose $44 million in 2010, compared with $5 million in 2009. However, growth in revenues in 2009 and 2008 were negatively affected by the aforementioned pretax realized investment losses and declines in health premium, described further under this caption.  

While life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending December 31, 2010, margins as a percentage of premium have also held steady each year at 27% of premium. Life net sales rose 1% in 2010 to $330 million and 10% in 2009 to $326 million. Life insurance segment results are discussed further under the caption Life Insurance.  

We market three primary health insurance products: Medicare Supplement insurance, the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, and under-age-65 limited-benefit health insurance. Health premium declined 3% in 2010 to $987 million from $1.02 billion in 2009. Health premium declined 10% in 2009. The decreases in both years were caused by the decline in agent count and poor persistency. Agent turnover has increased as lower premium, lower margin products offered by competitors have provided agents with products that are easier to sell. Turnover has also increased due to the Companys decision to deemphasize the marketing of certain limited-benefit products. Sales of these de-emphasized products were discontinued altogether after September, 2010. Declines in these agent counts have resulted in lower net sales, which in turn have pressured premium growth. Medicare Supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium, but increased competition has also dampened sales of this product in recent years, resulting in premium declines in each successive year. Our Medicare Part D premium rose 14% in 2010, after having increased 5% in 2009. However, as most of the countrys Part D enrollees selected a plan provider in 2006, we do not expect significant growth in our Part D business going forward. See the discussion under Health Insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results.  

We offer fixed annuities, but we do not emphasize sales of annuity products, favoring life insurance instead. With the sale of United Investors, we disposed of 37% of our annuity deposit balance. See the caption Annuities for further discussion of the Annuity segment.  

As previously mentioned, the investment segments pretax profitability, or excess investment income, increased $21 million in 2010 but declined $28 million in 2009. Profitability in this segment is based on three major components: net investment income, required interest on net policy liabilities (interest applicable to insurance products), and financing costs. In recent years, growth in net investment income has been restricted in relation to the growth in the size of our portfolio. However, in 2010, the growth in net investment income exceeded the growth in the average portfolio (amortized cost) for the first time in many years, primarily as a result of the special constraints on the growth in net investment income in 2009 noted below. One reason that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of. Also, there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested, in which the funds are held in cash. Growth in total investment income has also been somewhat negatively affected by Torchmarks share repurchase program (described later under this caption), which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments. During 2009, due primarily to uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets, we held significantly more cash and short term investments than we normally would. Additionally, in 2009, we sold a significant portion of higher-yielding but lower-rated fixed maturities and reinvested the proceeds in lower-yielding but higher-rated bonds in 2009 and early 2010 to improve our risk-adjusted return. These factors contributed to reduced 2009 net investment income.  

The interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income, and generally grows in conjunction with the insurance policy reserves that are supported by the invested assets. Financing costs, which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short-term debt, are also deducted from net investment income. In 2010, interest expense on our long-term debt rose $9 million after increasing $11 million in 2009. As noted earlier during 2009, we issued our $300 million 9 1/4% Senior Notes but repaid our $99 million 8 1/4% Senior Debentures, resulting in a higher balance of debt outstanding at a  

20  

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

 higher interest rate. However, this segment has benefited from lower short-term financing costs in each successive year, as these costs have declined primarily due to lower rates on our short-term debt.  

Torchmarks current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investment-grade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities (often exceeding twenty years) that meet our quality and yield objectives. Approximately 94% of our invested assets at fair value consists of fixed maturities of which 93% was investment grade at December 31, 2010. The average quality rating of the portfolio was BBB+. The portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or Alt-A mortgages, no direct investment in residential mortgages, no counterparty risks, no credit default swaps, or derivative contracts. See the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption Investments in this report and Note 4Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Statements of Operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment.  

As described earlier in this summary, we wrote down certain fixed maturity and equity securities in each of the years 2008 through 2010, as these securities met our criteria for other-than-temporary impairment. The pretax impairment losses were $5 million, $143 million, and $106 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Please refer to Note 4Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Other-than-temporary impairments and under the caption Realized Gains and Losses in this report for more information on these writedowns and our criteria for consideration of other-than-temporary impairment. Including the writedowns, we had total after-tax realized investment gains of $24 million in 2010 ($.30 per share), realized investment losses of $85 million in 2009 ($1.03 per share), and $70 million in 2008 ($.79 per share). Realized investment gains and losses can vary significantly from period to period and may have a material positive or negative impact on net income. Under the caption Realized Gains and Losses in this report, we present a complete analysis and discussion of our realized gains and losses including the writedowns. Also, as explained in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments.  

As mentioned earlier, we used a portion of the $296 million proceeds from the offering of our 9 1/4% Senior Notes ($300 million par amount) in 2009 to repay our $99 million 8 1/4% Senior Debentures which also matured in 2009. In addition, we also used $175 million to strengthen the capital position of certain of our insurance subsidiaries in 2009 in the form of capital contributions and surplus notes. The regulatory capital positions of these subsidiaries had been negatively affected by rating-agency downgrades of bonds in their investment portfolios. The subsidiaries in turn invested these funds in investment-grade fixed maturities. More information on these transactions can be found in Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in our discussion of Capital Resources in this report.  

In each of the years 2008 and 2009, income from continuing operations was affected by certain significant, unusual, and nonrecurring nonoperating items. We do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations. A discussion of these items follows.  

As reported in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Litigation and Tax Settlements, we have been involved in certain litigation issues in 2008 and 2009 in which we either received settlements net of expenses or incurred settlement losses and expenses. These issues resulted in a net after-tax charge of $770 thousand in 2008. Additionally, as described under the same caption of Note 1, we received tax settlements in each year in the amounts of $2.9 million in 2009 and $10.8 million in 2008. All of these litigation and tax issues pertained to issues arising many years ago and are not considered by management to relate to our current operations. Legal and litigation expenses pertaining to current operations are included in either insurance administrative expenses or parent expenses, as appropriate, in our segment analysis. Income from litigation settlements is included in other income. As explained in Note 4Investments under the caption Other-than-temporary impairments, we wrote down certain company-occupied property to fair value during both 2009 and 2008. The write downs resulted in after-tax charges of $231 thousand in 2009 and $1.4 million in 2008.  

Torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in 1986. With no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the Companys excess cash flow, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. The majority of these  

21  

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

 purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable. Additionally, when stock options are exercised, proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises. Due to economic conditions in late 2008 and early 2009, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in the first quarter of 2009. However, in the first quarter of 2010, the Board of Directors reactivated the Companys previously suspended share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management, in consultation with the Board, determines to be in the best interest of the Company. The following chart summarizes share purchase activity for each of the three years ended December 31, 2010.

Throughout the remainder of this discussion, share purchases refer only to those made from excess cash flow and borrowings.  

A discussion of each of Torchmarks segments follows.  

Life Insurance. Life insurance is our largest insurance segment, with 2010 life premium representing 63% of total premium. Life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented 73% of the total in 2010. Additionally, investments supporting the reserves for life products result in the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment.  

We have been in the process of combining selected United American (UA) Exclusive Agency Branch Offices with the Liberty National Exclusive Agency. For this reason, all data will be reported on a combined basis in this report.  

Life insurance premium rose 5% to $1.66 billion in 2010 after having increased 3% in 2009 to $1.59 billion. Life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels. Premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows:

Premium by Distribution Method  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term: annualized premium in force, net sales, and first-year collected premium. Annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve-month period. Annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue. Net sales is

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

 annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except in the case of Direct Response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired. We believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued. First-year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future.  

Annualized life premium in force was $1.75 billion at December 31, 2010, an increase of 3% over $1.69 billion a year earlier. Annualized life premium in force was $1.63 billion at December 31, 2008.  

The following table shows net sales information for each of the last three years by distribution method.

Direct Response consists of two primary components: direct mail and insert media. Direct mail targets primarily young middle-income households with children. The juvenile life insurance policy is a key product. Not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales, but it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders. Parents and grandparents of these juvenile policyholders are more likely to respond favorably to a Direct Response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population. Also, both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition-cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time. At this time, we believe that the Direct Response unit is the largest U.S. writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance. We expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of Direct Responses premier markets.  

The insert media area targets primarily the adult market. It involves placing insurance solicitations as advertising inserts into a variety of media, such as coupon packets, newspapers, bank statements, and billings.

Index to Financial Statements 

The Direct Response operation accounted for 34% of our life insurance premium during 2010, the largest of any distribution group. Life premium for this channel rose 6% in 2010 and 5% in 2009. Net sales rose 4% in 2010 to $137 million after a 7% gain in 2009 to $132 million. First-year collected premium increased 6% in 2010 to $90 million after a 6% gain in 2009.  

The American Income Exclusive Agency focuses primarily on members of labor unions, but also on credit unions and other associations for its life insurance sales. It is Torchmarks highest profit margin business. Life premium for this agency rose 10% to $560 million in 2010, after having increased 7% in 2009. Net sales increased 8% in 2010 to $138 million from $128 million in 2009, as this agency was Torchmarks largest contributor to life net sales in 2010. Net sales rose 18% in 2009. First-year collected premium rose 16% in 2010 to $111 million, after having increased 17% in 2009. As in the case of all of Torchmarks agency distribution systems, continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count. The American Income agent count was 3,912 at December 31, 2010 compared with 4,154 a year earlier, a decline of 6%. However, the agent count rose 35% in 2009 from 3,085 at year end 2008, after having risen 21% in 2008. This agency continues to recruit new agents focusing on an incentive program to reward growth in both the recruiting of new agents and in the production of new business. Additionally, the systematic, centralized internet recruiting program has enhanced the recruiting of new agents.  

As previously mentioned, we have combined selected UA Exclusive Agency Branch Offices into the Liberty National Exclusive Agency. This Agency markets primarily low-face amount life insurance and supplemental health insurance to middle-income customers. Life premium income for this agency was $295 million in 2010, a 1% decrease compared with $298 million in 2009. Life premium for this agency declined 2% in 2009 from 2008. First-year collected premium on a combined basis declined 1% to $35 million in 2010, after having increased 6% in 2009.  

The Liberty Agencys net sales declined 19% to $45 million in 2010, after having increased 1% a year earlier. This agency had 2,001 producing agents at December 31, 2010, compared with 2,471 a year earlier, a decline of 19%. The agent count at Liberty had also declined 51% in 2009 from 5,020. The decrease in agent count has been due in part to the closing of several offices which have had low production. In addition, agent compensation issues that arose in 2009 have negatively impacted agent counts. A two-tier bonus threshold proved more difficult for producing agents to meet than anticipated. Management reverted to a level bonus threshold later in 2009. Also, due to deteriorating first-year persistency on business written during 2008 and early 2009, management modified compensation incentives in 2009 to place more emphasis on the persistency of newly issued policies. This resulted in the departure of a number of the less productive agents but improved first year persistency.  

The Liberty Exclusive Agency agent counts have also decreased due to issues related to its health insurance business. Until recently, the agencys health insurance marketing efforts had been focused on limited-benefit hospital-surgical plans. These plans were subject to intense competition which ultimately resulted in decreases in agent counts. In addition, these limited-benefit hospital-surgical plans became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments. Sales of these limited-benefit hospital/surgical plans were discontinued after September, 2010. In response, the agency has shifted its marketing focus to a product mix more weighted towards life insurance and supplemental health insurance products (not affected by healthcare reform) that have higher margins and persistency. We believe this will increase the Agencys profitability and stability in the long run.  

We also offer life insurance through Other Agencies consisting of the Military Agency, the United American Independent Agency, and other small miscellaneous sales agencies. The Military Agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who have historically sold primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families. This business consists of whole-life products with term insurance riders. Military premium represented 12% of life premium. The United American Independent Agency represented less than 2% of Torchmarks total life premium. This agency is focused on health insurance, with life sales being incidental.

Summary of Results  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Gross margins, as indicated by insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense, rose 7% in 2010 to $455 million after rising 3% in 2009. As a percentage of life insurance premium, gross margins have been stable each year at 27%. Margin growth in all periods was primarily the result of premium growth.  

Health Insurance. Health insurance sold by Torchmark includes primarily Medicare Supplement and Part D prescription drug coverage to enrollees in the federal Medicare program, cancer coverage, and accident coverage. All health coverage plans other than Medicare Supplement and Part D are classified here as limited-benefit plans. For several years, our primary health insurance product had been hospital/surgical plans. However, as previously mentioned, these plans became subject to intense competition which resulted in decreasing agent counts. In addition, these plans became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments. These factors contributed to the Companys decisions to de-emphasize and discontinue the marketing of these products. In 2010, Medicare Supplement sales exceeded those of the limited-benefit products for the first time since 2001, and represented 56% of health net sales exclusive of Medicare Part D. Medicare Supplement sales have been stronger than limited-benefit sales due in part to changes in agent counts in our health distribution groups discussed below.  

25  

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

Total health premium represented 37% of Torchmarks total premium income in 2010. Excluding Part D premium, health premium represented 32% in 2010, compared with 34% in 2009 and 38% in 2008. Health underwriting margin, excluding Part D, accounted for 24% of the total in 2010, compared with 26% in 2009 and 29% in 2008. These declines in the health percentages are indicative of the growth in the premium and profitability of our life segment in relation to our health segment. As mentioned previously, health results have also been negatively affected by increased competition in recent periods. The following table indicates health insurance premium income by distribution channel for each of the last three years.

 *   Total Medicare Part D premium and health premium exclude $.5 million in 2010 and $2.5 million in 2009 of risk-sharing premium paid to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services consistent with the Medicare Part D contract. In 2008, $122 thousand of risk-sharing premium was received, increasing premium. This risk-sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims, and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis.

Health insurance, excluding Medicare Part D. As noted under the caption Life Insurance, we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health, due to lifes superior margins and other benefits. Our health distribution groups have also encountered increased competition in recent periods. The increased competition has led to losses in agents in our Liberty Exclusive Agency and Independent Agencies. Agent turnover has increased as lower premium, lower margin products offered by competitors have provided agents with products that are easier to sell. Turnover has also increased due to the Companys decision to deemphasize the marketing of certain limited-benefit products as previously discussed. The marketing of these products was discontinued altogether after September, 2010. Declines in these agent counts have resulted in lower net sales, which in turn have pressured premium growth. Health premium, excluding Part D premium, fell 7% to $779 million in 2010, after declining 12% in 2009. Medicare Supplement premium declined 1% to $452 million in 2010, compared with a 6% decline in 2009. Other limited-benefit health premium dropped 14% in 2010 to $327 million, after a decline of 18% in 2009 and 9% in 2008. Net sales, excluding Medicare Part D, declined 33% to $64 million in 2010. Net sales fell 30% in 2009 to $97 million. Medicare Supplement net sales fell 21% in 2010, but rose 64% in 2009. Other health net sales continued to decline, falling 45% in 2010 and 54% in 2009. First year collected premium also declined in both 2010 and 2009.

Medicare Supplement provides the greatest amount of health premium, partially because Medicare Supplement products are generally more persistent than the limited-benefit products, but also because of more stable sales in recent periods. Medicare Supplement premium represented 58% of non-Part D health premium in 2010, compared with 55% in 2009 and 51% in 2008.  

The Liberty National Exclusive Agency is Torchmarks largest in terms of health premium income. In 2010, this Agency represented 43% of all Torchmark non-Part D income health premium at $331 million. The Liberty Agency markets Medicare Supplements and limited-benefit health products including cancer insurance. In 2010, health premium income in this Agency declined 15% from prior year premium of $389 million. Premium also fell 18% in 2009 from $476 million. First-year collected premium declined 52% to $16 million in 2010, after declining 62% a year earlier. As noted earlier, increased competition in the health insurance market and our de-emphasis of certain health products has caused declines in agent counts. Marketing of the de-emphasized products was discontinued altogether after September, 2010. The decline in agent counts has resulted in decreased new sales, translating into declines in premium. Net sales for 2010 declined 52% from $30 million in 2009 to $14 million. In 2009, this Agencys net sales fell 64%. Also discussed under the Life Insurance caption are efforts designed to strengthen this Agency.  

The UA Independent Agency is composed of independent agencies appointed with Torchmark whose size range from very large, multi-state organizations down to one-person offices. All of these agents generally sell for a number of insurance companies. Torchmark had 1,406 active producing agents at December 31, 2010. This agency is our largest distributor of non-Part D health insurance in terms of health net sales, representing 50% in 2010. This agency is also our largest carrier of Medicare Supplement insurance, with $267 million or 59% of our Medicare Supplement premium income in 2010. Net sales for this Agency dropped 25% to $32 million in 2010, after having gained 14% to $43 million in 2009. Medicare Supplement net sales of $27 million declined 10% from $30 million a year earlier. Medicare Supplement net sales had more than doubled in 2009 over net sales of $15 million in 2008. The increases in 2009 were due to increases in group Medicare Supplement sales. Group Medicare Supplement sales fluctuate greatly from period to period and do not indicate a trend. Total health premium income for the UA Independent Agency was $315 million in 2010, a 4% decline from 2009 premium of $326 million. Premium income also declined 9% in 2009 from 2008. These declines in premium have resulted as new sales have not compensated for lapses.  

The American Income Exclusive Agency, predominantly a life insurance distribution channel, is our third largest health insurance distributor based on 2010 premium collected. Its health plans are comprised of various limited-benefit plans. Approximately 70% of the agencys 2010 health premium was from accident policies. Sales of the plans by this agency are generally made in conjunction with a life policy being sold to the same customer.  

Health premium at this agency rose 5% in 2010 to $79 million, after having increased 2% to $75 million in 2009. Net health sales were $13 million in both 2010 and 2009, compared with $12 million in 2008. Net health sales comprised 9% of the American Income Agencys total net sales in 2010.  

Direct Response, primarily a life operation, also offers health insurance, which is predominantly Medicare Supplements sold directly to employer or union sponsored groups. In 2010, net health sales were $5 million, comprising approximately 4% of Direct Responses total life and health net sales. Direct Response health premium income has risen each year over the prior year. Health premium rose 17% in 2010 to $54 million and 3% in 2009.  

Medicare Part D. Torchmark, through its subsidiary United American, offers coverage under the governments Medicare Part D plan. The Medicare Part D plan is a stand-alone prescription drug plan for Medicare beneficiaries. Part D is regulated and partially funded by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) for participating private insurers like United American, unlike the traditional Medicare program for hospital and doctor services, where CMS is the primary insurer and private Medicare Supplement insurers are secondary insurers. The program generally calls for CMS to pay approximately two thirds of the premium with the insured Medicare beneficiary paying one third of the premium. Total Medicare Part D premium was $209 million in 2010, compared with $184 million in 2009, an increase of 14%. Part D premium rose 5% in 2009. Changes in Part D premium generally result from changes in the

Index to Financial Statements 

 number of enrollees. Enrollment for all Part D coverages ends on December 31 of the previous year, except for enrollees who reach age 65 in the current year. At December 31, 2010, United American had approximately 144 thousand enrollees for the 2011 Part D plan, compared with 158 thousand for the 2010 plan year and 147 thousand for the 2009 plan year. Our Medicare Part D product is sold primarily through the Direct Response operation, but is also sold to groups through the UA Independent agency. Part D net sales were $39 million in 2010, compared with $43 million in 2009 and $28 million in 2008. We count only sales to new first-time enrollees in net sales, and the majority of premium income was from previous enrollees.  

We believe that the Medicare Part D program is a meaningful component of our health product offerings because of our experience with the senior-age market and with Medicare Supplements, the government assurances with regard to the risk-sharing agreements for participating insurers, the incremental income added to our health insurance margins, and the renewal of the business every year. Due to our experience with service to the senior-age market and the use of our existing Direct Response marketing system, entry to this business required little new investment. However, we do not expect significant growth in the Part D product in the near future, as most Medicare beneficiaries have already chosen a plan. Additionally, as with any government-sponsored program, the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market.

In 2008, $122 thousand of risk-sharing premium was received, increasing premium. This risk-sharing amount is a portion of the excess or deficiency of actual over expected claims, and therefore we view this payment as a component of policyholder benefits in our segment analysis.

Torchmarks health insurance underwriting margin before other income and administrative expense declined 12% in 2009 to $170 million but stabilized in 2010, remaining flat at $170 million. As a percentage of premium income, margins were stable in all periods at approximately 17%.  

Annuities. As described in Note 3Discontinued Operations, we sold our subsidiary United Investors. United Investors was our carrier of variable annuities and a primary carrier of fixed annuities. As a result of the sale, we disposed of approximately 37% of our annuity deposit balance as of December 31, 2010, including all variable annuities. These balances have been reported as Held for Sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of prior periods. Accordingly, we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward.  

Our fixed annuity balances at the end of 2010, 2009, and 2008 were $1.24 billion, $959 million, and $817 million, respectively.  

An analysis of underwriting income is as follows.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 *   A significant portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements. This spread sometimes results in negative net policy obligations.  

While the fixed annuity account balance has increased each year over the prior year, policy charges and underwriting income have fluctuated only modestly. The stability in fixed annuity policy charges has resulted as the charges consist of surrender charges and are not based on account size. These charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods. A considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements, which can result in negative net policy obligations. In both 2010 and 2009, the spreads for fixed annuities increased over the prior year as a result of credited rate reductions on the inforce annuities. Furthermore, spreads were increased by the introduction of a new annuity form on Liberty National paper in mid-2009. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs also rose as these costs are amortized in relation to gross profits.

Administrative expenses. Operating expenses are included in the Other and Corporate Segments and are classified into two categories: insurance administrative expenses and expenses of the parent company. The following table is an analysis of operating expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2010.  

Operating Expenses Selected Information  

(Dollar amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Insurance administrative expenses rose 4% in 2010, after having declined 4% in 2009. As a percentage of premium, they increased to 5.9% in 2010 from 5.8% in both 2009 and 2008. The 2010 increase was caused primarily by higher employee costs, mostly related to higher employee health benefit costs. Partially offsetting the increase in employee costs was a decline in legal costs, as we favorably settled certain previously reserved litigation during 2010. In 2009, increases in salaries were more than offset by declines in other administrative costs and other employee costs. As a result of the effort to achieve greater consistency in expense classification among our subsidiaries, we deferred $12 million more of deferrable administrative expense to acquisition expense in 2009 compared with 2008. These reductions in administrative expense were partially offset by increases in pension and other employee benefit costs during the period.

As mentioned in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we settled litigation for $2.5 million in 2008 relating to issues occurring many years ago. As previously noted, we do not consider the costs of settling litigation applicable to prior periods to be related to current insurance operations. Stock compensation expense declined in 2009, primarily as a result of the lower stock price caused by the severe market decline in 2009 and the effect it had on values at the time of our annual stock and stock option grants for 2009. Expense related to the new 2009 grants replaced the expense for costlier older grants that became fully vested. Stock compensation expense rose in 2010 as market conditions improved, resulting in higher values for stock and option grants in 2010. Management believes that stock compensation expense will increase slightly in 2011. As stated in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense, and therefore treats it as a Parent Company expense. As described in Note 4Investments under the caption Other-than-temporary impairments, we wrote down certain Company-occupied real estate because it met our criteria as described in that note for other-than-temporary impairment. As a result, we incurred a pretax charge of $2.1 million in 2008 and $355 thousand in 2009 which are included in Operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the respective year.  

Investments. We manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. It is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in Note 14Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. It is defined as net investment income less both the interest credited to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs. We also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used over $4.2 billion of cash flow to repurchase Torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. Share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest-bearing assets, but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding. In order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment.

Excess investment income increased $21 million or 8% in 2010 over the prior year. Excess investment income declined $28 million or 9% in 2009. On a per diluted share basis, excess investment income rose 9% to $3.62 per share in 2010, after having declined 3% in the prior year. Share purchases caused the 2010 increase in per share excess investment income to be greater than the dollar amount of increase. Likewise, those purchases also caused the decline in per share excess investment income in 2009 to be less than the decline in the dollar amount.  

The largest component of excess investment income is net investment income, which rose 8% to $685 million in 2010. It increased 1% to $632 million in 2009 from $627 million in 2008. Presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income compared with the growth in mean invested assets.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In 2010, the growth in net investment income exceeded the growth in mean invested assets (at amortized cost) for the first time in many years. One of the primary reasons that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of. Another factor that has contributed to the relatively slower growth rate of investment income is the time lag between the date proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and the date such proceeds are reinvested. During these lags, we have held cash at lower yields. One of the most important factors contributing to the low growth rate in investment income during 2009 is the fact that, due primarily to uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets, we held significantly more cash and short term investments during 2009 than we did during 2010 and 2008. Had we not done so, and if short term investment rates had not been much lower during 2009 than in 2008, the growth rate in investment income during 2009 would have been approximately the same as the growth rate in mean assets.

Excess investment income is reduced by interest credited to net insurance policy liabilities and the interest paid on corporate debt. Information about interest credited to policy liabilities is shown in the following table.  

Interest Credited to Net Insurance Policy Liabilities  

(Dollar amounts in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The average interest crediting rate has risen in each of the last three years. In 2001, as part of our normal review of policy reserve assumptions, we increased the interest rate assumption 100 basis points (1%) on policies issued after January 1, 2001. As this group of policies becomes a larger proportion of our business, the average crediting rate will continue to increase. For more specific information on life and health crediting rates, please refer to Note 6Future Policy Benefit Reserves in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs. Financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income. The table below reconciles interest expense per the Consolidated Statements of Operations to financing costs.

The table below presents the components of financing costs.  

Analysis of Financing Costs  

(Amounts in thousands)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Financing costs increased $6 million or 8% in 2010. They rose $7 million or 11% in 2009. The increases in financing costs in both years reflect the issuance in June 2009 of $300 million principal amount 9 ¼% Senior Notes due in 2019. In 2010, we incurred a full year of interest on this issue. The increase in 2009 was partially offset by the maturity in August 2009 of $99 million principal amount 8 ¼% Senior Debentures. Short-term interest expense has trended downward over the past three years, decreasing $3 million in 2010 after having declined $4 million in 2009. These declines have resulted from significantly lower interest rates when compared with the respective prior year. The 2010 decrease was also impacted by a 22% decline in the average balance of commercial paper outstanding compared with 2009.  

Excess investment income benefits from increases in long-term rates available on new investments and decreases in short-term borrowing rates. Of these two factors, higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short-term rates.  

Investment Acquisitions. Torchmarks current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investment-grade fixed maturities generally with long maturities (maturity date more than 20 years after acquisition date) that meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. We believe this strategy is appropriate because our strong positive cash flows are generally stable and predictable. If such longer-term securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives, we consider investing in short-term securities, taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors at the time. During calendar years 2008 through 2010, Torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities.

The following table summarizes selected information for fixed-maturity purchases. The effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield. This date is commonly known as the worst call date. Two different average life calculations are shown, average life to the next call date and average life to the maturity date.  

Fixed Maturity Acquisitions Selected Information  

(Dollar amounts in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable (on other than a make-whole basis) prior to maturity, but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so. For investments in callable bonds, the actual life of the investment will depend on whether or not (and if so, when) the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date. Given our investments in callable bonds, the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment. However, the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity. Data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart. The average life of funds invested in 2009 (to both next call and maturity) was lower than that of funds invested during 2008 and 2010 due to actions taken for statutory capital management purposes and the limited availability of longer term investments.  

During the three years 2008 through 2010, we have invested primarily in investment-grade corporate bonds. During 2008, we invested a considerable amount of the funds in trust preferred securities and redeemable preferred stocks with longer scheduled maturity dates, often exceeding 30 years. In virtually all cases, such securities are callable many years prior to the scheduled maturity date. During 2009 and 2010, we acquired a significant amount of taxable municipal bonds, primarily Build America Bonds authorized by the American Recovery and Retirement Act of 2009. In assessing the creditworthiness of these bonds, we took into account the geographic location of the municipalities. The investments in these municipal bonds consisted almost exclusively of general obligation bonds and revenue bonds for essential services.  

New cash flow available to us for investment has been affected by issuer calls as a result of the low-interest environment experienced during the past three years, although this effect has diminished each successive year. Issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost. Calls increase funds available for investment, but they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called. Issuer calls were $109 million in 2010, $181 million in 2009, and $238 million in 2008. The higher level of acquisitions in 2009 was primarily due to the additional cash flow available from the special sales transactions noted below.

Sales transactions. As disclosed in Note 4Investments, the Company sold $703 million of fixed maturities at amortized cost in the third quarter of 2009, including $293 million of below- investment-grade securities. The market value for some of these securities increased significantly during the period to a level where, even though the sales price was less than amortized cost, management determined that better risk-adjusted returns could be achieved by selling rather than continuing to hold the securities. Other securities were sold at prices that produced gains to offset these losses for tax purposes. Due in large part to selling below-investment-grade securities and reinvesting the proceeds in investment-grade securities, below-investment-grade securities as a percentage of total fixed maturities at amortized cost declined from 15% at June 30, 2009 to 9% at December 31, 2009. The reduction in below-investment-grade securities had a positive impact on the risk-based capital position of our insurance subsidiaries.  

Portfolio Analysis. Because Torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixed-maturity securities, the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms. The following table presents a comparison of Torchmarks components of invested assets at amortized cost as of December 31, 2010 with the latest industry data.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2010, approximately 94% of our investments at book value were in a diversified fixed-maturity portfolio. Policy loans, which are secured by policy cash values, made up an additional 3%. The remaining balance was comprised of other investments including equity securities, mortgage loans, and other long-term and short-term investments.

At December 31, 2010, fixed maturities had a fair value of $10.5 billion, compared with $9.1 billion at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, fixed maturities were in a $108 million net unrealized gain position compared with an unrealized loss position of $455 million at December 31, 2009. Approximately 74% of our fixed maturity assets at December 31, 2010 at amortized cost were corporate bonds and 13% were redeemable preferred stocks. This compares with 73% corporate bonds and 14% redeemable preferred stocks at year end 2009. At December 31, 2010, less than 2% of the assets at amortized cost were residential mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The $57 million of CDOs at amortized cost made up less than 1% of the assets and are backed primarily by trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies. The $16 million of mortgage-backed securities are rated AAA. For more information about our fixed-maturity portfolio by component at December 31, 2010 and 2009, including an analysis of unrealized investment losses and a schedule of maturities, see Note 4Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Credit Risk Sensitivity. Credit risk is the level of certainty that a securitys issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity. Approximately 87% of our fixed-maturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities (including redeemable preferred and asset-backed securities). As we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities, credit risk is a concern. We mitigate this ongoing risk, in part, by acquiring investment-grade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer. We continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis. We also seek to reduce credit risk by maintaining investments in a large number of issuers over a wide range of industry sectors.  

The following table presents the relative percentage of our fixed maturities by industry sector at December 31, 2010.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2010, approximately 35% of the fixed maturity assets at amortized cost (34% at fair value) were in the financial sector, including 16% in life and health or property casualty insurance companies and 14% in banks at amortized cost. Financial guarantors, mortgage insurers, and insurance brokers comprised approximately 5% of the portfolio. After financials, the next largest sector was utilities, which comprised 15% of the portfolio at amortized cost. The balance of the portfolio is spread among 268 issuers in a wide variety of sectors. As previously noted, gross unrealized losses were $368 million at December 31, 2010, declining from $699 million a year earlier. As shown in the chart above, the portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position at December 31, 2010, compared with a net unrealized loss position at the prior year end. Approximately 60% of the change in the fair value relative to amortized cost in 2010 was attributable to improvements in the financial sectors, while the remaining 40% was in the non-financial sectors. As discussed in Note 4Investments, we believe much of the unrealized losses experienced in 2008 and 2009 were attributable to illiquidity in the financial markets. We expect to recover the full book value of our investments in impaired securities.  

As shown in the table above, the ratio of gross unrealized losses to book value was greater than 45% for our investments in CDOs and the financial guarantor sector. We evaluated each of the impaired securities in these and all other sectors to determine whether or not any of the impairments were other-than-temporary. Certain information about our evaluation of the impaired securities in the CDO and monoline insurer sectors is provided in the following paragraphs.

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

At December 31, 2010, we held investments in five different CDOs. In our opinion, our investments in four of these CDOs were other-than-temporarily impaired. Three of these CDOs have been written down to a carrying value of zero. The fourth is carried at a value of $34 million, less than the present value of discounted future cash flows at original purchase yield but greater than its fair value of $17 million. The fifth CDO ($22 million amortized cost and $6 million fair value) we believe was not other-than-temporarily impaired. At December 31, 2009, the four CDOs that were other-than-temporarily impaired had an amortized cost of $34 million ($13 million fair value). The CDO that was not other-than-temporarily impaired had an amortized cost of $21 million ($5 million fair value). In reaching these conclusions concerning other-than-temporary impairment, we reviewed and discussed with the collateral managers of each of these CDOs the current status of the collateral underlying our investments, the credit events (defaults and deferrals in underlying collateral) experienced to date, and the possibility of future credit events. We calculated expected future cash flows using assumptions for expected future credit events that reflect actual historical experience and expected future experience. We reviewed the actual versus expected cash flows received to date and the impact that potential future credit events would have on our expected future cash flows. We calculated the magnitude of future credit events that could be experienced without negatively impacting the recovery of our investment and our expected yield rate. While there is a possibility that future credit events will exceed our current expectations, we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions.  

Also at December 31, 2009, we held investments issued by five different monoline insurers. In our opinion, our investments in three of these monoline insurers ($9 million amortized cost and $10 million fair value) were other-than-temporarily impaired. These securities were sold in 2010 for $12 million for a realized gain of $3 million. Our investments in the other two monoline insurers ($83 million amortized cost and $37 million fair value at December 31, 2009) were not believed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. At December 31, 2010, these two investments were carried at an amortized cost of $84 million (fair value $56 million). We collected and analyzed a significant amount of information to form opinions about the reasons for the severity of our impairments, including the illiquidity of some of our holdings (and its impact on fair values), the expected future experience in the mortgage market, and the reasonable expectation of the receipt of all future contractual interest and principal payments for these investments. We reviewed news and information about the economy and the mortgage market in general and about the issuers of our investments. We reviewed and analyzed financial statements and had discussions with sell-side and independent credit analysts who follow this sector, certain regulators, and members of the management teams of some of the issuers of our investments. While there is a possibility that future experience in the mortgage markets will differ from our current expectations, we believe there is ample evidence to support our conclusions.

An analysis of the fixed-maturity portfolio by a composite rating at December 31, 2010 is shown in the table below.  

Fixed Maturities by Rating  

At December 31, 2010  

(Dollar amounts in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The portfolio has a weighted average quality rating of BBB+ based on amortized cost. Approximately 92% of the portfolio at amortized cost was considered investment grade. Our investment portfolio contains no securities backed by sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages (loans for which some of the typical documentation was not provided by the borrower). We have no direct investments in residential mortgages, nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any credit default swaps or other derivative contracts. We do not participate in securities lending. There are no off-balance sheet investments, as all investments are reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2010, we had $22 million at fair value ($57 million book value) invested in CDOs, for which the composite rating at that date was C+. The collateral underlying these CDOs is primarily trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies, and no sub-prime or Alt-A mortgages are included in the collateral.  

Our current investment policy is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. Thus, any increases in below investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings.

Market Risk Sensitivity. Torchmarks financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk, meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the companys investment portfolio. Since 94% of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed-maturity investments (and virtually all of these investments are fixed-rate investments), the portfolio is highly subject to market risk. Declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value. Under normal market conditions, we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because it is generally our investment strategy to hold these investments to maturity. The long-term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash-flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio. The increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offset the impact of rates on the investment portfolio. However, in accordance with GAAP, these liabilities are not marked to market.  

The following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest-rate sensitive fixed-maturity portfolio at December 31, 2010 and 2009. This table measures the effect of a change in interest rates (as represented by the U.S. Treasury curve) on the fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio. The data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of 100 basis points.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Realized Gains and Losses. Our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits, sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future. In addition to the payment of these benefits, we also incur acquisition costs, administrative expenses, and taxes as a part of insurance operations. Because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations. For this reason, we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations. This portfolio consists primarily of high-quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long-term insurance product obligations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities. Expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations.  

Because our investment portfolio is large and diverse, investments are occasionally sold or called, resulting in a realized gain or loss. These gains and losses occur only incidentally, usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers. Investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments. We do not engage in trading investments for profit. Therefore, gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield, or which result from events that are beyond our control, are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders.  

Realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations, and as a result, can have a material positive or negative impact on net income. The significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the period-to-period trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations. Accordingly, they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations. For these reasons, and in line with industry practice, we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results.

   *   Written down due to other-than-temporary impairment.  

As described in Note 4Investments under the caption Other-than temporary impairments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we wrote certain securities down to fair value during each year 2008 through 2010 as a result of other-than-temporary impairment. The impaired securities met our criteria for other-than-temporary impairment as discussed in Note 4 and in our Critical Accounting Policies in this report. The writedowns resulted in pretax charges of $5 million in 2010 ($3 million after tax), $143 million in 2009 ($94 million after tax), and $106 million in 2008 ($69 million after tax). The 2009 charge included $83 million on CDOs ($55 million after tax) and $24 million on monoline financial guarantors and mortgage insurers ($16 million after tax). The remaining writedowns in 2009 were from losses on a variety of corporate bonds. In 2008, the significant bonds written down were Lehman Brothers bonds of $74 million pretax ($48 million after tax) and Washington Mutual bonds of $19 million pretax ($12 million after tax). Other writedowns in 2008 included perpetual preferred stocks of Federal National Mortgage Association and certain non-financial securities.  

Additionally, as described in Note 4, we wrote down a real estate investment to fair value in 2008, resulting in a loss of $1.1 million ($718 thousand after tax). We wrote down an additional $205 thousand ($133 thousand after tax) in 2009 on this investment. In 2010, we acquired $7.3 million book value of our 9 1/4% Senior Notes at a cost of $8.9 million, resulting in an after-tax loss on debt redemption of $1.1 million.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  

Liquidity. Liquidity provides Torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations. Our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources: positive cash flow from operations, a portfolio of marketable securities, and a line of credit facility.  

The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated positive cash flows in excess of our immediate needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes.  

Insurance Subsidiary Liquidity. The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. The funds to provide for policy benefits, the majority of which are paid in future periods, are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities to meet these long-term obligations. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash. Excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the Parent Company, subject to regulatory restriction. The dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries prior year earnings calculated on a statutory basis.  

Parent Company Liquidity. Cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay Parent Company dividends on common and preferred stock, interest and principal repayments on Parent Company debt, and operating expenses of the Parent. In 2010, the Parent received $401 million of dividends and transfers from its insurance subsidiaries, as compared with $392 million in 2009 and $437 million in 2008. After paying debt obligations, shareholder dividends, and other expenses (but before share repurchases), Torchmark Parent had excess operating cash flow in 2010 of approximately $269 million. Parent Company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes, such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases. In 2011, it is expected that the Parent Company will receive $742 million in dividends from subsidiaries, including approximately $305 million of the proceeds from the sale of United Investors, and that approximately $655 million will be available as excess cash flow. Certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends. For more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries, see the restrictions section of Note 12Shareholders Equity in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these restrictions exist, dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the Parent Company. As additional liquidity, the Parent held $63 million of cash and short-term investments at December 31, 2010, compared with $155 million a year earlier. The Parent also had available a $138 million receivable from subsidiaries at December 31, 2010.  

Short-Term Borrowings. An additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $600 million. As described in the Commercial Paper section of Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, this facility was entered into on December 10, 2010 and replaced an earlier $600 million facility which would have expired in August, 2011. As of December 31, 2010, we had available $203 million under this facility. For detailed information about this new line of credit facility, see the Commercial Paper section of Note 11Debt.

(Dollar amounts in millions)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 *   Annualized  

There have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market under this facility during the years ending December 31, 2010 and 2009.  

In summary, Torchmark expects to have readily available funds for 2011 and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the Company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of additional debt, a short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing.  

Consolidated Liquidity. Consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were $1.03 billion in 2010, compared with $976 million in 2009, and $731 million in 2008. In addition to cash inflows from operations, our companies have received $321 million in investment calls and tenders and $318 million of scheduled maturities or repayments during 2010. Maturities, tenders, and calls totaled $761 million in 2009 and $581 million in 2008.  

Our cash and short-term investments were $582 million at year-end 2010 and $529 million at year-end 2009. Included in cash at December 31, 2010 was the $343 million of proceeds received from the sale of United Investors on that date. Additionally, we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. These securities had a fair value of $10.5 billion at December 31, 2010. However, our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. As fully described and discussed in Note 11Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and under the subcaption Funded Debt, Torchmark had outstanding $120 million (par amount) 7.1% Trust Preferred Securities at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. The capital trust liable for these securities is the legal entity which is responsible for the securities and facilitates the payment of dividends to shareholders. The trust is an off-balance sheet arrangement which we are required to deconsolidate in accordance with GAAP rules. Deconsolidation is required because the capital trust is considered to be a variable interest entity in which we have no variable interest. Therefore Torchmark is not the primary beneficiary of the entity, even though we own all of the entitys voting equity and have guaranteed the entitys performance. While these liabilities are not on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, they are represented by Torchmarks 7.1% Junior Subordinated Debentures due to the trust. These Junior Subordinated Debentures were a Torchmark liability of $124 million par and book value at both December 31, 2010 and 2009. These securities are indicated as a capital resource to us under the caption Capital Resources in this report. The 7.1% preferred dividends due to the preferred shareholders are funded by our 7.1% interest payment on our debt to the trusts. As described in Note 15Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have guaranteed the performance of the capital trust to meet its financial obligations to the Trust Preferred shareholders.

Index to Financial Statements 

As a part of its above-mentioned credit facility, Torchmark has outstanding $198 million in stand-by letters of credit. However, these letters are issued among our subsidiaries and have no impact on company obligations as a whole.  

As of December 31, 2010, we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third-party entities other than as described above. All of our guarantees, other than the Trust Preferred guarantee, were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries, as disclosed in Note 15Commitments and Contingencies.  

The following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of December 31, 2010.

 (2) Interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (5) Future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force at December 31, 2010. These estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality, morbidity and persistency. The actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown. Management believes that the assets supporting the liability of $9.2 billion at December 31, 2010, along with future premiums and investment income, will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations.

Capital Resources. Torchmarks capital structure consists of short-term debt (the commercial paper facility described in Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), long-term funded debt, Junior Subordinated Debentures supporting its Trust Preferred Securities, and shareholders equity. The Junior Subordinated Debentures are payable to Torchmarks Capital Trust III which is liable for its Trust Preferred Securities. In accordance with GAAP, these instruments are included in Due to affiliates on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A complete analysis and description of long-term debt issues outstanding is presented in Note 11Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The carrying value of the funded debt was $913 million at December 31, 2010, compared with $920 million a year earlier. As fully explained in Note 11Debt, we issued $300 million principal amount of 9¼% Senior Notes due in 2019 in June of 2009 for proceeds of $296 million. A portion of these proceeds were used to repay the $99 million due upon the August, 2009 maturity of our 8¼% Senior Debentures. Of the $197 million balance of the proceeds, $175 million was contributed as capital to our insurance subsidiaries in 2009. The subsidiaries then in turn invested these funds in investment-grade corporate bonds and municipal bonds. The capital contributions were made as a result of our desire to maintain subsidiary regulatory capital at levels adequate to meet the requirements of rating agencies.  

Poor economic conditions experienced during 2009 caused the ratings of many bonds in our insurance subsidiaries portfolios to be downgraded and also resulted in increased other-than-temporary impairments taken. This large volume of ratings downgrades and impairments in 2009 had a significant negative effect on the subsidiaries regulatory capital. Our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least 325% of required regulatory capital under Risk-Based Capital (RBC), a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital. The 325% target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows, the relatively low risk of their product mix, and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for Torchmark. RBC was favorably impacted in 2009 by these capital contributions and the sales of below-investment-grade securities discussed under the caption InvestmentsSales Transactions in this report. Improvements in financial markets in 2010 which resulted in rating upgrades in the bond portfolios further strengthened the capital position of our insurance subsidiaries in 2010. At both December 31, 2010 and 2009, our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had RBC ratios in excess of 350%. Should we experience additional impairments and ratings downgrades in the future and the ratio falls below 325%, management has available cash on hand and a credit line at the Parent Company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 325%.  

As noted under the caption Highlights in this report, we reactivated our share repurchase program during the first quarter of 2010. We previously had suspended the program indefinitely in March, 2009 due to general economic conditions at that time. Under this program, we acquired 4 million shares at a cost of $204 million in 2010 (average of $53.51 million per share), 2 million shares for $47 million in 2009, and 8 million shares for $427 million in 2008. The majority of purchased shares are retired each year. Please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption Highlights in this report.  

Torchmark has recently increased the dividend on its common shares. In the first quarter of 2010, the dividend was increased from $.14 per share to $.15 per share and in the fourth quarter of 2010, it was further increased to $.16 per share.  

Shareholders equity was $4.0 billion at December 31, 2010, compared with $3.4 billion at December 31, 2009. During the twelve months since December 31, 2009, shareholders equity was reduced by the $204 million in share purchases but has been increased by after tax unrealized gains of $345 million in the fixed maturity portfolio as conditions in financial markets have improved. As explained in Note 4Investmentsunrealized loss analysis, unrealized losses in 2008 and early 2009 resulted primarily from illiquidity in the financial markets as a result of general economic conditions.  

We plan to use excess cash as efficiently as possible in the future but we will be cautious in doing so. Excess cash flow could be used for share repurchases, acquisitions, increases in shareholder dividends, investment in fixed maturities, or repayment of short-term debt. We will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies.

We maintain a significant available-for-sale fixed-maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders liabilities. Current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. The period-to-period changes in fair value, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders equity. Changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets. While invested assets are revalued, accounting rules do not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as assets, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders equity. Due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders equity, this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders equity. If these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets, the effect on equity would be largely offset. Fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period-to-period presentation of our shareholders equity, capital structure, and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest-bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets. Recently, the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio had been depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity resulting in a significant decrease in shareholders equity. Because of the long-term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, our management, credit rating agencies, lenders, many industry analysts, and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios.  

The following tables present selected data related to our capital resources. Additionally, the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items, so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on Torchmarks capital structure.

 ** Includes Torchmarks 7.1% Junior Subordinated Debentures in 2010 and 2009 in the amount of $124 million.  

 *** Torchmarks debt covenants require that the effect of the accounting rule requiring revaluation be removed to determine this ratio. This ratio is computed by dividing total debt by the sum of debt and shareholders equity.  

Effective in 2008, the FASB issued new guidance, offering an option which, if elected, would permit us to value our interest-bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, unlike current accounting rules which permit us to account for changes in our available-for-sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income, the new rule requires such changes to be recorded in earnings. Because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder liabilities and debt, the impact on earnings could be very significant and volatile, causing reported earnings not to be reflective of core results. Therefore, we have not elected this option.

The fixed maturity portfolio contained $1.8 billion in net unrealized investment losses at year end 2008 ($1.1 billion after tax and the associated adjustment to deferred acquisition costs) including fixed maturities in the subsidiary sold in 2010. These unrealized losses are believed by management to have been brought on by widening credit spreads in financial markets, and were the primary factor in the decline in our shareholders equity in 2008. In 2009, as conditions in financial markets began to improve, unrealized losses declined $1.3 billion ($.9 billion after tax). As financial markets continued to improve in 2010, the $456 million of unrealized losses at year end 2009 in the fixed maturity portfolio turned into $107 million of unrealized gains, a positive change of $531 million after taking into account the adjustment of $32 million to deferred acquisition costs ($345 million after tax). Torchmarks ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements (times interest earned) was 11.3 times in 2010, compared with 9.3 times in 2009 and 10.9 times in 2008. This times-interest-earned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pre-tax income from continuing operations and interest expense. A discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption Investments in this report.  

Credit Ratings. The chart below presents Torchmarks credit ratings as of December 31, 2010.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During the three year period ended December 31, 2010, each of the rating agencies revised the outlook for Torchmark from stable to negative and then back to stable. Reasons cited for the negative outlook included increased risk in our investment portfolio, tighter liquidity, and reduced financial flexibility. Reasons cited for the revision back to a stable outlook included improved financial flexibility, increased capital levels at the insurance subsidiaries, the decrease in unrealized losses, and strong operating performance.  

The credit quality of Torchmarks debt instruments and capital securities are rated by various rating agencies. During 2009, A. M. Best downgraded our preferred stock from bbb+ to bbb. Also in 2009, Fitch downgraded our Senior Debt from A to BBB+ (two notches), our preferred stock from A- to BBB (two notches), and our commercial paper from F1 to F2 (one notch). Fitch stated that the downgrades were a result of the weakness in the statutory capital position of Torchmarks insurance subsidiaries brought on by the ratings downgrades of fixed maturity securities held in the subsidiaries investment portfolios. They also expressed concern with the level of intercompany financing by the Parent Company from the subsidiaries, the ongoing exposure to financial market turmoil, and the expectation of continued investment deterioration going forward. In January, 2010, Fitch further downgraded our preferred stock one notch to BBB-. At that time, Fitch downgraded over 200 hybrid securities issued by insurance industry entities, as their assessments of these securities in our industry changed.  

The financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is also rated by Standard & Poors and A. M. Best. The following chart presents these ratings for our four largest insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2010.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

A.M. Best states that it assigns an A+ (Superior) rating to those companies which, in its opinion, have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the life/health insurance industry. A+ (Superior) companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time. The A.M. Best A (Excellent) rating is assigned to those companies which, in its opinion, have demonstrated excellent overall performance when compared to the norms of the life/health insurance industry. A (Excellent) companies have an excellent ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time.

The AA financial strength rating category is assigned by Standard & Poors Corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics, differing only slightly from those rated higher. The minus sign (-) shows the relative standing within the major rating category. The A rating is assigned to an insurer with strong financial security characteristics, somewhat more likely to be affected by adverse business conditions than insurers with higher ratings.  

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES  

Information regarding related party transactions is found in Note 16Related Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

OTHER ITEMS  

Litigation. Torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation, much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries. Such punitive damage claims that are tried in Alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in Alabama are based upon the compensatory damages (including mental anguish) awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined. Additionally, it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the State of Mississippi, a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts. This bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material. For more information concerning litigation, please refer to Note 15Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

NEW UNADOPTED ACCOUNTING RULES  

The FASB has issued new accounting guidance potentially applicable to Torchmark, effective in future periods:  

Policy Acquisition Costs: This new accounting guidance amends the accounting for costs associated with acquiring or renewing insurance contracts in order to address the diversity in practice surrounding the capitalization and deferral of these costs. This guidance will be effective for Torchmark beginning January 1, 2012, with early adoption permitted. Prospective or retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the new guidance. At this time we expect its adoption to reduce our shareholders equity approximately 8% at the time of adoption. We intend to adopt this guidance retrospectively. Because both the deferral and amortization of acquisition costs will be lower in future periods, and those effects are largely offsetting, we do not expect that there will be a material impact on operating results going forward.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Future Policy Benefits. Because of the long-term nature of insurance contracts, our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future. The liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry. The accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A list of the significant assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits is reported in Note 6Future Policy Benefit Reserves.  

Approximately 78% of our liabilities for future policy benefits at December 31, 2010 were traditional insurance liabilities whereby the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits. The assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are locked in and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts, except where there is a premium deficiency, as defined in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Future Policy Benefits. Otherwise, variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies. A premium deficiency event for Torchmarks traditional business is very rare, and did not occur during the three years ended December 31, 2010.  

The remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business, whereby the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date. Accordingly, there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business.  

Deferred Acquisition Costs and Value of Insurance Purchased. The costs of acquiring new business are generally deferred and recorded as an asset. Deferred acquisition costs consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs of new insurance sales. Additionally, the costs of acquiring blocks of insurance from other companies or through the acquisition of other companies are also deferred and recorded as assets under the caption Value of Insurance Purchased as indicated in Note 5Deferred Acquisition Costs and Value of Insurance Purchased in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Approximately 97% of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at December 31, 2010 were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium-paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums. The projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue. These assumptions are locked-in at that time and, except where there is a loss recognition issue, are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts. Absent a premium deficiency, variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume. We have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended December 31, 2010.  

The remaining portion of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits. These contracts are not subject to lock-in. The assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised. As noted earlier in this report, our variable annuity block was disposed of as of December 31, 2010. Revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended December 31, 2010.  

Policy Claims and Other Benefits Payable. This liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us. The estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us. However, the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns. Factors involved include the litigation environment, regulatory mandates, and the introduction of  

54  

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

 policy types for which claim patterns are not well established, and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims. Changes in these estimates, if any, are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made. We believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits, including the estimate of unsubmitted claims, are the most appropriate under the circumstances. However, there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation. At this time, we do not expect any change in estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience.  

Valuation of Fixed Maturities. We hold a substantial investment in high-quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time. While these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity, they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time, primarily to maintain our investment quality and diversification standards. We report this portfolio at fair value. Fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction. The fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets, having a greater impact on longer-term maturities. Because of the size of our fixed-maturity portfolio, small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the Company. This impact is disclosed in 100 basis point increments under the caption Market Risk Sensitivity in this report. However, as discussed under the caption Financial Condition in this report, we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and, as such, we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios.  

During recent periods, the values of our fixed maturities were also affected by illiquidity in the financial markets, which contributed to a spread widening, and accordingly unrealized losses, on many securities that we expect to be fully recoverable. Even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products. Considerable information concerning the policies, procedures, classification levels, and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed-maturity investments is presented in Note 4Investments under the caption Fair Value Measurements.  

Impairment of Investments. We continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value, where fair value has declined below carrying value. While the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions, an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed other than temporary. The policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in Note 1Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4Investments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and the discussions under the captions Investments and Realized Gains and Losses in this report. While every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other-than-temporary impairment, it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security.  

Defined benefit pension plans. We maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full-time employees. We also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees. Our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions. In accordance with GAAP, an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time. These obligations are offset, at least in part, by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans. At December 31, 2010, our net liability under these plans was $286 million.  

The actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover, retirement age, the expected return on plan assets, projected salary increases, and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled. These assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation. A decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation. A decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation. Small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans. While we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions, given the information available from company experience, economic data, independent consultants and other sources, we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected. Our discount rate, rate of

Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. If these estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, the actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on the basis of such estimates or assumptions. Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments, which may be national in scope, related to the insurance industry generally, or applicable to Torchmark specifically. Such events or developments could include, but are not necessarily limited to:  

1) Changes in lapse rates and/or sales of our insurance policies as well as levels of mortality, morbidity and utilization of healthcare services that differ from our assumptions;  

2) Federal and state legislative and regulatory developments, particularly those impacting taxes and changes to the federal Medicare program that would affect Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D insurance;  

3) Market trends in the senior-aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional Medicare, such as health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and other managed care or private plans, and that could affect the sales of traditional Medicare Supplement insurance;  

4) Interest rate changes that affect product sales and/or investment portfolio yield;  

5) General economic, industry sector or individual debt issuers financial conditions that may affect the current market value of securities that we own, or that may impair issuers ability to pay interest due us on those securities;  

6) Changes in pricing competition;  

7) Litigation results;  

8) Levels of administrative and operational efficiencies that differ from our assumptions;  

9) Our inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for health insurance policies due to regulatory delay;
