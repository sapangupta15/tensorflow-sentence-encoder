       Forward-Looking Statements  

Overview of Business  

The Corporation is a global health and hygiene company with manufacturing facilities in 36 countries and its products are sold in more than 150 countries. The Corporations products are sold under such well-known brands as Kleenex, Scott, Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kotex and Depend. The Corporation has four reportable global business segments: Personal Care; Consumer Tissue; K-C Professional & Other; and Health Care. These global business segments are described in greater detail in Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

In managing its global business, the Corporations management believes that developing new and improved products, responding effectively to competitive challenges, obtaining and maintaining leading market shares, controlling costs, and managing currency and commodity risks are important to the long-term success of the Corporation. The discussion and analysis of results of operations and other related information will refer to these factors.  

       Product innovationPast results and future prospects depend in large part on product innovation. The Corporation relies on its ability to develop and introduce new or improved products to drive sales and volume growth and to achieve and/or maintain category leadership. In order to introduce new or improved products, the technology to support those products must be acquired or developed. Research and development expenditures are directed towards new or improved personal care, tissue and health care products and nonwoven materials.  

       Competitive environmentPast results and future prospects are significantly affected by the competitive environment in which we operate. We experience intense competition for sales of our

 principal products in our major markets, both domestically and internationally. Our products compete with widely-advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices. We have several major competitors in most of our markets, some of which are larger and more diversified. The principal methods and elements of competition include brand recognition and loyalty, product innovation, quality and performance, price, and marketing and distribution capabilities.  

Aggressive competitive actions in 2006 and 2007 have required increased promotional spending to support new product introductions and enable competitive pricing in order to protect the position of the Corporations products in the market. We expect competition to continue to be intense in 2008.  

       Market sharesAchieving leading market shares in our principal products has been an important part of our past performance. We hold number 1 or 2 share positions in more than 80 countries. Achieving and maintaining leading market shares is important because of ongoing consolidation of retailers and the trend of leading merchandisers seeking to stock only the top competitive brands.  

       Cost controlsTo maintain our competitive position, we must control our manufacturing, distribution and other costs. We have achieved cost savings from reducing material costs and manufacturing waste and realizing productivity gains and distribution efficiencies in our business segments. Our ability to control costs can be affected by changes in the price of pulp, oil and other commodities we consume in our manufacturing processes. Our strategic investments in information systems and partnering with third-party providers of administrative services should also allow further cost savings through streamlining administrative activities.  

       Foreign currency and commodity risksAs a multinational enterprise, we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and we are also exposed to changes in commodity prices. Our ability to effectively manage these risks can have a material impact on our results of operations.  

Overview of 2007 Results  

The Corporation experienced significant raw materials cost inflation in 2007, as well as continued competitive pressures.  

       Net sales rose 9.1 percent.  

       Growth was driven by higher sales volumes, favorable currency effects, increased net selling prices and an improved product mix.  

       Operating profit increased 24.5 percent and net income and diluted earnings per share increased 21.6 percent and 25.8 percent, respectively.  

       Higher net sales, lower charges for the strategic cost reduction plan of $377 million and cost savings of about $265 million overcame the effects of about $350 million of cost inflation and a $50 million increase in strategic marketing expense.  

       Cash flow from operations was $2.4 billion, a decrease of 5.8 percent.  

       The Corporation returned $3.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  

Results of Operations and Related Information  

This section contains a discussion and analysis of net sales, operating profit and other information relevant to an understanding of 2007 results of operations. This discussion and analysis compares 2007 results to 2006, and 2006 results to 2005. Each discussion focuses first on consolidated results, and then the results of each reportable business segment.

Commentary:   

2007 versus 2006  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Consolidated net sales increased 9.1 percent from 2006. Sales volumes rose 4 percent, driven by growth in the personal care and K-C Professional & Other segments. Net selling prices increased 1 percent primarily on higher net selling prices for consumer tissue. Favorable currency effects, primarily in Europe, Australia and Brazil, and improved product mix added about 3 percent and 1 percent, respectively, to the increase.

PART II  

(Continued)  

       Worldwide net sales of personal care products increased 12.2 percent due to higher sales volumes, favorable currency effects and improved product mix, while net selling prices remained about the same as last year. Each of the regions contributed to the increased sales volumes.  

In North America, net sales increased nearly 8 percent primarily on the strength of increased sales volumes. Product innovations spurred volume growth, with a double-digit gain for Huggies baby wipes, high single-digit growth for Huggies diapers and mid single-digit increases for the Corporations child care and incontinence care brands. Child care sales volumes benefited from the late third quarter introduction of GoodNites Sleep Boxers and Sleep Shorts, a unique offering in the youth pants category. Meanwhile, sales volumes of Kotex feminine care products were below year-ago levels. Net selling prices increased about 1 percent.  

Net sales in Europe increased about 11 percent, principally due to favorable currency effects. Higher sales volumes of more than 2 percent were offset by lower net selling prices. The sales volume gains reflect higher sales of Huggies diapers and baby wipes across the region, including a more than 2 percent volume gain for Huggies diapers in the four core marketsUnited Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain. The lower net selling prices were due to meeting competitive promotional activity.  

In the developing and emerging markets, net sales increased nearly 21 percent driven by a more than 13 percent increase in sales volumes. The growth in sales volumes was broad-based, with particular strength throughout most of Latin America and in South Korea, China and Russia. Favorable currency effects, primarily in Australia and Brazil, added about 6 percent to the higher net sales while net selling prices were about even with last year.  

       Worldwide net sales of consumer tissue products increased 8.2 percent with about half the gain coming from favorable currency effects, primarily in Europe, Australia and Brazil. Higher net selling prices, principally in North America and the developing and emerging markets, added 2 percent to the higher net sales while higher sales volumes and favorable product mix each contributed about 1 percent.  

In North America, net sales rose more than 5 percent due to nearly 3 percent higher sales volumes and about 2 percent higher net selling prices. Sales volumes for bathroom tissue and paper towels increased 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, on growth for Scott bathroom tissue and Viva paper towels reflecting product improvements for these brands. Net selling prices were impacted by promotional activity, late in the year, in support of product upgrades, including the Corporations improved Cottonelle bathroom tissue, as well as to support facial tissue in anticipation of a seasonal pick-up in sales volumes that had not yet occurred because of a weaker cold and flu season in the fourth quarter of 2007.  

In Europe, net sales increased approximately 9 percent, principally due to favorable currency exchange rates. Improved product mix was negated by an overall sales volume decline of about 1 percent that resulted from the Corporations 2006 decision to shed low-margin business following the sale or closure of certain facilities in the region. Sales volume increases for Andrex bathroom tissue and Kleenex facial tissue were not sufficient to offset the withdrawal from the low-margin business. Net selling prices remained about the same as in the prior year.  

In the developing and emerging markets, net sales increased more than 12 percent. About half of the increase was due to favorable currency effects. Improved product mix of nearly 3 percent was tempered by lower sales volumes of slightly more than 1 percent. Net selling prices increased almost 5 percent as selling prices were raised during the year in most developing and emerging markets in response to higher raw material costs.  

       Worldwide net sales of K-C Professional & Other products increased 8.0 percent. Sales volumes increased more than 3 percent with double-digit growth in Latin America and 4 percent higher sales   

20

(Continued)  

 volumes in North America led by advances for Kleenex, Scott and Cottonelle washroom brands and Kimtech and WypAll wiper brands. Higher net selling prices added about 1 percent to the increase in net sales and favorable currency effects contributed over 3 percent.  

       Worldwide net sales of health care products declined about 2.5 percent. Improved product mix of about 1 percent and favorable currency effects of the same magnitude partially offset a decline in sales volumes of about 5 percent. The decrease in sales volumes was mainly attributable to a higher level of sales of face masks last year primarily due to avian flu preparedness and the impact of the Corporations decision in the second half of 2006 to exit the latex exam glove business. During 2007, the Corporation made progress in transitioning customers and users from latex to its higher-margin, clinically-preferred nitrile gloves. Sales of exam gloves improved sequentially in the fourth quarter of 2007 versus the third quarter 2007 levels. Nevertheless, the growth in sales of nitrile gloves did not compensate for the drop-off in sales of latex gloves, due in part to supply constraints earlier in 2007 and competitive market conditions. In other areas of the business, sales of medical devices, particularly Ballard respiratory catheters, generated high single-digit improvement.  

2006 versus 2005  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Consolidated net sales increased 5.3 percent from 2005. Sales volumes rose more than 2 percent, driven by growth in the personal care and health care segments. Net selling prices increased more than 1 percent, as higher net selling prices for consumer tissue were partially offset by lower net selling prices for personal care. Favorable currency effects, primarily in Korea and Brazil, and improved product mix each added about 1 percent.  

       Worldwide net sales of personal care products increased 7.2 percent due to higher sales volumes, with each of the regions contributing to the increase, favorable currency effects and improved product mix, partially offset by lower net selling prices.  

In North America, net sales increased about 4 percent principally resulting from higher sales volumes for disposable diapers, continued growth in child care productsGoodNites youth pants and Pull-Ups training pantsHuggies baby wipes and incontinence care products, partially offset by continued lower feminine care sales volumes. Lower net selling prices of about 1 percent due to competitive pressures were partially offset by a favorable Canadian dollar currency effect.  

Net sales in Europe were even with the prior year as higher sales volumes were offset by lower net selling prices. Increased sales volumes, primarily for disposable diapers, were tempered by lower sales volumes for feminine care products.  

In the developing and emerging markets, net sales grew 14 percent with each of the regions contributing to the increase. The overall increase was driven by more than 9 percent higher sales volumes reflecting double-digit growth in Latin America and the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe. Favorable product mix, led by results in Korea, and favorable currency effects, primarily in Korea and Brazil, each added about 2 percent to the net sales gain.

(Continued)  

       Worldwide net sales of consumer tissue products increased 3.5 percent primarily due to higher net selling prices in each geographic region.  

In North America, net sales were nearly 4 percent higher principally due to increased net selling prices as the benefit of improved product mix was partially offset by lower sales volumes. The higher net selling prices resulted from price increases in February 2006 on bathroom tissue and towels, and a price increase in April 2006 for facial tissue. The price increases were tempered by higher promotional spending.  

In Europe, net sales declined about 1 percent because higher net selling prices and favorable product mix did not offset lower sales volumes. The lower sales volumes were due, in part, to the strategy of exiting low margin businesses.  

In the developing and emerging markets, net sales advanced about 9 percent. Sales volumes increased more than 1 percent, net selling prices rose nearly 4 percent and favorable product mix and currency each added nearly 2 percent. Each of the regions contributed to the higher net selling prices, and Korea and Brazil provided the most significant currency gains.  

       Worldwide net sales of K-C Professional & Other products increased 5.3 percent due to 2 percent higher net selling prices, while sales volumes, favorable product mix and currency each added about 1 percent. North America led the higher net selling prices due to several contract price increases over the last two years.  

       Worldwide net sales of health care products rose 7.6 percent on the strength of nearly 6 percent higher sales volumes. The sales volume growth reflects gains for face masks, sterilization wrap and the new Sterling Nitrile exam glove. Higher net selling prices and favorable product mix each contributed about 1 percent to the increase.

 (a) Includes the benefit of cost savings achieved, net of higher marketing and general expenses.  

 (b) Charges for strategic cost reductions were $377.2 million lower in 2007 than in 2006.  

Consolidated operating profit increased $514.9 million or 24.5 percent. Lower charges for the Strategic Cost Reduction Plan (the Plan) increased operating profit by $377.2 million. These charges, as discussed later in this MD&A and in Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are not included in the business segments. In addition, cost savings generated by the Plan totaled approximately $105 million during 2007. Other factors affecting the comparison with 2006 were savings of nearly $160 million for the Corporations Focused On Reducing Costs Everywhere program, higher sales volumes and increased net selling prices. Partially offsetting these improvements were raw materials cost inflation of almost $350 million, increased strategic marketing expenses of about $50 million and higher general and administrative expenses. The increased general and administrative expenses were to a large extent in support of growth in the developing and emerging markets. Operating profit as a percent of net sales increased to 14.3 percent from 12.5 percent in 2006.

(Continued)  

       Operating profit for personal care products increased 20.0 percent. Cost savings and higher sales volumes more than offset raw materials cost inflation, the costs for product improvements and increased general and administrative expenses.  

Operating profit in North America increased nearly 13 percent primarily on the strength of higher sales volumes. Cost savings and slightly higher net selling prices offset the effect of raw materials cost inflation. Increased operating profit in Europe was driven by cost savings and higher sales volumes, despite lower net selling prices. Operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased more than 25 percent on sales volume growth and cost savings that more than offset increased marketing and general and administrative expenses.  

       Operating profit for consumer tissue products decreased 9.1 percent as higher net selling prices and cost savings were more than offset by raw materials cost inflation, the costs for product improvements and higher manufacturing costs.  

In North America, operating profit declined more than 15 percent because higher net selling prices were more than offset by raw materials cost inflation, primarily pulp costs, the costs of product improvements and higher manufacturing costs. Operating profit in Europe increased due to cost savings and favorable currency effects tempered by raw materials cost inflation and higher marketing and general and administrative expenses. In the developing and emerging markets, operating profit declined slightly as net selling price gains were more than offset by increased pulp costs, higher manufacturing costs and increased general and administrative expenses.  

       Operating profit for K-C Professional & Other products increased 1.3 percent because higher sales volumes, increased net selling prices and cost savings were substantially negated by cost inflation for both virgin fiber and wastepaper.  

       Operating profit for health care products decreased 7.7 percent as the benefits of cost savings and favorable currency effects were more than offset by raw materials cost inflation, primarily for nonwovens, and increased distribution and selling expenses.  

Strategic Cost Reduction Plan  

During 2007, the Corporation continued to make progress implementing the Strategic Cost Reduction Plan that supports the targeted growth initiatives announced in July 2005. As previously disclosed, management expects this plan to reduce costs by streamlining manufacturing and administrative operations, primarily in North America and Europe, creating a more competitive platform for growth and margin improvement.  

Pretax charges totaling $107.2 million, $484.4 million and $228.6 million for these cost reduction initiatives ($61.4 million, $345.0 million and $167.6 million after tax) were recorded in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. See Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the detail of the costs recorded by year.  

Based on current estimates, the strategic cost reductions are expected to result in cumulative charges of approximately $880 million to $910 million before tax ($610$630 million after tax) by the end of 2008. The change in estimate from the previous range of $950 million to $1.0 billion is primarily due to reduced severances because of higher attrition, as well as higher than anticipated proceeds from asset sales. The Corporation expects the Plan will yield anticipated annual pretax savings of at least $350 million by 2009. Continuous productivity gains over the last several years along with investments in state-of-the-art manufacturing capacity are enabling the Corporation to consolidate production at fewer facilities. Cash costs related to the sale, closure or streamlining of operations, relocation of equipment, severance and other expenses are expected to account for approximately 35 percent of the charges. Noncash charges consist primarily of incremental depreciation and amortization and asset impairments and write-offs.

PART II  

(Continued)  

By the end of 2008, management anticipates there will be a net workforce reduction of about 10 percent, or approximately 6,000 employees. As of December 31, 2007, a net workforce reduction of approximately 4,700 had occurred. Approximately 24 manufacturing facilities, or 17 percent of the Corporations worldwide total, are expected to be sold, closed or streamlined. There is a particular focus on Europe, aimed at improving business results in the region. The Corporation intends to continue to consolidate and streamline manufacturing facilities, further improve operating efficiencies, and reduce selling, general and administrative expenses while reinvesting in key growth opportunities there. As of December 31, 2007, charges have been recorded related to the cost reduction initiatives for 23 facilities.  

The strategic cost reductions are corporate decisions and are not included in the business segments operating profit performance. See Item 8, Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the 2007, 2006 and 2005 costs of the strategic cost reductions by business segment and geographic area.  

Other income and (expense), net  

Other income and (expense), net for 2007 includes a gain of $16.4 million for the settlement of litigation related to prior years operations in Latin America. Currency transaction losses included in this line item were about $10 million lower in 2007 than in 2006. In addition, gains on dispositions of facilities in 2007, as part of the Strategic Cost Reduction Plan, were about $14 million compared with costs of $8 million in 2006.

 (a) Includes the benefit of cost savings achieved, net of higher marketing and general expenses.  

 (b) Charges for strategic cost reductions were $255.8 million higher in 2006 than in 2005.  

Consolidated operating profit declined 9.0 percent or $209.1 million. Primary factors that affected the comparison were approximately $256 million of higher charges in 2006 for the Strategic Cost Reduction Plan that are not included in the business segments (as previously discussed in this MD&A and in Item 8, Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), cost inflation of about $385 million and higher marketing, research and general expenses. Partially offsetting those factors were gross cost savings of about $265 million, higher net selling prices and increased sales volumes. As discussed in Item 8, Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123R). Stock option expense, under the provisions of SFAS 123R, reduced 2006 operating profit by about $35 million. Operating profit as a percent of net sales declined to 12.5 percent from 14.5 percent in 2005.  

       Operating profit for personal care products increased 4.9 percent. Cost savings and higher sales volumes more than offset raw material cost inflationprimarily for polymer resins and superabsorbentsand lower net selling prices.

PART II  

(Continued)  

Operating profit in North America was even with 2005 as higher sales volumes and cost savings were offset by lower net selling prices, materials cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs partly related to product improvements. In Europe, operating results improved due to higher sales volumes, cost savings and lower marketing, research and general expenses. Operating profit in the developing and emerging markets increased more than 10 percent primarily due to increased sales volumes and improved product mix, tempered by increased marketing expenses.  

       Operating profit for consumer tissue products decreased 4.1 percent as higher net selling prices were more than offset by cost inflation, primarily for pulp, increased energy and distribution expenses and higher marketing, research and general expenses.  

In North America, operating profit declined nearly 3 percent due to higher pulp, energy, distribution, manufacturing and start-up costs that more than offset higher net selling prices. Operating profit in Europe decreased as higher pulp and energy costs and increased manufacturing expenses more than offset higher net selling prices and cost savings. In the developing and emerging markets, operating profit declined as higher pulp, distribution and marketing, research and general expenses more than offset the increased net selling prices.  

       Operating profit for K-C Professional & Other products declined .1 percent because higher pulp, energy and distribution costs and increased marketing, research and general expenses more than offset higher net selling prices and cost savings.  

       Operating profit for health care products increased 5.4 percent. The higher sales volumes, favorable product mix and cost savings combined to more than offset raw materials inflation and higher general expenses.  

Other income and (expense), net  

Other income and (expense), net increased by $5.1 million in 2006. While currency transaction losses were lower in 2006 than the prior year, 2005 included income of approximately $22 million from an insurance claim for partial recovery of damages related to a fire in 2004 at a facility in Europe. Also included in 2006 are the previously mentioned costs of $8.0 million for facilities disposed of as part of the strategic cost reduction plan.  

Additional Income Statement Commentary  

Synthetic Fuel Partnerships  

As described in Item 8, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation owns minority interests in two synthetic fuel partnerships. Pretax losses from participation in these partnerships are reported as nonoperating expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. The lower level of losses in 2007 and 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to the partnerships reducing operations in anticipation of the phase-out of related income tax credits as the price of crude oil increased during both 2007 and 2006. The Corporations income tax provision was reduced by $80.5 million in 2007, compared with $86.0 million in 2006 resulting from the income tax credits and tax benefits of these investments. The Corporations income tax provision in 2006 was $148.3 million higher as a result of decreased income tax credits and tax benefits compared with 2005. Diluted earnings per share benefited by $.03 in 2007 compared with $.04 and $.12 in 2006 and 2005, respectively, from the synthetic fuel investments.  

2007 versus 2006  

       Interest expense increased principally due to a higher average level of debt. See Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on debt issued in the third quarter of 2007.  

26  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

       The Corporations effective income tax rate was 23.1 percent for 2007 compared with 25.4 percent in 2006. The decrease for 2007 was primarily due to favorable settlements of tax issues related to prior years and the reversal of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets at certain majority-owned subsidiaries in Latin America based on a sustained improvement in the subsidiaries operating results partially offset by lower foreign tax credit benefits in 2007.  

       The Corporations share of net income from equity companies decreased $48.6 million primarily due to lower net income at Kimberly-Clark de Mexico, S.A.B. de C.V. (KCM). Included in 2006 results was a gain of $45.6 million from the sale by KCM of its pulp and paper business. The remainder of the decline was due to lower operating profit at KCM as net sales growth did not overcome the effect of higher raw materials costs.  

       Minority owners share of subsidiaries net income increased $33.3 million primarily due to the minority owners share of the above-mentioned tax benefits at majority-owned subsidiaries.  

       As a result of the Corporations share repurchase program, including the Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) program, the average number of common shares outstanding declined, which benefited 2007 net income by $.14 per share. This benefit was mostly offset by the higher interest expense associated with the third quarter 2007 debt issuances that funded the ASR. See Item 8, Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on the ASR.  

2006 versus 2005  

       Interest expense increased primarily due to higher average interest rates.  

       The Corporations effective tax rate was 25.4 percent in 2006 compared with 22.3 percent in 2005 primarily due to the reduced benefits from the synthetic fuel partnerships discussed above.  

       The Corporations share of net income of equity companies increased $82.0 million including the $45.6 million gain from the sale of KCMs pulp and paper business in the fourth quarter of 2006. The remainder of the increase was driven by continued double-digit profit growth for KCMs consumer business as well as lower currency transaction losses at KCM compared with 2005.  

       Minority owners share of subsidiaries net income increased $8.3 million primarily because of higher earnings of companies in the developing and emerging markets.  

       As a result of the Corporations share repurchase program, the average number of common shares outstanding declined, which benefited 2006 net income by $.11 per share.

Cash Flow Commentary:  

Cash provided by operations decreased $150.6 million in 2007 compared with 2006. Included in 2006 was a special dividend of $123 million from KCM, and the balance of the decrease was primarily due to a higher investment in working capital.  

Contractual Obligations:  

The following table presents the Corporations total contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed or determinable.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Obligations Commentary:  

       Projected interest payments for variable-rate debt were calculated based on the outstanding principal amounts and prevailing market rates as of December 31, 2007.  

       The unconditional purchase obligations are for the purchase of raw materials, primarily pulp and utilities. Although the Corporation is primarily liable for payments on the above operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations, based on historic operating performance and forecasted future cash flows, management believes the Corporations exposure to losses, if any, under these arrangements is not material.  

       The open purchase orders displayed in the table represent amounts the Corporation anticipates will become payable within the next year for goods and services it has negotiated for delivery.  

The above table does not include future payments that the Corporation will make for other postretirement benefit obligations. Those amounts are estimated using actuarial assumptions, including expected future service, to project the future obligations. Based upon those projections, the Corporation anticipates making annual payments for these obligations within a range from more than $85 million in 2008 to more than $100 million by 2017.  

As of December 31, 2007, the Corporation has accrued income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions. These liabilities have not been presented in the table above due to uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments.  

Deferred taxes, minority owners interests and payments related to pension plans are also not included in the table.  

A consolidated financing subsidiary has issued two classes of redeemable preferred securities. The holder of the securities can elect to have the subsidiary redeem the first class in December 2011 and the second class in December 2014 and each 7-year anniversary thereafter. Management currently anticipates that these securities   

28

(Continued)  

 will not be redeemed at the next redemption dates, and therefore they are not included in the above table. In the event that the holder of the securities does elect to have its preferred securities redeemed at the next respective redemption date, the Corporation would be required to pay approximately $500 million in 2011 and approximately $500 million in 2014. See Item 8, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these securities.

       During 2007, the Corporations capital spending of $989.3 million was within the long-term targeted range of 5 percent to 6 percent of net sales. Management believes that this capital spending target range is appropriate.  

       During the first quarter of 2007, the Corporation acquired the remaining 50 percent interest in its Indonesian subsidiary, P.T. Kimberly-Lever Indonesia for $15.7 million. See Item 8, Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail.  

Financing Commentary:  

       At December 31, 2007, total debt and redeemable preferred securities was $6.5 billion compared with $4.4 billion last year end.  

       On July 23, 2007, the Corporation entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ASR Agreement) through which it purchased approximately 29.6 million shares of its common stock from Bank of America, N.A., at an initial purchase price of $67.48 per share, or an aggregate of $2 billion. On July 30, 2007, the Corporation issued $2.1 billion of long-term notes and used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of these notes to repay a short-term revolving credit agreement, under which the Corporation borrowed $2 billion on July 27, 2007 to fund the settlement of the ASR Agreement. See Item 8, Notes 4 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the ASR Agreement.  

       In connection with the new long-term Notes described in Item 8, Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on July 24, 2007, Standard & Poors lowered the Corporations senior unsecured debt rating to A+ with a negative outlook and Moodys Investor Services lowered its rating to A2 with a stable outlook. The Corporations commercial paper rating was lowered by Standard & Poors from A1+ to A1 while it remained unchanged at P1 by Moodys Investor Services.  

       During the fourth quarter of 2006, the Corporation issued $200 million of dealer remarketable securities that have a final maturity in 2016. These securities are classified as current portion of long-term debt as the result of the remarketing provisions of these debt instruments, which require that each year the securities either be remarketed by the dealer or repaid by the Corporation. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Corporation remarketed these securities at an interest rate of 4.42 percent. The proceeds from the sale of the notes in 2006 were used for general corporate purposes and for the reduction of existing indebtedness, including portions of the Corporations outstanding commercial paper program.  

       At December 31, 2007, the Corporation had fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements related to a $500 million 5.0% Note that matures on August 15, 2013.  

       At December 31, 2006, the Corporation had a $1.5 billion unused revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in June 2010. In September 2007, the Corporation renegotiated this facility, maintaining availability at $1.5 billion with a feature that would allow for increasing this facility to $2.0 billion. The previous lender participation structure was substantially unchanged and the cost of the facility was reduced. This facility, which expires in September 2012, remained unused at December 31, 2007. The Corporation anticipates that this facility will be renewed when it expires.

(Continued)  

       For the full year 2007, the Corporation repurchased 41.2 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $2.8 billion, including those in the ASR Agreement and approximately 3.9 million shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of approximately $269 million. The monthly detail of share repurchases for the fourth quarter of 2007 is included in Part II, Item 5 of this Form 10-K.  

       The Corporation has not experienced difficulty in issuing commercial paper in 2008 despite the current constrained credit environment in the United States (U.S.).  

Management believes that the Corporations ability to generate cash from operations and its capacity to issue short-term and long-term debt are adequate to fund working capital, capital spending, payment of dividends, repurchases of common stock and other needs in the foreseeable future.  

Variable Interest Entities  

The Corporation has interests in the following financing and real estate entities and synthetic fuel partnerships described in Item 8, Notes 10, 11 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, all of which are subject to the requirements of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (Revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entitiesan Interpretation of ARB 51 (FIN 46R).  

Financing Entities  

The Corporation holds a significant interest in two financing entities that were used to monetize long-term notes received from the sale of certain nonstrategic timberlands and related assets to nonaffiliated buyers. These transactions qualified for the installment method of accounting for income tax purposes and met the criteria for immediate profit recognition for financial reporting purposes contained in SFAS No. 66, Accounting for Sales of Real Estate. These sales involved notes receivable with an aggregate face value of $617 million and a fair value of approximately $593 million at the date of sale. The notes receivable are backed by irrevocable standby letters of credit issued by money center banks, which aggregated $617 million at December 31, 2007.  

Because the Corporation desired to monetize the $617 million of notes receivable and continue the deferral of current income taxes on the gains, it transferred the notes received from the sales to noncontrolled financing entities. The Corporation has minority voting interests in each of the financing entities (collectively, the Financing Entities). The transfers of the notes and certain other assets to the Financing Entities were made at fair value, were accounted for as asset sales and resulted in no gain or loss. In conjunction with the transfer of the notes and other assets, the Financing Entities became obligated for $617 million in third-party debt financing. A nonaffiliated financial institution has made substantive capital investments in each of the Financing Entities, has majority voting control over them and has substantive risks and rewards of ownership of the assets in the Financing Entities. The Corporation also contributed intercompany notes receivable aggregating $662 million and intercompany preferred stock of $50 million to the Financing Entities, which serve as secondary collateral for the third-party lending arrangements. In the unlikely event of default by both of the money center banks that provided the irrevocable standby letters of credit, the Corporation could experience a maximum loss of $617 million under these arrangements.  

The Corporation has not consolidated the Financing Entities because it is not the primary beneficiary of either entity. Rather, it will continue to account for its ownership interests in these entities using the equity method of accounting. The Corporation retains equity interests in the Financing Entities for which the legal right of offset exists against the intercompany notes. As a result, the intercompany notes payable have been offset against the Corporations equity interests in the Financing Entities for financial reporting purposes.

(Continued)  

See Item 8, Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Corporations Luxembourg-based financing subsidiary, which is consolidated because the Corporation is the primary beneficiary of the entity.  

Real Estate Entities  

The Corporation participates in the U.S. affordable housing and historic renovation real estate markets. Investments in these markets are encouraged by laws enacted by the U.S. Congress and related federal income tax rules and regulations. Accordingly, these investments generate income tax credits and tax losses that are used to reduce the Corporations income tax liabilities. The Corporation invested in these markets through (i) partnership arrangements as a limited partner, (ii) limited liability companies as a nonmanaging member and (iii) investments in various funds in which the Corporation is one of many noncontrolling investors. These entities borrow money from third parties generally on a nonrecourse basis and invest in and own various real estate projects.  

FIN 46R requires the Corporation to consolidate certain real estate entities because it is the primary beneficiary of them. The Corporation also consolidates certain other real estate entities pursuant to SFAS No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries. The assets of these entities classified principally as property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2007, have a carrying amount aggregating $166.4 million that serves as collateral for $117.6 million of obligations of these ventures. Neither the creditors nor the other beneficial interest holders of these consolidated ventures have recourse to the general credit of the Corporation, except for $22.2 million of permanent financing debt, which is guaranteed by the Corporation. As of December 31, 2007, the Corporation has earned income tax credits totaling approximately $88.8 million on its consolidated real estate entities.  

The Corporation accounts for its interests in its nonconsolidated real estate entities by the equity method of accounting or by the effective yield method, as appropriate, and has accounted for the related income tax credits and other tax benefits as a reduction in its income tax provision. As of December 31, 2007, the Corporation had net equity of $14.3 million in its nonconsolidated real estate entities. The Corporation has earned income tax credits totaling approximately $87.5 million on these nonconsolidated real estate entities. As of December 31, 2007, total permanent financing debt for the nonconsolidated entities was $260.9 million. A total of $21.7 million of the permanent financing debt is guaranteed by the Corporation and the remainder of this debt is secured solely by the properties and is nonrecourse to the Corporation. At December 31, 2007, the Corporations maximum loss exposure for its nonconsolidated real estate entities is estimated to be $53.5 million and is comprised of its net equity in these entities of $14.3 million, its permanent financing guarantees of $21.7 million, and the income tax credit recapture risk of $17.5 million.  

If the Corporations investments in all of its real estate entities were to be disposed of at their carrying amounts, a portion of the tax credits may be recaptured and may result in a charge to earnings. As of December 31, 2007, this recapture risk is estimated to be $41.8 million. The Corporation has no current intention of disposing of these investments during the recapture period, nor does it anticipate the need to do so in the foreseeable future in order to satisfy any anticipated liquidity need. Accordingly, the recapture risk is considered to be remote.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the   

31  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 reporting period. The critical accounting policies used by management in the preparation of the Corporations Consolidated Financial Statements are those that are important both to the presentation of the Corporations financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgments by management with regard to estimates used. The critical judgments by management relate to consumer and trade promotion and rebate accruals, pension and other postretirement benefits, retained insurable risks, useful lives for depreciation and amortization, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill and long-lived assets and for determining the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities, deferred income taxes and potential income tax assessments, and loss contingencies. The Corporations critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  

Promotion and Rebate Accruals  

Among those factors affecting the accruals for promotions are estimates of the number of consumer coupons that will be redeemed and the type and number of activities within promotional programs between the Corporation and its trade customers. Rebate accruals are based on estimates of the quantity of products distributors have sold to specific customers. Generally, the estimates for consumer coupon costs are based on historical patterns of coupon redemption, influenced by judgments about current market conditions such as competitive activity in specific product categories. Estimates of trade promotion liabilities for promotional program costs incurred, but unpaid, are generally based on estimates of the quantity of customer sales, timing of promotional activities and forecasted costs for activities within the promotional programs. Settlement of these liabilities sometimes occurs in periods subsequent to the date of the promotion activity. Trade promotion programs include introductory marketing funds such as slotting fees, cooperative marketing programs, temporary price reductions, favorable end-of-aisle or in-store product displays and other activities conducted by the customers to promote the Corporations products. Promotion accruals as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $347.7 million and $296.8 million, respectively. Rebate accruals as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $252.7 million and $214.5 million, respectively.  

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits  

Pension Benefits  

The Corporation and its subsidiaries in North America and the United Kingdom have defined benefit pension plans (the Principal Plans) and/or defined contribution retirement plans covering substantially all regular employees. Certain other subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans or, in certain countries, termination pay plans covering substantially all regular employees. The funding policy for the qualified defined benefit plans in North America and the defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom is to contribute assets to the higher of the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) or regulatory minimum requirements. Subject to regulatory requirements and tax deductibility limits, any funding shortfall will be eliminated over a reasonable number of years.  

Nonqualified U.S. plans providing pension benefits in excess of limitations imposed by the U.S. income tax code are not funded. Funding for the remaining defined benefit plans outside the U.S. is based on legal requirements, tax considerations, investment opportunities, and customary business practices in such countries.  

Consolidated pension expense for defined benefit pension plans was $119.8 million in 2007 compared with $166.9 million for 2006. Pension expense included incremental costs of about $9 million and $11 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, for special pension benefits related to the strategic cost reductions. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions applied to each of the defined benefit plans. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets used to calculate pension expense was   

32  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 8.27 percent in 2007 compared with 8.28 percent in 2006 and will be 8.23 percent in 2008. The expected long- term rate of return on pension fund assets was determined based on projected long-term returns of broad equity and bond indices. The U.S. plans historical 15-year and 20-year compounded annual returns of 10.1 percent and 10.3 percent, respectively, which have been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices, were also considered. On average, the investment managers for each of the plans comprising the Principal Plans are anticipated to generate annual long-term rates of return of at least 8.4 percent. The expected long-term rate of return on the assets in the Principal Plans is based on an asset allocation assumption of about 70 percent with equity managers, with expected long-term rates of return of approximately 10 percent, and about 30 percent with fixed income managers, with an expected long-term rate of return of about 6 percent. Actual asset allocation is regularly reviewed and it is periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Long-term rate of return assumptions continue to be evaluated at least annually and are adjusted as necessary.  

Pension expense is determined using the fair value of assets rather than a calculated value that averages gains and losses (Calculated Value) over a period of years. Investment gains or losses represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the fair value of assets and the actual return based on the fair value of assets. The variance between actual and expected gains and losses on pension assets is recognized in pension expense more rapidly than it would be if a Calculated Value was used for plan assets. As of December 31, 2007, the Principal Plans had cumulative unrecognized investment losses and other actuarial losses of approximately $1.1 billion. These unrecognized net losses may increase future pension expense if not offset by (i) actual investment returns that exceed the assumed investment returns, or (ii) other factors, including reduced pension liabilities arising from higher discount rates used to calculate pension obligations, or (iii) other actuarial gains, including whether such accumulated actuarial losses at each measurement date exceed the corridor determined under SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions.  

The discount (or settlement) rates used to determine the present values of the Corporations future U.S. and Canadian pension obligations at December 31, 2007 were based on yield curves constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with maturities ranging from 1 year to 30 years. Each years expected future benefit payments were discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate thereby generating the overall discount rates for the U.S. and Canadian pension obligations. For the U.K. plans, discount rates are established using a U.K. bond index comprised of high quality corporate debt securities with a duration approximately equal to the pension obligations. The weighted-average discount rate for the Principal Plans increased to 6.20 percent at December 31, 2007 from 5.71 percent at December 31, 2006.  

Consolidated pension expense is estimated to approximate $94 million in 2008. This estimate reflects the effect of the actuarial losses and is based on an expected weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets in the Principal Plans of 8.48 percent, a weighted-average discount rate for the Principal Plans of 6.20 percent and various other assumptions. Pension expense beyond 2008 will depend on future investment performance, the Corporations contributions to the pension trusts, changes in discount rates and various other factors related to the covered employees in the plans.  

If the expected long-term rates of return on assets for the Principal Plans were lowered by 0.25 percent, our annual pension expense would increase by approximately $11 million. If the discount rate assumptions for these same plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, annual pension expense would increase by approximately $13 million and the December 31, 2007 pension liability would increase by about $157 million.  

The fair value of the assets in the Corporations defined benefit plans was $4.7 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. The projected benefit obligations of the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by approximately $.8 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. On a consolidated basis, the Corporation contributed about   

33  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 $98 million to pension trusts in 2007 compared with $132 million in 2006. In addition, the Corporation made direct benefit payments of $14.8 million in 2007 compared to $12.8 million in 2006. While the Corporation is not required to make a contribution in 2008 to the U.S. plan, the benefit of a contribution will be evaluated. The Corporation currently anticipates contributing about $82 million to its pension plans outside the U.S. in 2008.  

The discount rate used for each countrys pension obligation is similar to the discount rate used for that countrys other postretirement obligation. The discount rates displayed for the two types of obligations for the Corporations consolidated operations may appear different due to the weighting used in the calculation of the two weighted-average discount rates.  

Other Postretirement Benefits  

Substantially all U.S. retirees and employees are covered by unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plans. Certain benefits are based on years of service and/or age at retirement. The plans are principally noncontributory for employees who were eligible to retire before 1993 and contributory for most employees who retire after 1992, except that the Corporation provides no subsidized benefits to most employees hired after 2003.  

The Corporation made benefit payments of $76.6 million in 2007 compared with $75.8 million in 2006. The determination of the discount rates used to calculate the benefit obligations of the plans is discussed in the pension benefit section above. If the discount rate assumptions for these plans were reduced by 0.25 percent, 2008 other postretirement benefit expense would increase by approximately $1 million and the December 31, 2007 benefit liability would increase by about $19 million.  

The health care cost trend rate is based on a combination of inputs including the Corporations recent claims history and insights from external advisers regarding recent developments in the health care marketplace, as well as projections of future trends in the marketplace. The annual increase in the consolidated weighted-average health care cost trend rate is expected to be 8.44 percent in 2008, 7.46 percent in 2009 and to gradually decline to 5.21 percent in 2020 and thereafter. See Item 8, Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of the effect of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate.  

Retained Insurable Risks  

Selected insurable risks are retained, primarily those related to property damage, workers compensation, and product, automobile and premises liability based upon historical loss patterns and managements judgment of cost effective risk retention. Accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported events, principally related to workers compensation and automobile liability, are based upon undiscounted loss development factors.  

Property and Depreciation  

Estimating the useful lives of property, plant and equipment requires the exercise of management judgment, and actual lives may differ from these estimates. Changes to these initial useful life estimates are made when appropriate. Property, plant and equipment are tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such long-lived assets may not be recoverable from future net pretax cash flows. Impairment testing requires significant management judgment including estimating the future success of product lines, future sales volumes, growth rates for selling prices and costs, alternative uses for the assets and estimated proceeds from disposal of the assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured and are independent of cash flows of other assets. An asset impairment would be   

34  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 indicated if the sum of the expected future net pretax cash flows from the use of the asset (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset. An impairment loss would be measured based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount. The determination of fair value is based on an expected present value technique in which multiple probability-weighted cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes and a risk-free rate of interest are used to estimate fair value.  

The estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analysis are consistent with the business plans, including the Strategic Cost Reduction Plan, and estimates used to manage business operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions. The use of different assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of the asset and the impairment charge. Actual outcomes may differ from the estimates. For example, if the Corporations products fail to achieve volume and pricing estimates or if market conditions change or other significant estimates are not realized, then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved, and additional impairment charges may be recognized.  

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

The carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually as of the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed in accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Impairment testing is conducted at the operating segment level of the Corporations businesses and is based on a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of each operating segment. The determination of fair value requires significant management judgment including estimating future sales volumes, selling prices and costs, changes in working capital, investments in property and equipment and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Sensitivities of these fair value estimates to changes in assumptions for sales volumes, selling prices and costs are also tested. If the carrying amount of an operating segment that contains goodwill exceeds fair value, a possible impairment would be indicated. If a possible impairment is indicated, the implied fair value of goodwill would be estimated by comparing the fair value of the net assets of the unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value of the unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded. Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually. Factors such as unexpected adverse economic conditions, competition, product changes and other external events may require more frequent assessments. The Corporations annual goodwill impairment testing has been completed and it has been determined that its $2.9 billion of goodwill is not impaired.  

The Corporation has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. At December 31, 2007, the Corporation has other intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of approximately $308 million and a net carrying amount of about $132 million. These intangibles are being amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss would be indicated. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value (based on discounted future cash flows). Judgment is used in assessing whether the carrying amount of intangible assets is not expected to be recoverable over their estimated remaining useful lives. The factors considered are similar to those outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above.  

Primary Beneficiary Determination of Variable Interest Entities (VIE)  

The determination of the primary beneficiary of variable interest entities under FIN 46R requires estimating the probable future cash flows of each VIE using a computer simulation model and determining the variability of such cash flows and their present values. Estimating the probable future cash flows of each VIE requires the   

35  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 exercise of significant management judgment. The resulting present values are then allocated to the various participants in each VIE in accordance with their beneficial interests. The participant that is allocated the majority of the present value of the variability is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE under FIN 46R.  

Deferred Income Taxes and Potential Assessments  

As of December 31, 2007, the Corporation had recorded deferred tax assets related to income tax loss carryforwards, income tax credit carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards totaling $718.0 million and had established valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets of $304.5 million, thereby resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $413.5 million. As of December 31, 2006, the net deferred tax asset was $409.1 million. These carryforwards are primarily in non-U.S. taxing jurisdictions and in certain states in the U.S. Foreign tax credits earned in the U.S. in current and prior years, which cannot be used currently, also give rise to net deferred tax assets. In determining the valuation allowances to establish against these deferred tax assets, the Corporation considers many factors, including the specific taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward period, income tax strategies and forecasted earnings for the entities in each jurisdiction. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, the Corporation concludes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  

As of December 31, 2007, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 23, Accounting for Income Taxes, Special Areas, U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on approximately $4.4 billion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. These earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely. However, they would be subject to income tax if they were remitted as dividends, were lent to the Corporation or a U.S. affiliate, or if the Corporation were to sell its stock in the subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. income tax liability on these unremitted earnings. We periodically determine whether our non-U.S. subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassess this determination as appropriate. See Item 8, Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of previously unremitted earnings that were repatriated in 2005 under the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act.  

The Corporation accrues net liabilities for current income taxes for potential assessments, which at December 31, 2007 and January 1, 2007 were $322.6 million and $388.7 million, respectively. The accruals relate to uncertain tax positions in a variety of taxing jurisdictions and are based on what management believes will be the resolution of these positions, in accordance with the provisions of FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. These liabilities may be affected by changing interpretations of laws, rulings by tax authorities, or the expiration of the statute of limitations. The Corporations U.S. federal income tax returns have been audited through 2003. IRS assessments of additional taxes have been paid through 2001. Refund actions are pending with the IRS Appeals Office for the years 2002 and 2003. Management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material effect on the Corporations business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  

Loss Contingencies  

The outcome of loss contingencies and legal proceedings and claims brought against the Corporation is subject to uncertainty. SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, requires that an estimated loss contingency be accrued by a charge to earnings if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Disclosure of the contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred. Determination of whether to accrue a loss requires evaluation   

36  

Table of Contents 

PART II  

(Continued)  

 of the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate. Changes in these estimates could affect the timing and amount of accrual of loss contingencies.  

Legal Matters  

The Corporation has been named a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or analogous state statutes, at a number of waste disposal sites, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, in managements opinion, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the Corporations business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  

New Accounting Standards  

See Item 8, Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of new accounting standards and their anticipated effects on the Corporations financial statements.  

Business Outlook  

Based on the strength of its business results throughout 2007, in the face of significant inflationary pressures, the Corporation is confident that it will continue to execute its Global Business Plan in 2008. The Corporation expects top-line growth in 2008, consistent with its long-term objectives as it builds on momentum in the personal care segment and developing and emerging markets and successfully drives its other targeted growth initiatives. The Corporation intends to continue to aggressively reduce costs and will strive to improve results in businesses that have been most significantly impacted by cost inflation. At the same time, the Corporation will invest more to further strengthen key capabilities in innovation, marketing and customer developmentinvestments that will help it deliver sustainable growth. Finally, the Corporation will remain focused on increasing cash flow and deploying it in shareholder-friendly ways.  

Forward-Looking Statements  

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K or related documents, a portion of which are incorporated herein by reference, concerning, among other things, the business outlook, including new product introductions, cost savings, anticipated costs and benefits related to the Strategic Cost Reduction Plan, anticipated benefits from the ASR program, anticipated financial and operating results, strategies, contingencies and anticipated transactions of the Corporation, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based upon managements expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the Corporation. There can be no assurance that these events will occur or that the Corporations results will be as estimated.  

The assumptions used as a basis for the forward-looking statements include many estimates that, among other things, depend on the achievement of future cost savings and projected volume increases. In addition, many factors outside the control of the Corporation, including the prices and availability of the Corporations raw materials, potential competitive pressures on selling prices or advertising and promotion expenses for the Corporations products, energy costs, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as general economic conditions in the markets in which the Corporation does business, could impact the realization of such estimates.  

The factors described under Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10-K, or in our other Securities and Exchange Commission filings, among others, could cause the Corporations future results to differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Corporation. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently consider immaterial could also affect our business operations and financial results.
