Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

 We are exposed to potential fluctuations in earnings, cash flows, and the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. To manage the risk from these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative instruments. We do not enter into derivatives or financial instruments for trading purposes.  

 The following discussion describes our specific exposures and the strategies we use to manage these risks. See Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and derivatives.  

 We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk from translating the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars. Our primary exposures are to the British pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar. We use over-the-counter (OTC) options and forward

contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations' financial statements.  

 Additionally, some of our foreign brokerage subsidiaries receive revenues in currencies that differ from their functional currencies. Our U.K. subsidiary earns approximately 48% of its revenue in U.S. dollars and 15% of its revenue in Euros, but most of its expenses are incurred in pounds sterling. Our policy is to convert into pounds sterling sufficient U.S. dollar and Euro revenue to fund the subsidiary's pound sterling expenses using OTC options and forward exchange contracts. At December 31, 2008, we have hedged 24% and 32% of our U.K. subsidiaries' expected U.S. dollar transaction exposure for the years ending December 31, 2009 and 2010, respectively. In addition, we have hedged 37% and 25% of our U.K. subsidiaries' expected Euro transaction exposures for the same time periods. We do not generally hedge exposures beyond three years.  

 We also use forward contracts to offset foreign exchange risk associated with foreign denominated inter-company notes.  

 The potential loss in future earnings from market risk sensitive instruments resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in year-end exchange rates would not be material in 2009 and 2010.  

 Our businesses' income is affected by changes in international and domestic short-term interest rates. We monitor our net exposure to short-term interest rates and as appropriate, hedge our exposure with various derivative financial instruments. This activity primarily relates to brokerage funds held on behalf of clients in the U.S. and on the continent of Europe. A hypothetical, instantaneous parallel increase (decrease) in the period end yield curve of 100 basis points would cause an increase (decrease), net of derivative positions, of $40 million and $48 million to 2009 and 2010 pretax income, respectively.  

 We have debt outstanding with a fair market value of $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion at December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively. This fair value was less than the carrying value by $299 million at December 31, 2008, and $27 million greater than the carrying value at December 31, 2007. The year over year fair value decrease was driven by significant increases in credit spreads, particularly spreads on preferred capital securities. A hypothetical 1% increase (decrease) in interest rates would decrease (increase) the fair value by approximately 3% and 4% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 PEPS I Â— At December 31, 2008, a 10% or 20% decrease in the underlying equity of the limited partnerships would have decreased the value of the preferred stock securities by $9 million and $19 million, respectively.  

 We have selected hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity market prices to illustrate the possible impact of these changes; we are not predicting market events. We believe these changes in rates and prices are reasonably possible within a one-year period.
