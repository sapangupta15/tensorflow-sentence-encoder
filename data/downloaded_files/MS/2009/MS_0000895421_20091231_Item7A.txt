Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

Risk Management.  

Risk Management Policy and Control Structure.  

Risk is an inherent part of the Companys business and activities. The Company has policies and procedures in place for measuring, monitoring and managing each of the various types of significant risks involved in the activities of its Institutional Securities, Global Wealth Management Group and Asset Management business segments and support functions as well as at the holding company level. The Companys ability to properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in its activities is critical to its soundness and profitability. The Companys portfolio of business activities helps reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its net revenues as a whole. The Company seeks to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks involved in the Companys business activities: market, credit, capital and liquidity, operational and compliance and legal risk. Capital and liquidity risk is discussed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7. The Companys currency exposure relating to its net monetary investments in non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries is discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.  

The cornerstone of the Companys risk management philosophy is the execution of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk-taking that protects the Companys capital base and franchise. The Companys risk management philosophy is based on the following principles: comprehensiveness, independence, accountability, defined risk tolerance and transparency. Given the importance of effective risk management to the Companys reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequent communication and appropriate escalation of risk matters.  

Risk management at the Company requires independent Company-level oversight, accountability of the Companys business segments, constant communication, judgment, and knowledge of specialized products and markets. The Companys senior management takes an active role in the identification, assessment and management of various risks at both the Company and business segments level. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the global financial services business, the Companys risk management philosophy, with its attendant policies, procedures and methodologies, is evolutionary in nature and subject to ongoing review and modification.  

The nature of the Companys risks, coupled with this risk management philosophy, informs the Companys risk governance structure. The Companys risk governance structure includes the Board; the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board; the FRC; senior management oversight, including the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Legal Officer and the Chief Compliance Officer; the Internal Audit Department; independent risk management functions (including the Market Risk Department, Credit Risk Management, the Corporate Treasury Department and the Operational Risk Department) and Company control groups (including the Human Resources Department, the Legal and Compliance Division, the Tax Department and the Financial Control Group), and various other risk control managers, committees and groups located within and across the Companys business segments.  

The Board has oversight for the Companys enterprise risk management framework and is responsible for helping to ensure that the Companys risks are managed in a sound manner. Historically, the Board had authorized the Audit Committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors, to oversee risk management. Effective January 1, 2010, the Board established another standing committee, the Risk Committee, which is comprised solely of non-management directors, to assist the Board in the oversight of (i) the Companys risk governance structure, (ii) the Companys risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies regarding market, credit and liquidity and funding risk, (iii) the Companys risk tolerance and (iv) the

 performance of the Chief Risk Officer. The Audit Committee continues to review the major operational, franchise, reputational, legal and compliance risk exposures of the Company and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposure. The Risk Committee, Audit Committee and Chief Risk Officer report to the full Board on a regular basis.  

The Board has also authorized the FRC, a management committee appointed and chaired by the Chief Executive Officer that includes the most senior officers of the Company, including the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to oversee the Companys global risk management structure. The FRCs responsibilities include oversight of the Companys risk management principles, procedures and limits, and the monitoring of capital levels and material market, credit, liquidity and funding, legal, operational, franchise and regulatory risk matters and other risks, as appropriate, and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage such risks. The FRC reports to the full Board, the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee through the Companys Chief Risk Officer.  

The Chief Risk Officer, a member of the FRC who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, oversees compliance with Company risk limits; approves certain excessions of Company risk limits; reviews material market, credit and operational risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Board, the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee, as appropriate.  

The Internal Audit Department provides independent risk and control assessment and reports to the Audit Committee and administratively to the Chief Legal Officer. The Internal Audit Department examines the Companys operational and control environment and conducts audits designed to cover all major risk categories.  

The risk management functions and the Company control groups are independent of the Companys business units, assist senior management and the FRC in monitoring and controlling the Companys risk through a number of control processes. The Company is committed to employing qualified personnel with appropriate expertise in each of its various administrative and business areas to implement effectively the Companys risk management and monitoring systems and processes.  

Each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for helping to ensure that the business segment, as applicable, adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies and procedures that are consistent with the risk framework established by the FRC; and reviews, on a periodic basis, its aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of its risk identification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures, and related controls.  

Each of the Companys business segments also has designated operations officers, committees and groups to manage and monitor specific risks and report to the business segment risk committee. The Company control groups work with business segment control groups (including the Operations Division and Information Technology Division) to review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, the business segments market, credit and operational risk profile, sales practices, reputation, legal enforceability, and operational and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Company and business segment control groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo a thorough review.  

The following is a discussion of the Companys risk management policies and procedures for its principal risks (other than capital and liquidity risk). The discussion focuses on the Companys securities activities (primarily its institutional trading activities) and corporate lending and related activities. The Company believes that these activities generate a substantial portion of its principal risks. This discussion and the estimated amounts of the Companys market risk exposure generated by the Companys statistical analyses are forward-looking statements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which the Company operates and certain other factors described below.

Market Risk.  

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, the Company incurs market risk as a result of trading and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business where the substantial majority of the Companys VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, the Company incurs trading-related market risk within the Global Wealth Management Group. Asset Management incurs non-trading market risk primarily from capital investments in real estate funds and investments in private equity vehicles.  

Sound market risk management is an integral part of the Companys culture. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. The control groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible for ensuring transparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department monitors the Companys risk against limits on aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk summaries, and maintains the Companys VaR system. Limits are designed to control price and market liquidity risk. Market risk is monitored through various measures: statistically (using VaR and related analytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and through routine stress testing and scenario analyses conducted by the Market Risk Department in collaboration with the business units. The material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Market Risk Department that are circulated to and discussed with senior management, the Risk Committee and the Board.  

Risk and Capital Management Initiatives.  

During 2009, the Company continued to enhance its market risk management framework to address the severe stresses observed in global markets during the recent economic downturn (see Executive SummaryGlobal Market and Economic Conditions in Fiscal 2009 Part II, Item 7, herein). The Company expanded and improved its risk measurement processes, including stress tests and scenario analysis, and refined its market risk limit framework. In conjunction with these risk measurement enhancements, a proprietary methodology called Stress VaR (S-VaR) was developed to comprehensively measure the Companys market and credit risks. S-VaR simulates many stress scenarios based on more than 25 years of historical data and attempts to capture the different liquidities of various types of general and specific risks, as well as event and default risks particularly relevant for credit portfolios. S-VaR, while still evolving, is becoming an important metric for the Companys risk appetite assessment and its capital allocation framework.  

Sales and Trading and Related Activities.  

Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk Management. During 2009, the Company had exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity pricesand the associated implied volatilities and spreadsrelated to the global markets in which it conducts its trading activities.  

The Company is exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of its market-making activities and other trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments (e.g., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads). The activities from which those exposures arise and the markets in which the Company is active include, but are not limited to, the following: emerging market corporate and government debt, non-investment grade and distressed corporate debt, investment grade corporate debt and asset-backed debt (including mortgage-related securities).  

The Company is exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining other positions (including positions in non-public entities). Positions in  

    91      

Table of Contents 

 non-public entities may include, but are not limited to, exposures to private equity, venture capital, private partnerships, real estate funds and other funds. Such positions are less liquid, have longer investment horizons and are more difficult to hedge than listed equities.  

The Company is exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency derivatives, from maintaining foreign exchange positions and from holding non-U.S. dollar-denominated financial instruments. The Company is exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market-making activities and maintaining positions in physical commodities (such as crude and refined oil products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals) and related derivatives. Commodity exposures are subject to periods of high price volatility as a result of changes in supply and demand. These changes can be caused by weather conditions; physical production, transportation and storage issues; or geopolitical and other events that affect the available supply and level of demand for these commodities.  

The Company manages its trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products (e.g., futures, forwards, swaps and options). Hedging activities may not always provide effective mitigation against trading losses due to differences in the terms, specific characteristics or other basis risks that may exist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that is being hedged. The Company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a Company-wide basis, on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis. The Company manages and monitors its market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that the Company believes is well-diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects the Companys aggregate risk tolerance as established by the Companys senior management.  

Aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Company and for its major trading divisions worldwide (equity and fixed income, which includes interest rate products, credit products, foreign exchange and commodities). Additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management.  

The Market Risk Department independently reviews the Companys trading portfolios on a regular basis from a market risk perspective utilizing VaR and other quantitative and qualitative risk measures and analyses. The Companys trading businesses and the Market Risk Department also use, as appropriate, measures such as sensitivity to changes in interest rates, prices, implied volatilities and time decay to monitor and report market risk exposures.  

Net exposure, defined as the potential loss to the Company over a period of time in the event of default of a referenced asset, assuming zero recovery, is one key risk measure the Company employs to standardize the aggregation of market risk exposures across cash and derivative products. Stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors for certain products, is performed periodically and is reviewed by trading division risk managers, desk risk managers and the Market Risk Department.  

VaR. The Company uses the statistical technique known as VaR as one of the tools used to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of its trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department calculates and distributes daily VaR-based risk measures to various levels of management.  

VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations. The Company estimates VaR using a model based on historical simulation for major market risk factors and Monte Carlo simulation for name-specific risk in certain equity and fixed income exposures. Historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on two sets of inputs: historical observation of daily  

      92    

Table of Contents 

 changes in key market indices or other market factors (market risk factors); and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes. The Companys VaR model uses four years of historical data to characterize potential changes in market risk factors. The Companys 95%/one-day VaR corresponds to the unrealized loss in portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or five times in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day.  

The Companys VaR model generally takes into account linear and non-linear exposures to price risk, interest rate risk and credit spread risk and linear exposures to implied volatility risks. Market risks that are incorporated in the VaR model include equity and commodity prices, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates and associated implied volatilities. The VaR model also captures certain correlation risks associated with portfolio credit derivatives, as well as certain basis risks between corporate debt and related credit derivatives. As a supplement to the use of historical simulation for major market risk factors, the Companys VaR model uses Monte Carlo simulation to capture name-specific risk in equities and credit products (i.e., corporate bonds, loans and credit derivatives).  

The Companys VaR models evolve over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. The Company is committed to continuous review and enhancement of VaR methodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving risks associated with changes in market structure and dynamics. As part of regular process improvement, additional systematic and name-specific risk factors may be added to improve the VaR models ability to more accurately estimate risks to specific asset classes or industry sectors.  

Among their benefits, VaR models permit estimation of a portfolios aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks; reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities; and can cover a wide range of portfolio assets. However, VaR risk measures should be interpreted carefully in light of the methodologys limitations, which include the following: past changes in market risk factors may not always yield accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements; changes in portfolio value in response to market movements (especially for complex derivative portfolios) may differ from the responses calculated by a VaR model; VaR using a one-day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day; the historical market risk factor data used for VaR estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the VaR; and published VaR results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions. VaR is most appropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid financial markets and will understate the risk associated with severe events, such as periods of extreme illiquidity. The Company is aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, uses VaR as only one component in its risk management oversight process. As explained above, this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensive risk monitoring, analysis, and control at the trading desk, division and Company levels.  

VaR for 2009. The table below presents the Companys Trading, Non-trading and Aggregate VaR for each of the Companys primary market risk exposures as of December 31, 2009, December 31, 2008 and November 30, 2008, incorporating substantially all financial instruments generating market risk that are managed by the Companys trading businesses. This measure of VaR incorporates most of the Companys trading-related market risks. However, a small proportion of trading positions generating market risk is not included in VaR, and the modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies upon approximations that, under certain circumstances, could produce significantly different VaR results from those produced using more precise measures.  

Aggregate VaR also incorporates certain non-trading risks, including (a) the interest rate risk generated by funding liabilities related to institutional trading positions, (b) public company equity positions recorded as investments by the Company and (c) corporate loan exposures that are awaiting distribution to the market.  

    93      

Table of Contents 

 Investments made by the Company that are not publicly traded are not reflected in the VaR results presented below. Aggregate VaR also excludes the credit spread risk generated by the Companys funding liabilities and the interest rate risk associated with approximately $7.7 billion of certain funding liabilities primarily related to fixed and other non-trading assets as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. The credit spread risk sensitivity of the Companys mark-to-market funding liabilities corresponded to an increase in value of approximately $11 million for each +1 basis point (or 1/100th of a percentage point) widening in the Companys credit spread level as of both December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.  

Since the VaR statistics reported below are estimates based on historical position and market data, VaR should not be viewed as predictive of the Companys future revenues or financial performance or of its ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that the Companys actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days. VaR does not predict the magnitude of losses which, should they occur, may be significantly greater than the VaR amount.  

The table below presents the Companys 95%/one-day VaR:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Diversification benefit equals the difference between Total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the four primary market risk categories occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each category.  

The Companys Trading VaR at December 31, 2009 was $135 million compared with $117 million and $104 million at December 31, 2008 and November 30, 2008, respectively. Non-trading VaR at December 31, 2009 increased to $100 million from $68 million and $67 million at December 31, 2008 and November 30, 2008, respectively. Aggregate VaR at December 31, 2009 was $187 million compared with $144 million and $135 million at December 31, 2008 and November 30, 2008, respectively.  

Average Trading VaR for 2009 increased to $119 million from $113 million for the one month ended December 31, 2008 and $98 million for fiscal 2008. Average Non-trading VaR for 2009 increased to $102 million from $73 million for the one month ended December 31, 2008 and $53 million for fiscal 2008. Average Total VaR for 2009 increased to $165 million from $143 million for the one month ended December 31, 2008 and $115 million for fiscal 2008.  

The VaR increases for 2009 were primarily driven by increased exposure to interest rate and credit sensitive products across the trading and non-trading portfolios. The trading portfolio also experienced increases due to increased equity and foreign currency exposure. Additionally, the Companys VaR for 2009 was affected by higher market volatilities over the period, as explained below.

VaR Statistics under Varying Assumptions.  

VaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in the breadth of products included in each firms VaR model, in the statistical assumptions made when simulating changes in market factors, and in the methods used to approximate portfolio revaluations under the simulated market conditions. The extreme market volatilities in the latter part of 2008 had a significant impact on VaR in 2009. The impact varies depending on the factor history assumptions, the frequency with which the factor history is updated and the confidence level. As a result, VaR statistics are more reliable and relevant when used as indicators of trends in risk taking rather than as a basis for inferring differences in risk taking across firms.  

Table 2 presents the VaR statistics that would result if the Company were to adopt alternative parameters for its calculations, such as the reported confidence level (95% versus 99%) for the VaR statistic or a shorter historical time series (four-year versus one-year) for market data upon which it bases its simulations. Both the average four-year VaR and the average one-year VaR for 2009 are sensitive to the high market volatilities experienced in the fourth quarter of 2008. However, we expect the one-year VaR to decline relative to the four-year VaR in the coming months, as the highly volatile period in the fourth quarter of 2008 will remain in the four-year VaR, but will no longer be a factor in the one-year VaR.

 (1) Diversification benefit equals the difference between Total VaR and the sum of the VaRs for the four risk categories. This benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the four primary market risk categories occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each category.

Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues for 2009.  

As shown in Table 1, the Companys average 95%/one-day Trading VaR for 2009 was $119 million. The histogram below presents the distribution of the Companys daily 95%/one-day Trading VaR for 2009. The most frequently occurring value was between $112 million and $115 million, while for approximately 93% of trading days during the year VaR ranged between $103 million and $139 million.  

      96

As shown in Table 1, the Companys average 95%/one-day Trading VaR for the one month ended December 31, 2008 was $113 million. The histogram below presents the distribution of the Companys daily 95%/one-day Trading VaR for the one month ended December 31, 2008. The most frequently occurring value was between $115 million and $118 million, while for approximately 70% of trading days during the month VaR ranged between $109 million and $118 million.  

One method of evaluating the reasonableness of the Companys VaR model as a measure of the Companys potential volatility of net revenue is to compare the VaR with actual trading revenue. Assuming no intra-day trading, for a 95%/one-day VaR, the expected number of times that trading losses should exceed VaR during the year is 13, and, in general, if trading losses were to exceed VaR more than 21 times in a year, the accuracy of the VaR model could be questioned. Accordingly, the Company evaluates the reasonableness of its VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results. For days where losses exceed the 95% or 99% VaR statistic, the Company examines the drivers of trading losses to evaluate the VaR models accuracy relative to realized trading results.  

The Company incurred daily trading losses in excess of the 95%/one-day Trading VaR on one day during 2009 and three days during the month ended December 31, 2008. The Company bases its VaR calculations on the long term (or unconditional) distribution with four years of observations and therefore evaluates its risk from an historical perspective. The Company is evaluating enhancements to the VaR model to make it more responsive to more recent market conditions, while maintaining a longer-term perspective.

The histograms below show the distribution of daily net trading revenue during 2009 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, respectively, for the Companys trading businesses (including net interest and non-agency commissions but excluding certain non-trading revenues such as primary, fee-based and prime brokerage revenue credited to the trading businesses). During 2009 and the one month ended December 31, 2008, the Company experienced net trading losses on 38 days and 14 days, respectively. The loss days observed during December 2008 were driven predominately by increased levels of volatility realized in the market.

Credit Risk.  

Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations. The Company is exposed to two distinct types of credit risk in its businesses. The Company incurs single name credit risk exposure through the Institutional Securities business and to a lesser extent through its lending activities in its Global Wealth Management Group. This type of risk requires credit analysis of specific counterparties, both initially and on an ongoing basis. The Company also incurs individual consumer credit risk in the Global Wealth Management Group business segment lending to individual investors, including margin and non-purpose loans collateralized by securities and through single-family residential prime mortgage loans in jumbo or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) form.  

The Company has structured its credit risk management framework to reflect that each of its businesses generates unique credit risks, and Credit Risk Management establishes company-wide practices to evaluate, monitor and control credit risk exposure both within and across business segments. The Credit Limits Framework is one of the primary tools used to evaluate and manage credit risk levels across the Company and is calibrated within the Companys risk tolerance. The Credit Limits Framework includes single name limits and portfolio concentration limits by country, industry and product type. Credit Risk Management is responsible for ensuring transparency of material credit risks, ensuring compliance with established limits, approving material extensions of credit, and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. Credit risk exposure is managed by Credit Risk Management and through various risk committees, whose membership includes Credit Risk Management. Accordingly, Credit Risk Management also works closely with the Market Risk Department to monitor risk exposures, including margin loans, mortgage loans and credit sensitive, higher risk transactions.

Institutional Securities Activities.  

Corporate Lending. In connection with certain of its Institutional Securities business activities, the Company provides loans or lending commitments (including bridge financing) to selected clients. Such loans and lending commitments can generally be classified as either relationship-driven or event-driven.  

Relationship-driven loans and lending commitments are generally made to expand business relationships with select clients. The commitments associated with relationship-driven activities may not be indicative of the Companys actual funding requirements, as the commitment may expire unused or the borrower may not fully utilize the commitment. The borrowers of relationship-driven lending transactions may be investment grade or non-investment grade. The Company may hedge its exposures in connection with relationship-driven transactions.  

Event-driven loans and lending commitments refer to activities associated with a particular event or transaction, such as to support client merger, acquisition or recapitalization transactions. The commitments associated with these event-driven activities may not be indicative of the Companys actual funding requirements since funding is contingent upon a proposed transaction being completed. In addition, the borrower may not fully utilize the commitment or the Companys portion of the commitment may be reduced through the syndication process. The borrowers ability to draw on the commitment is also subject to certain terms and conditions, among other factors. The borrowers of event-driven lending transactions may be investment grade or non-investment grade. The Company risk manages its exposures in connection with event-driven transactions through various means, including syndication, distribution and/or hedging.  

Securitized Products. While new activity has been reduced from historical levels, the Company may extend short or long-term funding to clients through loans and lending commitments that are secured by assets of the borrower and generally provide for over-collateralization, including commercial real estate, loans secured by loan pools, corporate and operating company loans, and secured lines of revolving credit. Credit risk with respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the loan agreement or a decline in actual or underlying collateral value.  

Derivative Contracts. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into a variety of derivative contracts related to financial instruments and commodities. The Company uses these instruments for trading and hedging purposes, as well as for asset and liability management. These instruments generally represent future commitments to swap interest payment streams, exchange currencies, or purchase or sell commodities and other financial instruments on specific terms at specified future dates. Many of these products have maturities that do not extend beyond one year, although swaps, options and equity warrants typically have longer maturities.  

The Company incurs credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. The Companys exposure to credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of the derivative contracts reported as assets. The fair value of derivatives represents the amount at which the derivative could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants and is further described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. Future changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, or the fair values of the financial instruments, commodities or indices underlying these contracts ultimately may result in cash settlements exceeding fair value amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition.  

Other. In addition to the activities noted above, there are other credit risks managed by Credit Risk Management and various business areas within Institutional Securities. The Company incurs credit risk through margin and collateral transactions with clearing houses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms and other financial counterparties. Certain risk management activities as they pertain to establishing appropriate collateral amounts for the Companys prime brokerage and securitized product businesses are primarily monitored within those respective areas in that they determine the appropriate collateral level for each strategy or position. In addition, a collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function. In addition, certain businesses with heightened settlement risk monitor compliance with established settlement risk limits.

Analyzing Credit Risk. Credit risk management takes place at the transaction, counterparty and portfolio levels. In order to protect the Company from losses resulting from these activities, Credit Risk Management analyzes all material lending and derivative transactions and ensures that the creditworthiness of the Companys counterparties and borrowers is reviewed regularly and that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. Credit Risk Management assigns obligor credit ratings to the Companys counterparties and borrowers. These credit ratings are intended to assess a counterpartys probability of default and are derived using methodologies generally consistent with those employed by external rating agencies. Credit ratings of BB+ or below are considered non-investment grade. Additionally, Credit Risk Management evaluates the relative position of the Companys particular obligation in the borrowers capital structure and relative recovery prospects, as well as collateral (if applicable) and other structural elements of the particular transaction.  

Risk Mitigation. The Company may seek to mitigate credit risk from its lending and derivatives transactions in multiple ways. At the transaction level, the Company seeks to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor, seniority and collateral. The Company actively hedges its lending and derivatives exposure through various financial instruments that may include single name, portfolio and structured credit derivatives. Additionally, the Company may sell, assign or sub-participate funded loans and lending commitments to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan market. In connection with its derivatives trading activities, the Company generally enters into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide the Company with the ability to offset a counterpartys rights and obligations, request additional collateral when necessary or liquidate the collateral in the event of counterparty default.  

Credit ExposureCorporate Lending. The following tables present information about the Companys corporate funded loans and lending commitments as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. The total corporate lending exposure column includes both lending commitments and funded loans. Fair value of corporate lending exposure represents the fair value of loans that have been drawn by the borrower and lending commitments that were outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. Lending commitments represent legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 for both relationship-driven and event-driven lending transactions. As discussed above, these loans and lending commitments have varying terms, may be senior or subordinated, may be secured or unsecured, are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower, and may be syndicated, traded or hedged by the Company.  

As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the aggregate amount of investment grade loans was $6.5 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively, and the aggregate amount of non-investment grade loans was $9.5 billion and $9.4 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the aggregate amount of lending commitments outstanding was $47.9 billion and $43.9 billion, respectively. In connection with these corporate lending activities (which include corporate funded loans and lending commitments), the Company had hedges (which include single name, sector and index hedges) with a notional amount of $25.8 billion and $35.7 billion related to the total corporate lending exposure of $64.0 billion and $60.7 billion as of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Each category of derivative products in the above tables includes a variety of instruments, which can differ substantially in their characteristics. Instruments in each category can be denominated in U.S. dollars or in one or more non-U.S. currencies.  

The Company determines the fair values recorded in the above tables using various pricing models. For a discussion of fair value as it affects the consolidated financial statements, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 7, herein and Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements.  

Credit Derivatives. A credit derivative is a contract between a seller (guarantor) and buyer (beneficiary) of protection against the risk of a credit event occurring on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity. The beneficiary pays a periodic premium (typically quarterly) over the life of the contract and is protected for the period. If a credit event occurs, the guarantor is required to make payment to the beneficiary based on the terms of the credit derivative contract. Credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay, obligation acceleration, repudiation and payment moratorium. Debt restructurings are also considered a credit event in some cases. In certain transactions referenced to a portfolio of referenced entities or asset-backed securities, deductibles and caps may limit the guarantors obligations.  

      106

The Company trades in a variety of derivatives and may either purchase or write protection on a single name or portfolio of referenced entities. The Company is an active market-maker in the credit derivatives markets. As a market-maker, the Company works to earn a bid-offer spread on client flow business and manage any residual credit or correlation risk on a portfolio basis. The Company also trades and takes credit risk in credit default swap form on a proprietary basis. Further, the Company uses credit derivatives to manage its exposure to residential and commercial mortgage loans and corporate lending exposures during the periods presented.  

The Company actively monitors its counterparty credit risk related to credit derivatives. A majority of the Companys counterparties are banks, broker-dealers, insurance, and other financial institutions and Monolines. Contracts with these counterparties do not include ratings-based termination events but do include counterparty rating downgrades, which may result in additional collateral being required by the Company. For further information on the Companys exposure to Monolines, see Certain Factors Affecting Results of OperationsMonoline Insurers herein. The master agreements with these Monoline counterparties are generally unsecured, and the few ratings-based triggers (if any) generally provide the Company the ability to terminate only upon significant downgrade. As with all derivative contracts, the Company considers counterparty credit risk in the valuation of its positions and recognizes credit valuation adjustments as appropriate.  

The following table summarizes the key characteristics of the Companys credit derivative portfolio by counterparty as of December 31, 2009. The fair values shown are before the application of any counterparty or cash collateral netting:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Amounts shown are presented before the application of any counterparty or cash collateral netting. The Companys credit default swaps are classified in both Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Approximately 16% of receivable fair values and 11% of payable fair values represent Level 3 amounts.  

 (2) As part of an industry-wide effort to reduce the total notional amount of outstanding offsetting credit derivative trades, the Company participated in novating credit default swap contracts with external counterparties to a central clearinghouse during 2009.  

Country Exposure. As of December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, primarily based on the domicile of the counterparty, approximately 5% and 8%, respectively, of the Companys credit exposure (for credit exposure arising from corporate loans and lending commitments as discussed above and current exposure arising from the Companys OTC derivative contracts) was to emerging markets, and no one emerging market country accounted for more than 1% and 2%, respectively, of the Companys credit exposure.  

The Company defines emerging markets to include generally all countries where the economic, legal and political systems are transitional and in the process of developing into more transparent and accountable systems that are consistent with advanced countries.

Global Wealth Management Group Activities.  

Margin Lending. Customer margin accounts, the primary source of retail credit exposure, are collateralized in accordance with internal and regulatory guidelines. The Company monitors required margin levels and established credit limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions, when necessary. Factors considered in the review of margin loans are the amount of the loan, the intended purpose, the degree of leverage being employed in the account, and overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies to reduce risk. Additionally, transactions relating to concentrated or restricted positions require a review of any legal impediments to liquidation of the underlying collateral. Underlying collateral for margin loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations. At December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, there were approximately $5.3 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, of customer margin loans outstanding.  

The Company, through agreements with Citi relating to the formation of MSSB, retains certain credit risk for margin and non-purpose loans that are held at Citigroup Global Markets Inc. in its capacity as clearing broker for certain MSSB clients. The related loans are generally subject to the same oversight as similar margin and non-purpose loans held by the Company and its subsidiaries.  

Non-purpose Securities-Based Lending. Non-purpose securities-based lending allows clients to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities for any suitable purpose other than purchasing, trading, or carrying marketable securities or refinancing margin debt. The Company establishes approved lines and advance rates against qualifying securities and monitors limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, requires customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce debt positions, when necessary. Factors considered in the review of non-purpose securities-based lending are amount of the loan, the degree of concentrated or restricted positions, and the overall evaluation of the portfolio to ensure proper diversification or, in the case of concentrated positions, appropriate liquidity of the underlying collateral or potential hedging strategies. Underlying collateral for non-purpose securities-based loans is reviewed with respect to the liquidity of the proposed collateral positions, valuation of securities, historic trading range, volatility analysis and an evaluation of industry concentrations.  

Commercial Lending. The Global Wealth Management Group provides structured credit facilities to high net worth individuals and their small and medium-size domestic businesses, with a suite of products that includes working capital lines of credit, revolving lines of credit, standby letters of credit, term loans and commercial real estate mortgages. Clients are required to submit a credit application and financial statements to a centralized credit processing platform, and underwriting professionals recommend a lending structure following an analysis of the borrower, the guarantor, the collateral, cash flow, liquidity, leverage and credit history. For standard transactions, credit requests are approved via signature of independent credit professionals, and where transactions are of size and higher complexity, approval is secured through a formal loan committee chaired by independent credit professionals. The facility is risk rated and upon credit approval and loan closing is closely monitored through active account management and covenant compliance certificates.

Consumer Lending Activities.  

With respect to first mortgages and second mortgages, including HELOC (mortgage lending), a loan evaluation process is adopted within a framework of credit underwriting policies and collateral valuation. The Companys underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of capacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis of applicable industry standard credit scoring models (e.g., FICO scores), debt ratios and reserves of the borrower. Loan-to-collateral value ratios are determined based on independent third-party property appraisal/valuations, and security lien position is established through title/ownership reports. Historically all mortgages were originated to be sold or securitized. Eligible conforming loans are currently sold to the government-sponsored enterprises while most jumbo and HELOC loans will be held for investment in the Companys portfolio.  

Operational Risk.  

Operational risk refers to the risk of financial or other loss, or potential damage to a firms reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events (e.g., external or internal fraud, legal and compliance risks, damage to physical assets). The Company may incur operational risk across the full scope of its business activities, including revenue generating activities (e.g., sales and trading) and support functions (e.g., information technology and facilities management). Legal and compliance risk is included in the scope of operational risk and is discussed below under Legal Risk.  

The goal of the Companys operational risk management framework is to establish company-wide operational risk standards related to risk measurement, monitoring and management. Operational risk policies establish a framework to reduce the likelihood and/or impact of operational incidents as well as to mitigate legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The framework continually responds to changing regulatory and business environment landscape. As a foundation for the Basel II Advanced Measurement Approach, an enhanced risk-based capital model has been developed for the calculation of capital related to operational risk. This model encompasses both quantitative and qualitative elements, including internal and external operational incidents, metrics, risk and control self-assessments, and scenario analysis.  

The Operational Risk Oversight Committee, a company-wide committee, is chaired by the Companys Chief Risk Officer and assists the FRC in executing its responsibilities for oversight of operational risk, including evaluating assessments of risk exposure, reviewing the Companys significant operational risk exposures, recommending and overseeing company-wide remediation efforts, review and evaluation of current event risk issues, and establishing company-wide operational risk program standards related to risk measurement, monitoring and management.  

The Companys Operational Risk Manager oversees, monitors, measures, analyzes and reports on operational risk across the Company. The Operational Risk Manager is independent of the business segments and is supported by the company-wide Operational Risk Department. The Operational Risk Manager is also responsible for facilitating, designing, implementing and monitoring the company-wide operational risk program. The Operational Risk Department works with the business segments and control groups to help ensure a transparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk within each area and across the Company globally.  

Primary responsibility for the management of operational risk is with the business segments, the control groups and the business managers therein. The business managers, generally, maintain processes and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report operational risk. As new products and business activities are developed and processes are designed and modified, operational risks are considered. Each business segment has a designated operational risk coordinator. The operational risk coordinator regularly reviews operational risk issues and reports with senior management within each business. Each control group also has a designated operational risk coordinator, or equivalent, and a forum for discussing operational risk matters and/or reports with senior management. Oversight of operational risk is provided by business segment and regional risk committees and the Operational Risk Oversight Committee.

Business Continuity Management is an ongoing program of analysis and planning that helps ensure a recovery strategy and required resources for the resumption of critical business functions following a disaster or other business interruption. Disaster recovery plans are in place for critical facilities and resources on a company-wide basis, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. The key components of the Companys disaster recovery plans include: crisis management; business recovery plans; applications/data recovery; work area recovery; and other elements addressing management, analysis, training and testing.  

The Company maintains an information security program that coordinates the management of information security risks and satisfies regulatory requirements. Information security procedures are designed to protect the Companys information assets against unauthorized disclosure, modification or misuse. These procedures cover a broad range of areas, including: application entitlements, data protection, incident response, Internet and electronic communications, remote access and portable devices. The Company has also established policies, procedures and technologies to protect its computers and other assets from unauthorized access.  

The Company utilizes the services of external vendors in connection with the Companys ongoing operations. These may include, for example, outsourced processing and support functions and consulting and other professional services. The Company manages its exposures to the quality of these services through a variety of means, including service level and other contractual agreements, service and quality reviews, and ongoing monitoring of the vendors performance. It is anticipated that the use of these services will continue and possibly increase in the future.  

Legal Risk.  

Legal risk includes the risk of non-compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and standards. Legal risk also includes contractual and commercial risk such as the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable. The Company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its business (see BusinessSupervision and Regulation in Part I, Item 1). The Company has established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to foster compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The Company, principally through the Legal and Compliance Division, also has established procedures that are designed to require that the Companys policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed globally. In connection with its businesses, the Company has and continuously develops various procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements, sales and trading practices, new products, potential conflicts of interest, structured transactions, use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities, credit granting, money laundering, privacy and recordkeeping. In addition, the Company has established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authority and capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. The legal and regulatory focus on the financial services industry presents a continuing business challenge for the Company.
