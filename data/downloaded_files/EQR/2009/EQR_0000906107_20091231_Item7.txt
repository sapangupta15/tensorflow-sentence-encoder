Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company should be read in connection with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. Due to the Companys ability to control the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries other than entities owning interests in the Partially Owned Properties  Unconsolidated and certain other entities in which the Company has investments, the Operating Partnership and each such subsidiary entity has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined are as defined elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.  

Forward-Looking Statements  

Forward-looking statements in this Item 7 as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are intended to be made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, projections and assumptions made by management. While the Companys management believes the assumptions underlying its forward-looking statements are reasonable, such information is inherently subject to uncertainties and may involve certain risks, which could cause actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Many of these uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and beyond managements control. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, results or events. The forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date hereof and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or supplement these forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to the following:  

       We intend to actively acquire multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate. The Company also develops projects and currently has several properties under development. We may begin new development activities if conditions warrant. We may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to complete a development property. Additionally, we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts. This competition may increase prices for multifamily properties. We may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms. To the extent that we do develop more properties if conditions warrant, we expect to do so ourselves in addition to co-investing with our development partners. The total number of development units, costs of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions (such as the cost of labor and construction materials), competition and local government regulation;  

       Debt financing and other capital required by the Company may not be available or may only be available on adverse terms;  

       Labor and materials required for maintenance, repair, capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated;  

30

       Occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including, without limitation, new construction and excess inventory of multifamily housing and single family housing, slow or negative employment growth, availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability, all of which are beyond the Companys control; and  

       Additional factors as discussed in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly those under Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Forward-looking statements and related uncertainties are also included in Notes 2, 5, 11 and 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report.  

Overview  

Equity Residential (EQR), a Maryland real estate investment trust (REIT) formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT.  

The Company is one of the largest publicly traded real estate companies and is the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily properties in the United States (based on the aggregate market value of its outstanding Common Shares, the number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned). The Companys corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also operates property management offices throughout the United States. As of December 31, 2009, the Company has approximately 4,100 employees who provide real estate operations, leasing, legal, financial, accounting, acquisition, disposition, development and other support functions.  

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2009 owned an approximate 95.2% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the Operating Partnership). The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (UPREIT) under which all property ownership and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. References to the Company include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.  

Business Objectives and Operating Strategies  

The Company seeks to maximize current income, capital appreciation of each property and the total return for its shareholders. The Companys strategy for accomplishing these objectives includes:  

       Leveraging our size and scale in four critical ways:  

       Investing in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets to maximize our total return on an enterprise level;  

       Meeting the needs of our residents by offering a wide array of product choices and a commitment to service;  

       Engaging, retaining and attracting the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed; and  

       Sharing resources and best practices in both property management and across the enterprise.  

       Owning a highly diversified portfolio in our target markets. Target markets are defined by a combination of the following criteria:  

       High barrier-to-entry markets where because of land scarcity or government regulation it is difficult or costly to build new apartment complexes leading to low supply;  

       Strong economic growth leading to high demand for apartments; and  

       Markets with an attractive quality of life leading to high demand and retention.  

       Giving residents reasons to stay with the Company by providing a range of product choices available in our diversified portfolio and by enhancing their experience with us through meticulous customer service by our employees and by providing various value-added services.  

       Being open and responsive to changes in the market in order to take advantage of investment opportunities that align with our long-term vision.

Acquisition, Development and Disposition Strategies  

The Company anticipates that future property acquisitions, developments and dispositions will occur within the United States. Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt securities, sales of properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (OP Units) as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market opportunities.  

When evaluating potential acquisitions, developments and dispositions, the Company generally considers the following factors:  

       strategically targeted markets;  

       income levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market;  

       employment and household growth and net migration in the relevant markets population;  

       barriers to entry that would limit competition (zoning laws, building permit availability, supply of undeveloped or developable real estate, local building costs and construction costs, among other factors);  

       the location, construction quality, age, condition and design of the property;  

       the current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow;  

       the potential for capital appreciation of the property;  

       the terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases;  

       the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located;  

       the occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity (the overall market and submarket);  

       the prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property;  

       the benefits of integration into existing operations;  

       purchase prices and yields of available existing stabilized properties, if any;  

       competition from existing multifamily properties, comparably priced single family homes or rentals, residential properties under development and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area; and  

       opportunistic selling based on demand and price of high quality assets, including condominium conversions.  

The Company generally reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve its acquisition, development and rehab strategies and at times to fund its debt maturities and debt and equity repurchase activities. In addition, when feasible, the Company may structure these transactions as tax-deferred exchanges.  

Current Environment  

The slowdown in the economy, which accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2008 and continued into 2009, coupled with continued job losses and/or lack of job growth leads us to be cautious regarding expected performance for 2010. Since the fourth quarter of 2008 and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2009, our revenue has declined in comparison to the prior year in most of our major markets as the economic slowdown continues to impact existing and prospective residents. Markets with little employment loss have performed better than markets with larger employment issues. Although all of our markets experienced job losses in 2009, the pace of those losses appears to have begun to slow. While the job market is likely to remain weak in 2010, beginning late in the fourth quarter of 2009, household spending was reported to have increased and the deterioration in the labor market showed signs of abating. Despite a generally improving credit environment and better general economic conditions, the Company may continue to experience a period of declining revenues, which would adversely impact the Companys results of operations. The vast majority of our leases are for terms of 12 months or less. As a result, we quickly feel the impact of an economic downturn which limits our ability to raise rents or causes us to lower rents on turnover units and lease renewals. During late 2008 and early 2009, our rental rates declined on average between 9% and 10% for new residents but on average less than 1% for renewing residents. Rental rates have not declined, on average, since the first quarter of 2009 and began to show improvement in the latter part of the year. However, since our rental rates increased during most of 2008, our quarter over quarter revenue declines worsened each quarter in 2009 as compared to 2008. Quarter over quarter revenue declines are expected to continue in 2010 (although they should be less negative in 2010 vs. 2009 than when comparing 2009 vs. 2008). Given the roll-down in lease rates that occurred throughout 2009, the full year comparison to 2010 will continue to show declining revenue even if quarter over quarter revenue improvement begins  

32

 in the second half of 2010. Our revenues are also impacted by our resident turnover rates, which have generally declined, and our occupancy rates, which began to rise in the fourth quarter of 2009. After three consecutive years of excellent expense control (same store expenses declined 0.1% between 2009 and 2008 and grew 2.2% between 2008 and 2007 and 2.1% between 2007 and 2006), the Company anticipates that 2010 same store expenses will increase between 1.0% and 2.0% primarily due to cost pressures from non-controllable areas such as real estate taxes and utilities. The combination of expected declines in revenues and moderately increasing expense levels will have a negative impact on the Companys results of operations for 2010.  

The strained credit environment has negatively impacted the availability and pricing of debt capital. However, during this time, the multifamily residential sector has benefited from the continued liquidity provided by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A vast majority of the properties we sold in 2008 and 2009 were financed for the purchaser by one of these agencies. Furthermore, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provided us with approximately $1.6 billion of secured mortgage financing in 2008 and $500.0 million in 2009 at attractive rates when compared to other sources of credit at that time. While unsecured credit markets improved in the latter part of 2009 and the Company currently has unsecured lending options available to it at attractive rates, should the agencies discontinue providing liquidity to our sector, have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded or reorganized by the government, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and/or increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets.  

In response to the recession and liquidity issues prevalent in the debt markets, we took a number of steps to better position ourselves. In early 2008, we began pre-funding our maturing debt obligations with approximately $1.6 billion in secured mortgage financing obtained from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We also significantly reduced our acquisition activity. During the second half of 2008 and through the fourth quarter of 2009, we only acquired four properties (one of which was the buyout of our partner in an unconsolidated asset) and a long-term leasehold interest in a land parcel while we continued selling non-core assets. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company sold 60 properties consisting of 12,489 units for $1.0 billion, as well as 62 condominium units for $12.0 million. The Company acquired two properties consisting of 566 units for $145.0 million, one previously unconsolidated property consisting of 250 units for $18.5 million from its institutional joint venture partner and a long-term leasehold interest in a land parcel for $11.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2009. While we believe these sales of non-core assets better positions us for future success, they have resulted and will continue to result in dilution, particularly when the net sales proceeds are initially not reinvested in activities generating equivalent income such as acquisition of rental properties or repayment of debt. Additionally, we have significantly reduced our development activities, starting only two new projects in the first half of 2008 and none in the second half of the year or during 2009. We also reduced the number of planned development projects we will undertake in the future and took a $116.4 million impairment charge in 2008 to reduce the value of five assets that we no longer plan on pursuing. We took an additional $11.1 million impairment charge in 2009 to reduce the value of one asset. The Company reduced its quarterly common share dividend beginning with the dividend for the third quarter of 2009, from $0.4825 per share (an annual rate of $1.93 per share) to $0.3375 per share (an annual rate of $1.35 per share).  

The credit environment improved throughout mid and late 2009 and we currently have access to multiple sources of capital allowing us a less cautious posture with respect to pre-funding our maturing debt obligations. As a result of the improved credit environment, in late 2009, we utilized $366.2 million of cash on hand to repurchase certain unsecured notes and convertible notes in public tender offers. Concurrently, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, we began to see an increase in the availability of attractive acquisition opportunities. We expect to revert from a net seller of assets during 2009 to a net buyer of assets in 2010. During 2010, we expect that property dispositions will be more a funding source for attractive acquisition opportunities that we may identify than for providing needed capital to protect the Companys financial position. Our access to capital and our ability to execute large, complex transactions should be competitive advantages in 2010. However, should a double-dip recession materialize or credit/equity markets deteriorate, we may seek to take steps similar to what we did in 2008 and early 2009 to increase liquidity and better position ourselves.  

Our specific current expectations regarding our results for 2010 and certain items that will affect them are set forth under Results of Operations below.  

We believe that cash and cash equivalents, securities readily convertible to cash, current availability on our revolving credit facility and disposition proceeds for 2010 will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to asset acquisitions, debt retirement and existing development projects through 2010. We expect that our remaining longer-term funding requirements will be met through some combination of new borrowings, equity issuances (including the Companys ATM share offering program), property dispositions and cash generated from operations.

Despite the challenging conditions noted above, we believe that the Company is well-positioned notwithstanding the slow economic recovery. Our properties are geographically diverse and were approximately 94% occupied as of December 31, 2009, little new multifamily rental supply has been added to most of our markets and the long-term demographic picture is positive.  

We believe we are well-positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover debt maturities and development fundings in the near term, which should allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities in the future. When economic conditions improve, the short-term nature of our leases and the limited supply of new rental housing being constructed should allow us to quickly realize revenue growth and improvement in our operating results.  

Results of Operations  

In conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy, the Company continued to invest or recycle its capital investment in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008. In summary, we:  

Year Ended December 31, 2009:  

       Acquired $145.0 million of apartment properties consisting of two properties and 566 units (excluding the Companys buyout of its partners interest in one previously unconsolidated property) and a long-term leasehold interest in a land parcel for $11.5 million, all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets; and  

       Sold $1.0 billion of apartment properties consisting of 60 properties and 12,489 units (excluding the Companys buyout of its partners interest in one previously unconsolidated property), as well as 62 condominium units for $12.0 million, the majority of which was in exit or less desirable markets.  

Year Ended December 31, 2008:  

       Acquired $380.7 million of apartment properties consisting of 7 properties and 2,141 units and an uncompleted development property for $31.7 million and invested $2.4 million to obtain the management contract rights and towards the redevelopment of a military housing project consisting of 978 units, all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets; and  

       Sold $896.7 million of apartment properties consisting of 41 properties and 10,127 units, as well as 130 condominium units for $26.1 million and a land parcel for $3.3 million, the majority of which was in exit or less desirable markets.  

The Companys primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income (NOI). NOI represents rental income less property and maintenance expense, real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense. The Company believes that NOI is helpful to investors as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of a real estate company because it is a direct measure of the actual operating results of the Companys apartment communities.  

Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2009 and 2008 (the 2009 Same Store Properties), which represented 113,598 units, impacted the Companys results of operations. Properties that the Company owned for all of both 2008 and 2007 (the 2008 Same Store Properties), which represented 115,051 units, also impacted the Companys results of operations. Both the 2009 Same Store Properties and 2008 Same Store Properties are discussed in the following paragraphs.  

The Companys acquisition, disposition and completed development activities also impacted overall results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. Dilution, as a result of the Companys net asset sales, negatively impacts property net operating income. The impacts of these activities are discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.  

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2009 to the year ended December 31, 2008  

For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $1.27 compared to $1.46 per share for the year ended December 31, 2008. The difference is primarily due to the following:  

34  

Table of Contents 

       $57.6 million in lower net gains on sales of discontinued operations in 2009 vs. 2008;  

       $84.0 million in lower property NOI in 2009 vs. 2008, primarily driven by $51.6 million in lower same store NOI and dilution from transaction activities, partially offset by higher NOI contributions from lease-up properties; and  

       Partially offset by $105.3 million in lower impairment losses in 2009 vs. 2008.  

For the year ended December 31, 2009, income from continuing operations increased approximately $40.9 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in continuing operations is discussed below.  

Revenues from the 2009 Same Store Properties decreased $52.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in average rental rates charged to residents and a decrease in occupancy. Expenses from the 2009 Same Store Properties decreased $0.8 million primarily due to lower property management costs, partially offset by higher real estate taxes and utility costs. The following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2009 Same Store Properties:

The following table presents a reconciliation of operating income per the consolidated statements of operations to NOI for the 2009 Same Store Properties.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For properties that the Company acquired prior to January 1, 2009 and expects to continue to own through December 31, 2010, the Company anticipates the following same store results for the full year ending December 31, 2010:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

These 2010 assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.  

Non-same store operating results increased approximately $34.3 million or 79.4% and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2008 and 2009, as well as operations from the Companys completed development properties and corporate housing business. While the operations of the non-same store assets have been negatively impacted during the year ended December 31, 2009 similar to the same store assets, the non-same store assets have contributed a greater percentage of total NOI to the Companys overall operating results primarily due to increasing occupancy for properties in lease-up and a longer ownership period in 2009 than 2008. This increase primarily resulted from:  

       Development and other miscellaneous properties in lease-up of $22.4 million;  

       Newly stabilized development and other miscellaneous properties of $1.6 million;  

       Properties acquired in 2008 and 2009 of $11.9 million; and  

       Partially offset by operating activities from other miscellaneous operations.  

See also Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys segment disclosures.  

Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased approximately $0.1 million or 3.4% primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on management of the Companys military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord Air Force Base, as well as a decrease in asset management expenses. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company managed 12,681 units and 14,485 units, respectively, primarily for unconsolidated entities and its military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord.  

Property management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Companys properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses decreased approximately $5.1 million or 6.7%. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower overall payroll-related costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the Companys portfolio, as well as  

36  

Table of Contents 

 decreases in temporary help/contractors, telecommunications and travel expenses.  

Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately $22.8 million or 4.1% primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2008 and 2009, development properties placed in service and capital expenditures for all properties owned.  

General and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $6.0 million or 13.3% primarily due to lower overall payroll-related costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the Companys portfolio, as well as a $2.9 million decrease in severance related costs in 2009 and a decrease in tax consulting costs. The Company anticipates that general and administrative expenses will approximate $38.0 million to $40.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.  

Impairment from continuing operations decreased approximately $105.3 million due to an $11.1 million impairment charge taken during 2009 on a land parcel held for development compared to a $116.4 million impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 on land held for development related to five potential development projects that are no longer being pursued. See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  

Interest and other income from continuing operations decreased approximately $16.8 million or 50.2% primarily as a result of an $18.7 million gain recognized during 2008 related to the partial debt extinguishment of the Companys notes compared to a $4.5 million gain recognized in 2009 (see Note 9). In addition, interest earned on cash and cash equivalents decreased due to a decrease in interest rates and because the Company received less insurance/litigation settlement proceeds and forfeited deposits in 2009, partially offset by a $4.9 million gain on the sale of investment securities realized in 2009. The Company anticipates that interest and other income will approximate $1.0 million to $3.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.  

Other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately $0.7 million or 12.6% primarily due to an increase in transaction costs incurred in conjunction with the Companys acquisition of two properties consisting of 566 units from unaffiliated parties, as well as expensing transaction costs associated with the Companys acquisition of all of its partners interests in five previously partially owned properties consisting of 1,587 units in 2009. This was partially offset by a decrease in pursuit cost write-offs as a result of the Companys decision to significantly reduce its development activities in 2009. The Company anticipates that other expenses will approximate $9.0 million to $12.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.  

Interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, increased approximately $17.4 million or 3.5% primarily as a result of an increase in debt extinguishment costs and lower capitalized interest. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $34.9 million as compared to $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. This capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 5.62% as compared to 5.56% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The Company anticipates that interest expense will approximate $466.0 million to $476.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.  

Income and other tax expense from continuing operations decreased approximately $2.5 million or 46.9% primarily due to a change in the estimate for Texas state taxes and lower overall state income taxes, partially offset by an increase in business taxes for Washington, D.C. The Company anticipates that income and other tax expense will approximate $1.0 million to $2.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.  

Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $2.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008 primarily due to the Companys $1.8 million share of defeasance costs incurred in conjunction with the extinguishment of cross-collateralized mortgage debt on one of the Companys partially owned unconsolidated joint ventures as well as a decline in the operating performance of these properties.  

Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased approximately $7.8 million as the Company sold seven unconsolidated properties in 2009 (inclusive of the one property where the Company acquired its partners interest) compared to three unconsolidated properties in 2008.  

37  

Table of Contents 

Net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately $3.0 million due to the sale of vacant land located in Florida during the year ended December 31, 2008 versus no land sales in 2009.  

Discontinued operations, net decreased approximately $95.2 million or 21.2% between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily due to lower gains from property sales during the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 and the operations of those properties. In addition, properties sold in 2009 reflect operations for a partial period in 2009 in contrast to a full period in 2008. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  

Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2008 to the year ended December 31, 2007  

For the year ended December 31, 2008, loss from continuing operations increased approximately $33.9 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease in continuing operations is discussed below.  

Revenues from the 2008 Same Store Properties increased $53.8 million primarily as a result of higher rental rates charged to residents. Expenses from the 2008 Same Store Properties increased $13.5 million primarily due to higher real estate taxes, utility costs and payroll. The following tables provide comparative same store results and statistics for the 2008 Same Store Properties:  

2008 vs. 2007

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Average rental rate is defined as total rental revenues divided by the weighted average occupied units for the period.  

Non-same store operating results increased approximately $66.1 million or 79.8% and consist primarily of properties acquired in calendar years 2008 and 2007, as well as operations from completed development properties and our corporate housing business.  

See also Note 20 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys segment disclosures.  

Fee and asset management revenues, net of fee and asset management expenses, increased approximately $2.0 million primarily due to an increase in revenue earned on management of the Companys military housing venture at Fort Lewis along with the addition of McChord Air Force Base, as well as a decrease in asset management expenses. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company managed 14,485 units and 14,472 units, respectively, primarily for unconsolidated entities and its military housing ventures at Fort Lewis and McChord.  

Property management expenses from continuing operations include off-site expenses associated with the self-management of the Companys properties as well as management fees paid to any third party management companies. These expenses decreased approximately $10.4 million or 11.9%. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower overall payroll-related costs as a result of a decrease in the number of properties in the Companys portfolio, as well as a decrease in legal and professional fees.  

Depreciation expense from continuing operations, which includes depreciation on non-real estate assets, increased approximately $28.3 million or 5.3% primarily as a result of additional depreciation expense on properties acquired in 2007 and 2008 and capital expenditures for all properties owned.  

General and administrative expenses from continuing operations, which include corporate operating expenses, decreased approximately $1.8 million or 3.9% primarily as a result of a $2.2 million decrease in profit sharing expense and lower overall payroll-related costs, partially offset by an increase in legal and professional fees due to a $1.7

 million expense recovery recorded for the year ended December 31, 2007 related to a certain lawsuit in Florida (see Note 21).  

Impairment from continuing operations increased approximately $116.4 million due to an impairment charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2008 on land held for development related to five potential development projects that will no longer be pursued. See Note 19 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  

Interest and other income from continuing operations increased approximately $13.5 million or 67.3% primarily as a result of an $18.7 million gain recognized during the year ended December 31, 2008 related to the partial debt extinguishment of the Companys June 2009 and August 2026 public notes (see Note 9), as well as an increase in short-term investments. This was partially offset by a $7.3 million decrease in interest earned on 1031 exchange and earnest money deposits due primarily to the decline in the Companys transaction activities.  

Other expenses from continuing operations increased approximately $3.9 million primarily due to an increase in the write-off of various pursuit and out-of-pocket costs for terminated development transactions and halted condominium conversion properties during 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007.  

Interest expense from continuing operations, including amortization of deferred financing costs, decreased approximately $0.2 million as a result of lower overall effective interest rates and a reduction in debt extinguishment costs, offset by higher overall debt levels outstanding due to the Companys 2007 share repurchase activity and its pre-funding of its 2008 and 2009 debt maturities. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company capitalized interest costs of approximately $60.1 million as compared to $45.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. This capitalization of interest primarily relates to consolidated projects under development. The effective interest cost on all indebtedness for the year ended December 31, 2008 was 5.56% as compared to 5.96% for the year ended December 31, 2007.  

Income and other tax expense from continuing operations increased approximately $2.8 million primarily due to a change in the estimate for Texas state taxes and an increase in franchise taxes.  

Loss from investments in unconsolidated entities increased approximately $0.4 million between the periods under comparison. This increase is primarily due to income received in 2007 from the sale of the Companys 7.075% ownership interest in Wellsford Park Highlands Corporation, an entity which owns a condominium development in Denver, Colorado.  

Net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities increased approximately $0.2 million primarily due to a $2.9 million gain on the sale of three unconsolidated institutional joint venture properties realized in 2008 compared to a gain of $2.6 million realized in 2007 on the sale of one property.  

Net gain on sales of land parcels decreased approximately $3.4 million primarily as a result of higher net gains realized in 2007 on the sale of two land parcels compared to the net gain realized in 2008 on the sale of one land parcel.  

Discontinued operations, net decreased approximately $577.1 million or 56.2% between the periods under comparison. This decrease is primarily due to a significant decrease in the number of properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the same period in 2007, as well as the mix of properties sold in each year. See Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

For the Year Ended December 31, 2009  

As of January 1, 2009, the Company had approximately $890.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $1.29 billion available under its revolving credit facility (net of $130.0 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and $75.0 million which had been committed by a now bankrupt financial institution and is not available for borrowing). After taking into effect the various transactions discussed in the following paragraphs and the net cash provided by operating activities, the Companys cash and cash equivalents balance at December 31, 2009 was approximately $193.3 million, its restricted 1031 exchange proceeds totaled $244.3 million and the amount available on the Companys revolving credit facility was $1.37 billion (net of $56.7 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of the $75.0 million discussed above). In 2008, the Company built a significant cash and cash equivalents balance as a direct result of its decision to pre-fund its 2008 and 2009 debt maturities with the closing of three secured mortgage loan pools totaling $1.6 billion. The decline in the Companys cash and cash  

39  

Table of Contents 

 equivalents balance since December 31, 2008 is a direct result of the application of the pre-funded cash on hand towards the Companys debt maturity, tender and repurchase activities, partially offset by the closing of a $500.0 million secured mortgage loan pool during 2009. See Notes 8 through 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company generated proceeds from various transactions, which included the following:  

       Disposed of 61 properties (including the Companys buyout of its partners interest in one unconsolidated property) and 62 condominium units, receiving net proceeds of $893.6 million;  

       Obtained $540.0 million in new mortgage financing and terminated six treasury locks, receiving $10.8 million;  

       Obtained an additional $198.8 million of new mortgage loans on development properties;  

       Received $215.8 million from maturing or sold investment securities; and  

       Issued approximately 4.2 million Common Shares and received net proceeds of $100.6 million.  

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the above proceeds were primarily utilized to:  

       Invest $330.6 million primarily in development projects;  

       Acquire three rental properties (including the Companys buyout of its partners interest in one unconsolidated property) and a long-term leasehold interest in a land parcel, utilizing cash of $175.5 million;  

       Repurchase 47,450 Common Shares, utilizing cash of $1.1 million (see Note 3);  

       Repurchase $652.1 million of fixed rate public notes;  

       Repay $122.2 million of fixed rate public notes at maturity;  

       Repurchase $75.8 million of fixed rate tax-exempt notes;  

       Repay $956.8 million of mortgage loans; and  

       Acquire $77.8 million of investment securities.  

In September 2009, the Company announced the creation of an At-The-Market (ATM) share offering program which would allow the Company to sell up to 17.0 million Common Shares from time to time over the next three years into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions. The Company may, but shall have no obligation to, sell Common Shares through the ATM share offering program in amounts and at times to be determined by the Company. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including (among others) market conditions, the trading price of the Companys Common Shares and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company issued approximately 3.5 million Common Shares at an average price of $35.38 per share for total consideration of approximately $123.7 million through the ATM share offering program. In addition, during the first quarter of 2010 through February 19, 2010, the Company has issued approximately 1.1 million Common Shares at an average price of $33.87 per share for total consideration of approximately $35.8 million. Cumulative to date, the Company has issued approximately 4.6 million Common Shares at an average price of $35.03 for total consideration of approximately $159.5 million. As of February 19, 2010, the Company had 12.4 million Common Shares remaining available for issuance under the ATM program.  

Depending on its analysis of market prices, economic conditions, and other opportunities for the investment of available capital, the Company may repurchase its Common Shares pursuant to its existing share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Trustees. The Company repurchased $1.1 million (47,450 shares at an average price per share of $23.69) of its Common Shares during the year ended December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had authorization to repurchase an additional $466.5 million of its shares. See Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  

Depending on its analysis of prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, the Company may from time to time seek to repurchase and retire its outstanding debt in open market or privately negotiated transactions.

The Company generally expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including capital expenditures related to maintaining its existing properties and certain scheduled unsecured note and mortgage note repayments, through its working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Under normal operating conditions, the Company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payments of distributions. However, there may be times when the Company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions, which may cause the Company to consider reducing its distributions and/or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference. Should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature, the Companys financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels. The Company reduced its quarterly common share dividend beginning with the dividend for the third quarter of 2009, from $0.4825 per share (an annual rate of $1.93 per share) to $0.3375 per share (an annual rate of $1.35 per share). The Company believes that its expected 2010 operating cash flow is sufficient to cover capital expenditures and distributions.  

43  

Table of Contents 

The Company also expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities, property acquisitions, financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities, including additional OP Units, and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties as well as joint ventures. In addition, the Company has significant unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings in the event that the public capital markets are unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital is too high. The fair value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Company must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and line of credit. Of the $18.5 billion in investment in real estate on the Companys balance sheet at December 31, 2009, $11.2 billion or 60.9%, was unencumbered. However, there can be no assurances that these sources of capital will be available to the Company in the future on acceptable terms or otherwise.  

As of the date of this filing, the Operating Partnerships senior debt credit ratings from Standard & Poors (S&P), Moodys and Fitch are BBB+, Baal and A-, respectively. As of the date of this filing, the Companys preferred equity ratings from S&P, Moodys and Fitch are BBB-, Baa2 and BBB, respectively. During the third quarter of 2009, Moodys and Fitch placed both the Company and the Operating Partnership on negative outlook.  

The Operating Partnership has a $1.5 billion long-term revolving credit facility with available borrowings as of February 19, 2010 of $1.36 billion (net of $65.2 million which was restricted/dedicated to support letters of credit and net of a $75.0 million commitment from a now bankrupt financial institution) that matures in February 2012 (See Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion). This facility may, among other potential uses, be used to fund property acquisitions, costs for certain properties under development and short-term liquidity requirements. As of February 19, 2010, $180.0 million was outstanding under this facility. The Company expects to repay essentially all of the outstanding balance under the line as dispositions close and restricted 1031 proceeds are released from escrow.  

See Note 21 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to December 31, 2009.  

Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate  

Our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property. We track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories:  

       Replacements (inside the unit). These include:  

       flooring such as carpets, hardwood, vinyl, linoleum or tile;  

       appliances;  

       mechanical equipment such as individual furnace/air units, hot water heaters, etc;  

       furniture and fixtures such as kitchen/bath cabinets, light fixtures, ceiling fans, sinks, tubs, toilets, mirrors, countertops, etc; and  

       blinds/shades.  

All replacements are depreciated over a five-year estimated useful life. We expense as incurred all make-ready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning, interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above.  

       Building improvements (outside the unit). These include:  

       roof replacement and major repairs;  

       paving or major resurfacing of parking lots, curbs and sidewalks;  

       amenities and common areas such as pools, exterior sports and playground equipment, lobbies, clubhouses, laundry rooms, alarm and security systems and offices;  

       major building mechanical equipment systems;  

       interior and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding;  

       major landscaping and grounds improvement; and  

       vehicles and office and maintenance equipment.  

All building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten-year estimated useful life. We capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item: (i) exceeds $2,500 (selected projects must exceed $10,000); (ii) extends the useful life of the asset; and (iii) improves the value of the asset.

For the year ended December 31, 2009, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $123.9 million. This includes the following (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):  

Capital Expenditures to Real Estate  

For the Year Ended December 31, 2009  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Total Units  Excludes 8,086 unconsolidated units and 4,595 military housing units, for which capital expenditures to real estate are self-funded and do not consolidate into the Companys results.  

 (2) Replacements  For same store properties includes $28.0 million spent on various assets related to unit renovations/rehabs (primarily kitchens and baths) designed to reposition these assets for higher rental levels in their respective markets.  

 (3) Same Store Properties  Primarily includes all properties acquired or completed and stabilized prior to January 1, 2008, less properties subsequently sold.  

 (4) Non-Same Store Properties  Primarily includes all properties acquired during 2008 and 2009, plus any properties in lease-up and not stabilized as of January 1, 2008. Per unit amounts are based on a weighted average of 9,823 units.  

 (5) Other  Primarily includes expenditures for properties sold during the period.  

For the year ended December 31, 2008, our actual improvements to real estate totaled approximately $169.8 million. This includes the following (amounts in thousands except for unit and per unit amounts):  

Capital Expenditures to Real Estate  

For the Year Ended December 31, 2008  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1) Total Units  Excludes 9,776 unconsolidated units and 4,709 military housing units, for which capital expenditures to real estate are self-funded and do not consolidate into the Companys results.  

 (2) Established Properties  Wholly Owned Properties acquired prior to January 1, 2006.  

 (3) New Acquisition Properties  Wholly Owned Properties acquired during 2006, 2007 and 2008. Per unit amounts are based on a weighted average of 18,983 units.  

 (4) Other  Includes properties either partially owned or sold during the period, commercial space, corporate housing and condominium conversions. Also includes $34.2 million included in replacements spent on various assets related to major renovations and repositioning of these assets.  

The Company incurred less in capital expenditures in 2009 primarily due to continued efforts to limit the scope of projects and greater cost controls on vendors. For 2010, the Company estimates that it will spend approximately $1,075 per unit of capital expenditures for its same store properties inclusive of unit renovation/rehab costs, or $825 per unit excluding unit renovation/rehab costs. The above assumptions are based on current expectations and are forward-looking.  

During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Companys total non-real estate capital additions, such as computer software, computer equipment, and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the Companys property management offices and its corporate offices, were approximately $2.0 million. The Company expects to fund approximately $1.6 million in total additions to non-real estate property in 2010. The above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward-looking.  

45  

Table of Contents 

Improvements to real estate and additions to non-real estate property are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow.  

Derivative Instruments  

In the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes. The Company seeks to limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments.  

The Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors. When viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge, the Company has not sustained a material loss from these instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place.  

See Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at December 31, 2009.  

Other  

Total distributions paid in January 2010 amounted to $100.7 million (excluding distributions on Partially Owned Properties), which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2009.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  

The Company has co-invested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the Companys liquidity, cash flows, capital resources, credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities. During 2000 and 2001, the Company entered into institutional ventures with an unaffiliated partner. At the respective closing dates, the Company sold and/or contributed 45 properties containing 10,846 units to these ventures and retained a 25% ownership interest in the ventures. The Companys joint venture partner contributed cash equal to 75% of the agreed-upon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures, which was then distributed to the Company. The Companys strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets. The Company sold seven properties consisting of 1,684 units (including one property containing 250 units which was acquired by the Company), three properties consisting of 670 units and one property consisting of 400 units during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company and its joint venture partner currently intend to wind up these investments over the next few years by selling the related assets, which may involve refinancing the assets as a majority of the debt encumbering them matures in 2010 and early 2011. The Company cannot estimate what, if any, profit it will receive from these dispositions or if the Company will in fact receive its equity back.  

As of December 31, 2009, the Company has four projects totaling 1,700 units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through June 30, 2011. The development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in Note 18 of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.  

See also Notes 2 and 6 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Companys investments in partially owned entities.  

The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of December 31, 2009:

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements.  

The Companys significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended December 31, 2009 and are consistent with the year ended December 31, 2008, except with respect to noncontrolling interests and convertible debt as further described in Note 2.  

The Company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies. These critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. With respect to these critical accounting policies, management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented. The five critical accounting policies are:  

Acquisition of Investment Properties  

The Company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data. The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.  

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its investments in real estate, for indicators of permanent impairment. The judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance, market conditions and legal and environmental concerns, as well as the Companys ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset. Future events could occur which would cause the Company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted.  

Depreciation of Investment in Real Estate  

The Company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a 30-year estimated useful life, building improvements over a 5-year to 10-year estimated useful life and both the furniture, fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a 5-year estimated useful life, all of which are judgmental determinations.  

Cost Capitalization  

See the Capitalization of Fixed Assets and Improvements to Real Estate section for a discussion of the Companys policy with respect to capitalization vs. expensing of fixed asset/repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the Company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and/or renovation projects. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property.

For all development projects, the Company uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred. The Company capitalizes interest, real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities, with capitalization ceasing no later than 90 days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy. These costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction-in-progress for each specific property. The Company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on-site employees working directly at our properties, except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired.  

Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Including Derivative Instruments  

The valuation of financial instruments requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its financial instruments, including its derivative instruments, on listed market prices and third party quotes. Where these are not available, the Company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments.  

Funds From Operations  

For the year ended December 31, 2009, Funds From Operations (FFO) available to Common Shares and Units decreased $2.9 million, or 0.5%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008, FFO available to Common Shares and Units decreased $95.0 million, or 13.3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007.  

The following is a reconciliation of net income to FFO available to Common Shares and Units for each of the five years ended December 31, 2009:

 (1)  The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) defines funds from operations (FFO) (April 2002 White Paper) as net income (computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP)), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis. The April 2002 White Paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from FFO for previously depreciated operating properties only. Once the Company commences the conversion of units to condominiums, it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property. FFO available to Common Shares and Units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to Common Shares and

 reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the Operating Partnership in exchange for OP Units are collectively referred to as the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership. Subject to certain restrictions, the Noncontrolling Interests  Operating Partnership may exchange their OP Units for EQR Common Shares on a one-for-one basis.  

 (2) The Company believes that FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company, because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units can help compare the operating performance of a companys real estate between periods or as compared to different companies. FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units do not represent net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income, net income available to Common Shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP or as measures of liquidity. The Companys calculation of FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units may differ from other real estate companies due to, among other items, variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other real estate companies.  

 (3) Effective January 1, 2009, companies are required to retrospectively expense certain implied costs of the option value related to convertible debt. As a result, net income, FFO and FFO available to Common Shares and Units have all been reduced by approximately $10.6 million, $13.3 million, $10.1 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
