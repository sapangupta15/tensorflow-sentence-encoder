Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

General Overview  

Overview  

We own, operate and lease over 23,000 towers for wireless communications, including the towers acquired in the Global Signal Merger (see Item 7. MD&AGeneral OverviewAcquisition of Global Signal). Revenues generated from our core site rental business represented 93% of our 2007 consolidated revenues. CCUSA, our largest operating segment, accounted for 94% of our 2007 site rental revenues, of which 69% were derived from the four largest wireless carriers in the U.S. The vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and has been contracted for in a prior year. See Item 1. Business.  

The following are certain highlights of our business fundamentals, as further discussed in this Form 10-K, including in Item 1. Business and this MD&A:  

       potential growth resulting from wireless network expansion;  

       site rental revenues under long-term leases with contracted escalations;  

       revenues predominately from large wireless carriers;  

       majority of land under our towers under long-term control;  

       relatively fixed tower operating costs;  

       high incremental cash flows on organic revenue growth;  

       minimal sustaining capital expenditure requirements;  

       majority of our outstanding debt rated investment grade and has fixed rate coupons; and  

       significant cash flows from operations.  

Our strategy is to increase long-term shareholder value by translating anticipated future growth in our core site rental business into growth in our results of operations on a per share basis. The key elements of our strategy are (see Item 1. Business for further discussion):  

       to organically grow revenues and cash flows from our towers by co-locating additional tenants on our existing towers; and  

       to allocate capital efficiently as we (1) opportunistically purchase our own common stock, (2) enter into strategic tower acquisitions, (3) selectively construct or acquire towers, (4) acquire the land on which towers are located, (5) improve and structurally enhance our existing towers, (6) construct distributed antenna systems, and (7) purchase or redeem our debt or preferred stock.  

Our strategy is based on our belief that opportunities will be created by the expected continuation of growth in the wireless communications industry, which depends on the demand for wireless telephony and data services by consumers. As a result of such expected growth in the wireless communications industry, we believe that the demand for our towers will continue and result in organic growth of our revenues due to the co-location of additional tenants on our existing towers. We expect that new tenant additions or modifications of existing installations (collectively referred to as tenant additions) on our existing towers should result in significant incremental cash flow due to the relatively fixed costs to operate a tower (which tend to increase at approximately the rate of inflation). The following is a discussion of certain growth trends in the wireless communications industry (see Item 1. Business for further discussion):  

       Wireless carriers have focused on improving network quality and coverage.  

       There has been significant growth in wireless minutes of use, the volume of wireless data services and text messaging, and the number of new wireless subscribers.  

       Our customers have introduced, and we believe they plan to continue to introduce, next generation wireless technologies, including 3G and wireless data technology, such as email, internet and mobile video.  

       We have seen and anticipate there could be other new entrants into the wireless communications industry.  

       We expect the recent FCC spectrum license auctions and future auctions should enable next generation networks and possibly enable one or more new entrants into the wireless communications industry.

The impact of anticipated increases to site rental revenues from the demand for antenna space on our towers may be tempered somewhat by recent carrier consolidation (including Cingular Wireless [now known as AT&T] merging with AT&T Wireless in 2004 and Sprint merging with Nextel in 2005), which could result in duplicate or overlapping networks. However, we expect that the termination of leases as a result of recent carrier consolidation and related duplicate or overlapping networks will be spread over multiple quarters as existing lease obligations expire. In addition, we believe we are adding more leases from all of our customers than the total number of leases we believe will eventually be terminated as a result of the two mergers noted above. Consequently, we currently do not believe that lease terminations from carrier consolidation will have a material adverse affect on our results.  

Slow downs in the U.S. economy, including the wireless communication industry, may reduce consumer demand for wireless communications, cause carriers to delay improvements to network quality and coverage and delay or abandon introduction of next generation wireless technologies, which in turn could reduce demand for our towers. Many commentators have expressed uncertainty about the direction and relative strength of the U.S. economy. Currently, we have not experienced a slow down in new leasing of our towers.  

In addition to consumer demand for wireless services as discussed above, factors affecting the growth in our revenues include: (1) availability and location of our towers and alternative sites, (2) availability and cost of capital to our customers, (3) our customers willingness to co-locate, (4) local restrictions on the proliferation of towers, (5) technological changes affecting the number of communications sites needed to provide wireless communication services to a given geographical area, and (6) our ability to efficiently satisfy our customers service requirements.  

Acquisition of Global Signal  

On January 12, 2007, we completed the Global Signal Merger in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $4.0 billion, exclusive of debt of approximately $1.8 billion that remained outstanding as obligations after the Global Signal Merger. As a result of the completion of the Global Signal Merger, we issued approximately 98.1 million shares of common stock and paid the maximum cash consideration of $550 million to the stockholders of Global Signal and reserved for issuance approximately 0.6 million shares of common stock issuable pursuant to Global Signal warrants. We financed the GS $550M Consideration primarily with cash received from the issuance of tower revenue notes in November 2006. We entered into the Global Signal Merger primarily because of anticipated growth opportunities in the Global Signal tower portfolio, including through leveraging our management team and customer service across an enhanced national footprint. We believe such opportunities for growth will be driven by the previously mentioned growth trends in the wireless communications industry.  

The Global Signal Merger significantly increased our tower portfolio (by 10,749 towers) and significantly impacted the comparability of our results of operations to prior years. Specifically, the Global Signal Merger is primarily responsible for the significant increase between 2006 and 2007 in our site rental revenues, site rental costs of operations, general and administrative expenses, integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion and income tax benefits. Global Signal revenues, cost of operations and gross margins for the year ended December 31, 2006 were approximately $496.0 million, $221.2 million and $274.7 million, respectively. Although the Global Signal Merger resulted in an increase in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars, our general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues. We incurred costs of $25.4 million for 2007 related to our integration of Global Signals operations and tower portfolio into our policies, procedures, operations and systems. We anticipate the integration of Global Signals operations and tower portfolio will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2008. The change from a provision to a benefit for income taxes between 2006 and 2007 was related to our change from a net deferred tax asset position to a net deferred tax liability position that resulted from the deferred tax liability of $556.6 million recorded as part of the allocation of the purchase price of the Global Signal Merger offset by the reversal of our federal valuation allowance of $259.7 million.  

See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the Global Signal Merger, including (1) the allocation of the purchase price and (2) our unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 as if the Global Signal Merger were completed as of the beginning of each such period. See also notes 4, 5, 7, 8 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.

Results of Operations  

The following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business, Item 7. MD&ALiquidity and Capital Resources and our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion of our results of operations is based on consolidated financials statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals in the U.S. that require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts (see Item 7. MD&AAccounting and Reporting MattersCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements).  

The construction and acquisition of towers affects the year-to-year comparability of our results due to the fact that our results only reflect revenues generated from these towers following the date of their construction or acquisition. A large majority of the increase between 2006 and 2007 in our site rental revenues, site rental costs of operations, general and administrative expenses, integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion and income tax benefits is attributable to the Global Signal Merger. See Item 7. MD&AGeneral OverviewAcquisition of Global Signal. In addition to the towers acquired in the Global Signal Merger, we built or acquired 483, 487 and 188 towers in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively.

2006 and 2007. Our consolidated results of operations for 2006 and 2007, respectively, predominately consist of our CCUSA segment, which accounted for (1) 92% and 94% of consolidated net revenues, (2) 92% and 94% of consolidated gross margins, and (3) 97% and 102% of consolidated net loss. Our operating segment results for 2006 and 2007, including CCUSA, are discussed below (see Item 7. MD&AResults of OperationsComparison of Operating Segments).  

Net revenues for 2007 increased by $597.3 million, or 76%, from 2006, of which site rental revenues represented 99% of the overall increase. This increase in site rental revenues was driven by (1) the towers acquired in connection with the Global Signal Merger, and to a lesser extent, (2) tenant additions on our pre-Global Signal Merger towers (occurring during or after 2006), and (3) the 474 towers acquired from Mountain Union. Tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth trends in the wireless communications industry.  

Site rental gross margins (site rental revenues less site rental costs of operations) for 2007 increased by $358.9 million, or 74%, from 2006. The increase in the site rental gross margins was predominately driven by the previously mentioned increase in site rental revenues. We expect that future increases in site rental revenues resulting from tenant additions on our towers will have a high incremental margin (percentage of revenue growth converted to gross margin) given the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers.  

In addition, the Global Signal Merger resulted in (1) an increase in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars but a decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues as a result of synergies from operating a larger tower portfolio, (2) the vast majority of the increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, (3) the integration costs for 2007, (4) additional interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs relating to the $1.8 billion of mortgage loans, and (5) our recording of income tax benefits resulting from the deferred tax liability recorded in purchase accounting that resulted in a change from a net deferred tax asset position to a net deferred tax liability position.  

Our net loss for 2007 increased by $180.9 million from 2006, predominately due to (1) the net impact of the previously mentioned Global Signal Merger, (2) an impairment charge of $75.6 million relating to our investment in FiberTower, and (3) asset write-down charges ($57.6 million) and restructuring charges ($3.1 million) related to Modeo totaling $60.7 million, offset by (4) growth in our site rental business on pre-Global Signal Merger towers.  

Pro forma 2006 and 2007. The following is a discussion of our unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations as if the Global Signal Merger were completed as of January 1 for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007. These unaudited pro forma amounts are presented and discussed for illustrative purposes only, are not necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations and reflect cost savings from the Global Signal Merger in the period in which such cost savings are achieved. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for a presentation of our pro forma condensed consolidated results of operations.  

Pro forma net revenues for 2007 increased by $103.2 million, or 8%, from 2006. Site rental revenues, which represented 93% of the overall increase in pro forma net revenues, increased by $95.6 million, or 8%, from 2006 primarily due to tenant additions across our combined tower portfolio. The increase in pro forma site rental revenues was driven by tenant additions across our entire tower portfolio and to a lesser extent, the 474 towers acquired from Mountain Union. Pro forma site rental gross margins for 2007 increased by $74.2 million, or 10%, from 2006. The increase in the pro forma site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned increase in site rental revenues.  

Our pro forma loss from continuing operations for 2007 increased by $75.8 million from 2006 predominately due to (1) an increase of $86.0 million in interest expense related to additional borrowings used to fund the GS $550M Consideration and purchases of our common stock, (2) an impairment charge of $75.6 million relating to our investment in FiberTower, and (3) asset write-down charges ($57.6 million) and restructuring charges ($3.1 million) related to Modeo totaling $60.7 million, offset by growth in our site rental business across our combined tower portfolio. In addition, integration costs of $25.4 million for 2007 were offset by a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $26.8 million, or 16%, from 2006 due predominately to cost synergies achieved as a result of operating a larger tower portfolio.

2005 and 2006. Our consolidated results of operations for 2005 and 2006, respectively, predominately consist of our CCUSA segment, which accounted for (1) 92% and 92% of consolidated net revenues, (2) 92% and 92% of consolidated gross margins, and (3) 98% and 97% of consolidated net loss. Our operating segment results for 2005 and 2006, including CCUSA, are discussed below (see Item 7. MD&AResults of OperationsComparison of Operating Segments).  

Net revenues for 2006 increased by $111.5 million, or 17%, from 2005. The increase for 2006 resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of $99.6 million, which represents 89% of the overall increase in net revenues. The increase in site rental revenue for 2006 was primarily driven by (1) tenant additions or modifications to existing installations, (2) the leases (as originally acquired) related to the combined 941 towers from Trintel and Mountain Union, and (3) an increase in non-cash straight-line rents primarily relating to the renewal of certain leases.  

Site rental gross margins (site rental revenues less site rental costs of operations) for 2006 increased by $84.5 million, or 21%, from 2005. The incremental margin is 85% of the related increase in site rental revenues for 2006. The increase in the site rental gross margin percentage and the related high incremental margin percentage was driven by tenant additions on existing towers that did not result in significant incremental tower operating costs due to the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers.  

During 2005, we refinanced $1.5 billion of our high yield notes with proceeds from the $1.9 billion tower revenue notes resulting in a reduction in our weighted-average interest rate and simplification of our capital structure. During 2005, we recorded an aggregate loss of $283.8 million on the purchase and redemption of the $1.5 billion high yield notes and a portion of our 4% convertible notes. During 2006, we increased our debt by approximately $1.2 billion or 55% from 2005 primarily by borrowing $1.55 billion of tower revenue notes in November 2006, which in part refinanced $1 billion of outstanding debt under a credit facility. The proceeds of our 2006 borrowings were used to fund purchases of our common stock, the GS $550M Consideration related to the Global Signal Merger, and the acquisition of Mountain Union. The increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2006 of $28.5 million or 21% from 2005 was driven by the increase in debt partially offset by a reduction in our weighted average interest rates. See Item 7. MD&ALiquidity and Capital Resources and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  

Net loss for 2006 improved by $358.0 million from 2005. The improvement in the net loss was primarily driven by (1) the $278.0 million decrease in losses on purchases and redemption of debt related to the refinancing of $1.6 billion of debt during 2005, (2) the $97.2 million increase in operating income resulting primarily from tenant additions on our towers, offset by (3) the $28.5 million increase in interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs as a result of an increase in our debt, partially reduced by the decrease in our weighted average interest rates.  

The dividends on preferred stock in 2006 of $20.8 million are related to our 6.25% convertible preferred stock. The decrease in the preferred stock dividends of $28.6 million from 2005 relates to the redemption of the 8 1 /4% convertible preferred stock in December 2005. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.  

Comparison of Operating Segments  

Our reportable operating segments for 2007 are (1) CCUSA, primarily consisting of our U.S. (including Puerto Rico) tower operations, and (2) CCAL, our Australian tower operations. Our financial results are reported to management and the board of directors in this manner. We have reclassified the Corporate Office and Other segment into the CCUSA segment, reflecting the significance of the CCUSA segment to our consolidated business following the Global Signal Merger. We have reclassified the Emerging Businesses segment, consisting of our Modeo business, into the CCUSA segment following the lease of the Spectrum and write-off of substantially all of the Modeo assets other than the Spectrum (see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements). Segment information for all periods has been reclassified to reflect these changes in reportable segments.  

See note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for segment results and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA (defined below).  

Our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate our operating performance and operating segments is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (Adjusted EBITDA). Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including   

26  

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

 companies in the tower sector, and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). 

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, losses on purchases and redemptions of debt, interest and other income (expense), interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, impairment of available-for-sale securities, benefit (provision) for income taxes, minority interests, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense (see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements). The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for our operating segments is set forth in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. Adjusted EBITDA is not intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is discussed further under Item 7. MD&AAccounting and Reporting MattersNon-GAAP Financial Measures.  

CCUSA2006 and 2007. Net revenues for 2007 increased by $576.3 million, or 79%, from 2006. This increase in net revenues resulted from an increase in site rental revenues of $570.9 million, or 89%, for the same periods. This increase in site rental revenues was driven by (1) the towers acquired in connection with the Global Signal Merger, and to a lesser extent, (2) new tenant additions, and (3) the 474 towers acquired from Mountain Union. Tenant additions were influenced by the previously mentioned growth in the wireless communications industry. Although we continue to derive a large portion of our site rental revenues from the four largest carriers in the U.S., we have experienced an increase in tenant additions during 2007 from emerging wireless carriers and second tier carriers, such as those offering wireless data technologies and flat rate calling plans.  

Network services and other revenues for 2007 increased by $5.4 million, or 6%, from 2006. The increase in network services and other revenues was as a result of performing services on a larger portfolio of towers due to the Global Signal Merger. Global Signal did not operate a network services business, so the network services and other revenues performed on the Global Signal towers increased during each quarter of 2007 as we began marketing services for those towers. Exclusive of network services and other revenues derived from the Global Signal towers, network services and other revenues declined modestly from 2006 to 2007. The network services business is typically non-recurring, and the volume of activity can vary significantly from period to period in relation to tenant additions on our towers.  

Site rental gross margins for 2007 increased by $345.6 million, or 77%, from 2006. The increase in the site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned 89% increase in site rental revenues primarily driven by the towers acquired in connection with the Global Signal Merger and, to a lesser extent, from tenant additions. Site rental gross margins as a percentage of site rental revenues for 2007 decreased by 4.2 percentage points from 2006 to 65% primarily as a result of the less mature Global Signal towers that have lower revenues per tower and higher ground rent expense as a percentage of revenues than our pre-Global Signal Merger towers. We believe the Global Signal towers have significant additional revenue and margin growth opportunities provided by potential future tenant additions on those towers.  

General and administrative expenses for 2007 increased by $33.8 million from 2006 but decreased to 10% of total net revenues from 13% of total net revenues. General and administrative expenses are inclusive of stock-based compensation charges as discussed further below. The increase in general and administrative expenses in nominal dollars was primarily related to headcount additions and related employee costs as a result of the Global Signal Merger partially offset by cost reductions from the termination of the Modeo employees (see notes 17 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements). The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues was driven by synergies from operating a larger tower portfolio as a result of the Global Signal Merger.  

Adjusted EBITDA for 2007 increased by $319.5 million, or 80%, from 2006. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the same factors that drove the increase of 89% in our site rental revenues including the towers acquired in connection with the Global Signal Merger and tenant additions.  

We recognized stock-based compensation expense from continuing operations of $14.9 million and $23.5 million, respectively, for 2006 and 2007. The primary reason for fluctuations in the stock-based compensation expense during 2006 to 2007 is (1) accelerated vesting of awards granted in 2004 and 2005 and (2) our grants in 2006 and 2007. During 2005, restricted stock granted during 2004 and 2005 accelerated vested based on the market performance of our common stock. This accelerated vesting resulted in the recognition of $15.2 million of expense   

27  

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

 in 2005 that was originally to be recognized over the original vesting period (through 2009 and 2010). In addition, during 2006 and 2007 we granted 1.2 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively, of restricted stock with grant date weighted-average requisite service periods of 2.5 and 2.1 years, respectively. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.  

In July 2007, we entered into a lease of our Spectrum. The Spectrum is leased to a venture formed by Telcom Ventures, LLC and Columbia Capital LLC (CCTV) for a $13 million annual lease fee with an initial term from July 23, 2007 until October 1, 2013. As a result, we eliminated substantially all of the future Modeo operating and administrative expenses, which for 2007 were $4.0 million. In addition, for 2007, we recorded (1) site revenues of $5.7 million from the Spectrum lease, (2) asset write-down charges of $57.6 million as a result of the write-off of substantially all of our Modeo assets other than the Spectrum, and (3) restructuring charges of $3.1 million related to the termination of the Modeo employees. See note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.  

Integration costs for 2007 were $25.4 million and related to the Global Signal Merger. These integration costs included, among other things, expenses for retention bonus obligations with employees of the former Global Signal, costs for contracted employees directly related to the integration and stock-based compensation charges with respect to restricted stock awards assumed in the Global Signal Merger. See Item 7. MD&AGeneral OverviewAcquisition of Global Signal and notes 2 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements.  

Depreciation, amortization and accretion for 2007 increased by $254.3 million, or 99%, from 2006. The vast majority of this increase was related to the depreciation and amortization attributable to property and equipment and intangible assets recorded in connection with the purchase price allocation for the Global Signal Merger. Our tower assets are recorded at cost (estimated replacement cost for those acquired) and are depreciated using a useful life that is defined as the period equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the underlying ground lease (including renewal options). See Item 7. MD&AAccounting and Reporting MattersCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates.  

Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2007 increased by $188.0 million, or 118%, from 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to additional indebtedness. The components of the increase in indebtedness primarily include (1) the issuance of the tower revenue notes ($1.55 billion) in November 2006, (2) the mortgage loans ($1.8 billion) that remained outstanding as obligations after the Global Signal Merger, and (3) the issuance of term loans ($650.0 million) during the first half of 2007. This additional indebtedness was offset by our repayment of $1.0 billion of borrowings under a credit facility using proceeds of the $1.55 billion tower revenue notes. Exclusive of the mortgage loans, our net increase in debt during 2007 primarily related to (1) funding the GS $550M Consideration and (2) purchases of our common stock in 2007. See Item 7. MD&ALiquidity and Capital ResourcesOverview.  

In 2007, we recorded an impairment charge of $75.6 million related to a decline in the value of our investment in FiberTower that was deemed other-than-temporary. Future declines in the stock price of FiberTower may be determined to be other-than-temporary and result in further write-downs of our investment. These potential future write-downs are limited to the carrying value of our investment of $60.1 million as of December 31, 2007. See Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Benefit (provision) for income taxes for 2007 was a benefit of $95.3 million compared to a provision of $0.5 million for 2006. We recorded a deferred tax liability of $556.6 million as part of the allocation of the purchase price of the Global Signal Merger, which was offset in part by the reversal of our federal valuation allowance of $259.7 million. As a result, we (1) are no longer in a net deferred tax asset position, (2) are generally no longer recording a valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets because of our historical net operating losses, and (3) can generally record the benefit of tax impacts of our results in the statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss).  

Income from discontinued operations of $5.7 million for 2006 relates primarily to the reversal of liabilities previously established in conjunction with the sale of our former CCUK operations, as a result of the termination of related contingencies during 2006.  

Net income (loss) for 2007 was a loss of $227.9 million, an increase from a loss of $40.8 million for 2006. The increased loss was primarily due to (1) the increases in depreciation, amortization and accretion and interest expense, all of which were predominantly related to the Global Signal Merger, (2) an impairment charge of $75.6 million related to our investment in FiberTower, and (3) asset write-down charges ($57.6 million) and restructuring   

28

Index to Financial Statements 

 charges ($3.1 million) related to Modeo totaling $60.7 million, partially offset by (1) the increase in Adjusted EBITDA as a result of the towers acquired in the Global Signal Merger and growth in our site rental business and (2) our benefit for income taxes.  

CCAL2006 and 2007. The increases and decreases between 2006 and 2007 are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations. Changes between the two periods were influenced by the average exchange rates from 2006 and 2007 of 0.7536 and 0.8387, respectively. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  

Total net revenues for 2007 increased by $21.0 million, or 35%, from 2006. The increase in total net revenues was due to growth in site rental revenues primarily related to (1) tenant additions on our towers, (2) exchange rate fluctuations, (3) contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations, and (4) new towers acquired after the third quarter of 2006. See Item 1. BusinessThe CompanyCCAL.  

Adjusted EBITDA for 2007 increased by $11.7 million, or 40%, from 2006. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the same factors that drove the increase in site rental revenues. More specifically, site rental gross margins increased by $13.3 million, or 37%, to 70% of site rental revenues, for 2007 from $36.4 million, or 69% of site rental revenues, for 2006. The $13.3 million incremental margin represents 71% of the related increase in site rental revenues.  

In May 2007, CCAL (our 77.6% majority-owned subsidiary) issued a capital return of approximately $166.0 million, including $37.2 million to the minority shareholders of CCAL. The capital return was funded by CCOC through an intercompany borrowing by CCAL. Upon issuance of the capital return, we recorded a reduction in additional paid-in capital of $8.9 million as a result of the capital return to the CCAL minority shareholders exceeding the carrying value of the minority interests in CCAL. The intercompany borrowing and related capital return was issued to increase the leverage of the CCAL business. The losses applicable to the minority interest shareholders will be included in our results in the future as long as their share of the CCAL losses exceeds their equity interests.  

Net income (loss) for 2007 was income of $5.1 million, an improvement of $6.2 million from 2006. The change from net loss to net income was primarily driven by the same factors that drove the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by the increase in stock-based compensation charges of $2.9 million (see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements).  

CCUSA2005 and 2006. Net revenues for 2006 increased by $106.2 million, or 17%, from 2005. Of the $106.2 million increase in net revenues, $94.4 million, or 89%, relates to site rental revenues. Network services revenues for 2006 increased by $11.8 million from 2005. Network services revenues should continue to be somewhat volatile as these revenues, unlike site rental revenues, are typically not under long-term contract.  

The increase in site rental revenue for 2006 was primarily driven by the following that occurred during or after 2005 (1) tenant additions, (2) the combined 941 towers acquired from Trintel and Mountain Union, and (3) an increase in non-cash straight-line rents primarily relating to the renewal of certain leases.  

General and administrative expenses for 2006 decreased by $9.8 million to 13% of total net revenues from 16% of total net revenues for 2005. General and administrative expenses for 2006 included stock-based compensation expense of $14.5 million, which represents a decrease of $8.3 million from 2005. Stock-based compensation expense decreased from 2005 primarily as a result of accelerated vesting of shares of restricted stock awards during 2005 based on the performance of our stock. General and administrative expenses were also reduced as a result of the consolidation of certain management functions in 2005. The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues is primarily a function of an increase in revenue without any significant increases in headcount as well as the decrease in stock-based compensation expense.  

Adjusted EBITDA for 2006 increased by $85.0 million, or 27%, from 2005. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the high incremental margin from tenant additions on existing towers that did not result in significant incremental tower operating costs due to the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers. More specifically, site rental gross margins increased by $77.9 million, or 21%, to 70% of site rental revenues, for 2006 from $370.0 million, or 67% of site rental revenues, for 2005. The $77.9 million incremental margin represents 83% of the related increase in site rental revenues, reflecting the relatively fixed nature of the costs to operate our towers.

Depreciation, amortization and accretion for 2006 increased by $3.8 million, or 2%, from 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the combined 941 Trintel and Mountain Union towers by CCUSA and an increase in our tower assets as a result of capital expenditures for both the modification to and maintenance on tower assets (see Item 7. MD&ALiquidity and Capital ResourcesInvesting Activities for a further discussion of our capital expenditures), offset by the effects of our purchase of, or extension of ground leases relating to, the land on which our towers reside that resulted in increases in the useful life of our towers.  

Operating income for 2006 increased by $91.0 million, or 304%, from 2005. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by (1) the aforementioned $77.9 million increase in site rental gross margin and (2) the $6.2 million increase in network services and other gross margin, which is a reflection of our customers continued demand for our installation services.  

Losses on the purchases and redemptions of debt for 2006 decreased by $278.0 million from 2005. The decrease is primarily related to refinancing activities in 2005 that were completed to reduce our weighted-average cost of debt and simplify our capital structure. For 2005, the loss of $283.8 million related to the purchase and redemption of $1.6 billion of our debt securities repaid with proceeds from the tower revenue notes issued in 2005.  

Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs for 2006 increased by $29.1 million from 2005. The increase is primarily attributable to the approximately $1.2 billion increase in debt, including the borrowings under our credit facility in June 2006 and the tower revenue notes issued November 2006, offset by the refinancing of debt in June 2005, which reduced the weighted-average coupon on our debt, and the repayment of our previously outstanding credit facility entered into in July 2005. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.  

Our financing activities in 2005 and 2006 reflect (1) our focus to decrease our cost of debt and (2) our desire to position ourselves to have the financial flexibility to utilize our internally generated capital for investments which we believe satisfy our investment return criteria, including opportunistic share purchases, new assets and further investments in our existing assets (see Item 7. MD&ALiquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion).  

Income from discontinued operations of $5.7 million for 2006, relates primarily to the reversal of liabilities previously established in conjunction with the sale of our former CCUK operations, as a result of the termination of related contingencies during 2006. Income from discontinued operations for 2005, relates primarily to OpenCell, which was sold on May 9, 2005.  

The cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for asset retirement obligations in 2005 represents the charge recorded upon adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement ObligationsAn interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.  

Net loss for 2006 decreased by $352.1 million to $40.8 million from $392.9 million for 2005. The reduction in net loss was primarily driven by a $278.0 million decrease in losses on the purchase and redemption of debt, $91.0 million increase in operating income and $29.1 million increase in interest expense and deferred financing costs as a result of an increase in debt, partially reduced by the decrease in our weighted average interest rate.  

CCAL2005 and 2006. The increases and decreases between 2005 and 2006 are inclusive of exchange rate fluctuations. Exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the changes between these two periods. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Total net revenues for 2006 increased by $5.3 million, or 10%, from 2005. This increase is predominately driven by growth in site rental revenues, which reflects tenant additions on our towers and escalations on existing leases with variable escalations.

Index to Financial Statements 

Adjusted EBITDA for 2006 increased by $7.4 million, or 34%, from 2005. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by the incremental margin from the tenant additions on existing towers and contractual escalations on existing leases with variable escalations. More specifically, site rental gross margins increased by $6.6 million, or 22%, to 69% of site rental revenues, for 2006 from $29.8 million, or 63% of site rental revenues, for 2005. The $6.6 million incremental margin represents 127% of the related increase in site rental revenues, primarily reflecting an improvement in the costs to operate our CCAL towers.  

Operating income (loss) for 2006 improved by $6.2 million from 2005. The change from operating loss to operating income is primarily due to the $6.6 million increase in gross margin from site rental revenues, offset slightly by an increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of increased employee related costs, including additional stock-based compensation expense as a result of the modification of the CCAL option plan to enable employees to require CCAL to periodically settle CCAL options in cash.  

Net loss for 2006 improved by $5.9 million from 2005. The improvement in net loss is primarily driven by the same factors that drove the improvement in operating income (loss), partially offset by the minority interest shareholders 22% portion of the results.  

Impact of Inflation  

Other than the towers acquired from Global Signal, the majority of our towers were acquired between 1999 and 2001; tower assets and related depreciation expense do not reflect the impact of inflation occurring subsequent to the acquisition of these towers. The impact of inflation on our results of operations for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 was not significant.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Overview   

Strategy. We seek to invest our available capital among the investment alternatives that we believe exhibit sufficient potential to improve our long-term results of operations on a per share basis. We have and we expect to continue to invest in discretionary investments such as (1) opportunistically purchasing our own common stock, (2) entering into strategic acquisitions of tower businesses, (3) selectively constructing or acquiring towers, (4) acquiring the land on which towers are located, (5) improving and structurally enhancing our existing towers, (6) constructing distributed antenna systems, and (7) purchasing or redeeming our debt or preferred stock. See Item 1. Business for a further discussion.  

Our site rental business is generally characterized by a stable cash flow stream generated by revenues under long-term contracts that should be recurring for the foreseeable future. Over the last five years, our cash flows from operations have been sufficient to fund our cash interest payments and sustaining capital expenditures. We expect our cash flows from operations over the next 12 months will be sufficient to cover our debt service obligations (principal payments and cash interest) and our sustaining capital expenditures (discussed further below), including maintenance activities on our towers. We expect to fund the previously mentioned discretionary investments with cash on hand, operating cash flows, borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility and potential future debt financings. In the case of funding acquisitions, we also may utilize issuances of our common stock. In addition, we expect to continue to increase our debt in nominal dollars if we realize anticipated future growth in our operating cash flows in order to maintain debt leverage that we believe is appropriately leveraged to drive long-term shareholder value.  

With respect to future debt financings, we plan to continue to utilize a combination of bank debt and securitized notes with a similar structure to our existing tower revenue notes and mortgage loans. The amount of future debt financing is influenced by such factors as (1) our belief in the potential long-term return of our previously mentioned discretionary investments, (2) self imposed limits such as our targeted leverage ratio of generally six to eight times Adjusted EBITDA and interest coverage ratio of generally two times Adjusted EBITDA, (3) our restrictive debt covenants, discussed further below, and (4) the availability of financing at attractive rates, particularly in light of the current crisis in the credit markets (see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7. MD&ALiquidity and Capital ResourcesFactors Affecting Sources of Liquidity).

2007 Highlights and Recent Developments. During 2007, we took certain actions in furtherance of our strategy of seeking long-term growth in our results of operations on a per share basis, including the Global Signal Merger and opportunistic purchases of our common stock. These purchases of our common stock and other actions taken to reduce our actual and potential shares of common stock outstanding have a short-term dilutive impact on our results due to the increased interest expense on the related additional borrowings. However, we believe these actions will drive long-term shareholder value and better position us to translate potential future growth in our site rental business into growth of our operating results on a per share basis. Our 2007 significant investing and financing activities are discussed further below and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.  

We completed the Global Signal Merger on January 12, 2007 in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $4.0 billion exclusive of the debt that remained outstanding as obligations of Global Signal we acquired. As a result of the Global Signal Merger, we issued approximately 98.1 million shares of common stock and paid the maximum GS $550M Consideration. The $1.8 billion of mortgage loans have a structure similar to our tower revenue notes and are securitized by the cash flows of a majority of the Global Signal towers. Our decision to fund a portion of the Global Signal Merger in cash was in lieu of our issuing approximately 16.0 million additional shares of our common stock. We utilized cash from the issuance of our tower revenue notes in 2006 to fund the GS $550M Consideration. See Item 7. MD&AGeneral OverviewAcquisition of Global Signal and Item 7. MD&ALiquidity and Capital ResourcesFinancing Activities.  

During 2007, we purchased 21.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $729.8 million in cash (or an average price of $34.68 per share). The cash to fund the common stock purchases was predominately from borrowings under our term loans and revolving credit facility. Consistent with our previously mentioned strategy to allocate capital efficiently, we expect to continue to opportunistically purchase our common stock from time to time.  

Liquidity Position. As of December 31, 2007, after giving effect to our $75.0 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our purchase of 1.1 million shares of common stock in January 2008, we had consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $108.2 million (exclusive of restricted cash of $170.6 million), consolidated long-term and short-term debt of $6.1 billion, consolidated redeemable preferred stock of $313.8 million and consolidated stockholders equity of $3.1 billion. As of February 19, 2008, we also have $100.0 million of availability under our revolving credit facility maturing in January 2009.  

As of December 31, 2007, our outstanding debt has a weighted-average interest rate of 5.4% and predominately consists of $5.3 billion of tower revenue notes and mortgage notes that are securitized by the cash flows from the vast majority of our CCUSA towers, as well as $645.1 million of term loans due in 2014. If our tower revenue notes are not repaid in full by their anticipated repayment dates (five years from original issuance) then our interest rates substantially increase (by at least an additional 5% per annum) and monthly principal payments commence. We anticipate refinancing the tower revenue notes and mortgage loans with new debt similar to our existing tower revenue notes on or before their repayment dates occurring between December 2009 and November 2011, respectively. Our mortgage loans have contractual maturities in December 2009 and February 2011. Our ability to obtain borrowings that are securitized by tower cash flows and are at commercially reasonable terms will depend on various factors such as, our ability to generate cash flows on our existing towers and the state of the capital markets. See Item 7. MD&ALiquidity and Capital ResourcesFactors Affecting Sources of Liquidity Our debt and redeemable preferred stock is discussed further in notes 7 and 10 to our consolidated financial statements.

Operating Activities  

The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for 2007 of $74.6 million from 2006 was due primarily to the cash flow generated by the towers acquired in connection with the Global Signal Merger and the growth in our core site rental business. The increase for 2007 was offset by an increase in cash interest paid of $179.1 million, payments for merger-related fees incurred by Global Signal of approximately $16.3 million, prepayments of long-term easements for land under our towers of $14.9 million and integration costs related to the Global Signal Merger of $24.3 million. We expect net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 will be greater than 2007, primarily as a result of anticipated growth in our core site rental business. Changes in working capital, and particularly changes in deferred rental revenues, prepaid ground leases and accrued interest, can have a dramatic impact on our net cash from operating activities for interim periods, largely due to the timing of payments.  

Investing Activities  

Capital Expenditures. Our capital expenditures can be generally categorized as sustaining or discretionary. Sustaining capital expenditures include capitalized costs related to (1) maintenance activities on our towers, (2) vehicles, (3) information technology equipment, and (4) office equipment. Discretionary capital expenditures, which we commonly also refer to as revenue generating capital expenditures, include (1) purchases of land under towers, (2) tower improvements in order to support additional site rentals, (3) the construction or purchase of towers, and (4) the construction of distributed antenna systems. In general, other than sustaining capital expenditures, our decisions regarding capital expenditures are discretionary and are made with respect to activities we believe exhibit sufficient potential to improve our long-term results of operations on a per share basis. Such decisions are influenced by the availability of capital and expected returns on alternative investments.  

A summary of our capital expenditures for 2006 and 2007 is as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total capital expenditures for 2007 increased by $175.2 million, or 140%, from 2006, predominately related to CCUSA. The increase in sustaining capital expenditures from 2006 to 2007 was primarily related to the towers acquired in connection with the Global Signal Merger. The increase in land purchases related to our ongoing efforts to purchase the land under our towers. During 2006 and 2007, we built or purchased 13 and 188 towers, respectively, exclusive of the Global Signal Merger and the acquisition of Mountain Union. See also Item 7. MD&AResults of OperationsComparison of Operating Segment for a discussion regarding Modeo.  

Consistent with our plan to continue to invest our available cash on hand, anticipated cash flows from operations and cash flows from borrowings in discretionary investments, we expect total capital expenditures for 2008 will be equal to, or modestly greater than, 2007 (primarily as a result of anticipated increases in purchases of land under towers and new tower construction). The amount of capital expenditures related to purchases of towers can vary from period to period; as such, an increase in tower purchases may further increase our 2008 capital expenditures. We expect that most if not all of our capital expenditures for 2008 will be funded from cash flows from operations.  

Acquisition of Global Signal. See Item 7. MD&AGeneral OverviewAcquisition of Global Signal and Item 7. MD&ALiquidity and Capital ResourcesOverview.  

Mountain Union. On January 2, 2007, we purchased the remaining approximately 2% minority interest in Mountain Union for $4.4 million. See note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.

Financing Activities  

Consistent with our strategy to allocate our capital to drive shareholder value, our financing activities for 2006 and 2007 are largely related to purchases of our common stock and additional borrowings. The additional borrowings were used to (1) fund our purchases of common stock, (2) fund the GS $550M Consideration of the Global Signal Merger, and (3) refinance our debt at attractive rates. The net cash provided by (used for) financing activities in 2007 is exclusive of the approximately $1.8 billion of debt that remained outstanding as obligations after the Global Signal Merger consisting of two mortgage loans (see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements). The following is a summary of the significant financing transactions we completed in 2007 and the beginning of 2008.  

2007 Credit Agreement. In January 2007, CCOC entered into a credit agreement that provided a $250.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. In January 2008, we extended the maturity of the revolving credit facility until January 2009. This one-year extension did not result in any other changes to the revolving credit facility including to our credit spreads. We currently have $150.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Availability of the revolving credit facility at any time will be determined by certain financial ratios. We may use the availability under the revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes, which may include financing of capital expenditures, acquisitions, and purchases of our common or preferred stock. The revolving credit facility bears interest at prime rate or LIBOR plus a credit spread based on our consolidated leverage ratio. As of February 19, 2008, the revolving credit facility bears interest at 6.0% (including the credit spread).  

In January and March 2007, CCOC entered into two term loans for an aggregate original principal amount of $650.0 million, which were issued under the credit agreement and are due in 2014. Our purchases of 21.0 million shares of our common stock during 2007 were primarily funded with proceeds from the term loans and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Through the use of interest rate swaps we have fixed the interest rate on the vast majority of the term loans at a rate of 5.6% (including the credit spread) through December 31, 2009.  

The revolving credit facility and the term loans are guaranteed by CCIC and certain of its existing and future subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of certain equity interests of certain existing and future subsidiaries of CCIC, as well as a security interest in CCOCs deposit accounts and securities accounts. For a further discussion of the revolving credit facility and the term loans, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Common Stock Activity. A summary of common stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007 is as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2006 and 2007, we purchased 15.9 million and 21.0 million shares of our common stock, respectively. We utilized $518.0 million and $729.8 million in cash, respectively, to affect these purchases and paid an average price per share of $32.64 and $34.68, respectively. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. See Item 7. MD&AGeneral OverviewAcquisition of Global Signal for a discussion of common stock issued in the Global Signal Merger. In addition, in January 2008, we purchased 1.1 million shares of common stock utilizing $42.0 million (average price of $36.99 per share) in cash.

CCAL Capital Return. See Item 7. MD&AResults of OperationsComparison of Operating Segments for a discussion of the minority interest and CCAL capital return.  

Preferred Stock Dividends. We have the option to pay dividends on our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock in cash or shares of common stock (valued at 95% of the current market value of the common stock, as defined) (see Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities). We are required to redeem all outstanding shares of our 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock on August 15, 2012 at a price equal to the liquidation preference plus accumulated and unpaid dividends. The shares of 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock are convertible, at the option of the holder, in whole or in part at any time, into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $36.875 per share of common stock. Under certain circumstances, we generally have the right to convert the 6.25% Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, into 8.6 million shares of common stock at 120% of the conversion price or $44.25.  

Interest Rate Swaps. We have used, and may continue to use when we deem prudent, interest rate swaps to manage and reduce our interest rate risk, including the use of interest rate swaps to hedge the variability in cash flows from changes in LIBOR on anticipated refinancing and outstanding variable rate debt. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of our use of interest rate swaps.  

Restricted Cash. Pursuant to the indenture governing the tower revenue notes and the loan agreements governing the mortgage loans, all rental cash receipts of the issuers of these debt investments and their subsidiaries are restricted and held by an indenture trustee. The restricted cash in excess of required reserve balances is subsequently released to us in accordance with the terms of the indentures. See also notes 1 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements.  

Contractual Cash Obligations  

The following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations, which relate primarily to our outstanding borrowings and ground lease obligations, as of December 31, 2007 after giving effect to our borrowings of $75.0 million in January 2008 under our revolving credit facility and the extension of the maturity to January 2009 from January 2008.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) The tower revenue notes are presented assuming we elect to repay in full on the anticipated repayment dates (five years from original issuance). If the tower revenue notes are not repaid in full by their respective anticipated repayment dates, then our interest rates substantially increase and monthly principal payments commence. See note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.  

 (b) Amounts relate primarily to ground lease obligations for the land on which our towers reside, and are based on the assumption that payments will be made through the end of the period for which we hold renewal rights. See table below summarizing remaining terms to expiration.  

 (c) The dividends on the preferred stock can be paid in cash or stock at our election. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.  

 (d) Reflects the quarterly principal installments of $1.6 million on the term loans issued in 2007 and the remaining outstanding amount due in January 2014. Interest payments on the floating rate debt are based on estimated rates in effect during the first quarter of 2008 exclusive of the impact of our interest rate swaps.  

 (e) The following items are in addition to the obligations disclosed in the above table:  

       We currently have $100.0 million of availability under our revolving credit facility.  

       We have a legal obligation to perform certain asset retirement activities, including requirements upon lease termination to remove towers or remediate the land upon which our towers reside. The cash obligations disclosed in the above table, as of December 31, 2007, are exclusive of estimated undiscounted future cash outlays for asset retirement obligations of nearly $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2007, the net present value of these asset retirement obligations was approximately $29.2 million.  

       Our interest rate swaps require cash settlement to or from us in the future. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

       We are obligated under letters of credit to various landlords, insurers and other parties in connection with certain contingent retirement obligations under various tower land leases and certain other contractual obligations. The letters of credit were issued through one of CCUSAs lenders in amounts aggregating $12.6 million and expire on various dates through February 2009.

       It is reasonably possible the current IRS examination may be finalized in the next twelve months and could result in a cash payment related to the alternative minimum tax on our unrecognized tax benefits. See note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.  

       We are obligated to pay or reimburse others for property taxes related to our towers. See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements.  

The following table summarizes as of December 31, 2007 the remaining terms to expiration (including renewal terms at our option) of (1) the ground leases, subleases, or licenses for the land on which approximately 18,400 of our towers reside and (2) agreements to manage approximately 700 towers owned by third parties where we had sublease agreements with the tower owner. In addition, we own in fee or have perpetual or long-term easements in the land on which approximately 4,700 of our towers reside (20% of total towers). See Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity  

Holding Companies. As holding companies, CCIC and CCOC will require distributions or dividends from their subsidiaries, or will be forced to use their remaining cash balances, to fund their debt. The terms of the current indebtedness of their subsidiaries allow them to distribute cash to their holding companies unless they experience a deterioration of financial performance.  

Compliance with Debt Covenants. Our debt obligations contain certain financial covenants with which CCIC or our subsidiaries must maintain compliance in order to avoid the imposition of certain restrictions. Various of our debt obligations also place other restrictions on CCIC or our subsidiaries, including the ability to incur debt and liens, purchase our securities, make capital expenditures, dispose of assets, undertake transactions with affiliates, make other investments and pay dividends. See note 7 of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt covenants.  

Factors that are likely to determine our subsidiaries ability to comply with their current and future debt covenants include their (1) financial performance, (2) levels of indebtedness, and (3) debt service requirements. Given the current level of indebtedness of our subsidiaries, the primary risk of a debt covenant violation would be from a deterioration of a subsidiarys financial performance. Should a covenant violation occur in the future as a result of a shortfall in financial performance (or for any other reason), we might be required to make principal payments earlier than currently scheduled and may not have access to additional borrowings under these facilities as long as the covenant violation continues. Any such early principal payments would have to be made from our existing cash balances or cash from operations. If our subsidiaries that issued the tower revenue notes and mortgage loans were to default on the debt, the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the securitized towers, in which case we could lose the towers and the revenues associated with the towers. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with our debt covenants.  

Financial Performance of Our Subsidiaries. A factor affecting our continued generation of cash flows from operating activities is our ability to maintain our existing recurring site rental revenues and to convert those revenues into operating cash flows by efficiently managing our operating costs. Our ability to service (pay principal and cash interest) or refinance our current debt obligations and obtain additional debt will depend on our future financial performance, which, to a certain extent, is subject to various factors that are beyond our control as discussed further herein and in Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Levels of Indebtedness and Debt Service Requirements. Our ability to obtain cash financing in the form of debt instruments, preferred stock or common stock in the capital markets depends on, among other things, general economic conditions, conditions of the wireless industry, wireless carrier consolidation or network sharing, new technologies, our financial performance and the state of the capital markets. We anticipate refinancing the majority, if not all, of our debt and preferred stock within the next five years. There can be no assurances we will be able to effect this anticipated financing on commercially reasonable terms or on terms, including with respect to interest  

36  

Table of Contents 

Index to Financial Statements 

 rates, as favorable as our current debt and preferred stock. If we are unable to refinance or renegotiate our debt, our debt service requirements may significantly increase in the future.  

The current credit crisis has resulted in a widening of credit spreads for us. However, there has recently been a general decrease in interest rates (such as LIBOR) corresponding with the challenges of the credit market. Currently, the negative impact of widening credit spreads has been somewhat mitigated by a general decrease in interest rates. By the end of 2011, we expect to refinance our outstanding indebtedness and have entered into interest rate swaps to manage and reduce our interest rate risk on this anticipated refinancing. Changes in our credit spreads over the intermediate to long-term may impact our interest expense and interest coverage ratios.  

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K.  

Accounting and Reporting Matters  

Related Party Transactions  

In January 2007, we purchased 17.7 million shares of common stock for $600.5 million in cash from certain investment funds affiliated with Fortress Investment Group LLC (collectively, Fortress), (2) Greenhill Capital Partners, L.P. and certain of its related partnerships (collectively, Greenhill), and (3) Abrams Capital Partners II, L.P. and certain of its related partnerships (collectively, Abrams Capital).

The following is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe (1) are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and (2) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The critical accounting policies and estimates for 2007 is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., with no need for managements judgment in their application. In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions.  

Revenue Recognition. Site rental revenues are recognized on a monthly basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the relevant lease or agreement with terms generally ranging from five to ten years. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, these revenues are recognized on a monthly basis, regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts. If the payment terms call for fixed escalations (as in fixed dollar or fixed percentage increases), the effect of such increases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the agreement. When calculating our straight-line rental revenues, we consider all fixed elements of tenant leases escalation provisions, even if such escalation provisions also include a variable element. As a result of recognizing revenue on a straight-line basis, a portion of the revenue in a given period represents cash collected in other periods. For 2005, 2006 and 2007, the non-cash portion of our site rental revenues related to recognizing revenue on a straight-line basis amounted to approximately $16.1 million, $20.5 million and $42.9 million, respectively. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.  

We provide network services, such as antenna installations and subsequent augmentation, network design and site selection, site acquisition services, site development and other services, on a limited basis. Network services revenues are generally recognized under a method which approximates the completed contract method. Under the completed contract method, revenues and costs for a particular project are recognized in total at the completion date. When using the completed contract method of accounting for network services revenues, we must accurately determine the completion date for the project in order to record the revenues and costs in the proper period. For antenna installations, we consider the project complete when the customer can begin transmitting its signal through the antenna. We must also be able to estimate losses on uncompleted contracts, as such losses must be recognized as soon as they are known. The completed contract method is used for projects that require relatively short periods of time to complete (generally less than one year), such as our network services agreements and contracts. We do

 not believe that our use of the completed contract method for network services projects produces financial position and operating results that differ substantially from the percentage-of-completion method.  

Some of our arrangements with our customers call for the performance of multiple revenue-generating activities. Generally, these arrangements include both site rental and network services. In such cases, we determine whether the multiple deliverables are to be accounted for separately or on a combined basis. In order to be accounted for separately, the undelivered items must (1) have stand-alone value to the customer, (2) have reliably determinable fair value on a separate basis, and (3) have delivery which is probable and under our control. In addition, the delivered item must have stand-alone value to the customer. Allocation of recognized revenue in such arrangements is based on the relative fair value of the separately delivered items. We have generally determined that it is appropriate to account for antenna installation activities separately from the customers subsequent site rentals.  

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets. We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Any purchase price in excess of the net fair value of the assets and liabilities assumed is allocated to goodwill. The fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities is determined by (1) using estimates of replacement costs for tangible fixed assets (such as towers) and (2) using discounted cash flow valuation methods for estimating identifiable intangibles (such as site rental contracts and above and below market leases). The purchase price allocation requires subjective estimates that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financials statements including the amount of depreciation, amortization and accretion expense. The determination of the final purchase price allocation could extend over several quarters resulting in the use of preliminary estimates that are subject to adjustment until finalized.  

We are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets for purposes of determining depreciation, amortization and accretion expense that if incorrectly estimated could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Depreciation expense for our property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our various classes of tangible assets. The substantial portion of our property and equipment represents the cost of our towers which is depreciated with an estimated useful life equal to the shorter of 20 years or the term of the lease (including optional renewals) for the land under the tower. The useful life of our intangible assets are estimated based on the period for which the intangible asset will benefit us.  

We review the carrying values of property and equipment, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the sum of the estimated future cash flows (undiscounted) from the asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset. Our determination that an adverse event or change in circumstance has occurred will generally involve (1) a deterioration in an assets financial performance compared to historical results, (2) a shortfall in an assets financial performance compared to forecasted results, or (3) a change in strategy affecting the utility of the asset. Our measurement of the fair value of an impaired asset will generally be based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows.  

We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether adverse events or changes in circumstances have occurred. This annual impairment test involves (1) a step to identify potential impairment at a reporting unit level based on fair values and (2) a step to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. Our measurement of the fair value for goodwill is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit. The most important estimates for such calculations are the expected additions of new tenants on our towers, the terminal multiple for our projected cash flows and our weighted-average cost of capital.  

During the fourth quarter of 2007, we performed our annual update of the impairment test for goodwill. The results of this test indicated that goodwill was not impaired at any of our reporting units. Future declines in our site rental business could result in an impairment of goodwill, property and equipment and intangible assets in the future. If impairment were to occur in the future, the calculations to measure the impairment could result in the write-off of some portion, to substantially all, of our goodwill, property and equipment and intangible assets.  

Deferred Income Taxes. We record deferred income tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheet related to events that impact our financial statements and tax returns in different periods. In order to compute these deferred tax balances, we first analyze the differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities (referred to as temporary differences). These temporary differences are then multiplied by current tax rates to

 arrive at the balances for the deferred income tax assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized.  

The change in our net deferred income tax balances during a period generally results in a deferred income tax provision or benefit in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). If our expectations about the future tax consequences of past events should prove to be inaccurate, the balances of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities could require significant adjustments in future periods. Such adjustments could cause a material effect on our results of operations for the period of the adjustment. See note 8 to our consolidated financial statements.  

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Standards  

In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. We adopted FIN 48 on January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 resulted in a decrease in accumulated deficit and a decrease in contingent tax liabilities through a cumulative effect adjustment of $4.7 million. See note 8 of our consolidated financial statements.  

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157 (SFAS 157), Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. The FASB amended SFAS 157 to exclude leases accounted for pursuant to SFAS 13. SFAS 157 will be applied prospectively and is effective for us on January 1, 2008, with the exception of a one-year deferral of implementation for certain non-financial assets and liabilities. We believe the impact of the adoption of SFAS 157 will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160 (SFAS 160), Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan Amendment to Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51. SFAS 160 amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS 160 clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 160 requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest. The provisions of SFAS 160 are effective for us as of January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 160 on our consolidated financial statements.  

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141(R) (SFAS 141(R)), Business Combinations (revised 2007). SFAS 141(R) replaces Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (SFAS 141), Business Combinations. SFAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquisition, at their fair value as of the acquisition date. SFAS 141(R) will change the accounting treatment of certain items, including (1) acquisition and restructuring costs will be generally expensed as incurred, (2) noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date (3) acquired contingent liabilities will be recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and subsequently measured at either the higher of such amount or the amount determined under existing guidance for non-acquired contingencies, and (4) changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date will affect provision for income taxes. The provisions of SFAS 141(R) are applied prospectively to our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS 141(R) on our consolidated financial statements.  

See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently issued accounting standards and the related impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

Our measurement of profit or loss currently used to evaluate the operating performance of our operating segments is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted, or Adjusted EBITDA. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA is set forth in Item 7. MD&AResults of OperationsComparison of Operating Segments. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the tower sector and as used in the historical financial statements of Global

 Signal, and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss, net income or loss, cash flows provided by (used for) operating, investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP.  

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because:  

       it is the primary measure used by our management to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations, including the efficiency of our employees and the profitability associated with their performance, the realization of contract revenue under our long-term contracts, our ability to obtain and maintain our customers and our ability to operate our site rental business effectively;  

       it is the primary measure of profit and loss used by management for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operating segments;  

       it is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations;  

       although specific definitions may vary, it is widely used in the wireless tower sector to measure operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion, which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets; and  

       we believe it helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our operating results.  

Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA:  

       with respect to compliance with our debt covenants, which require us to maintain certain financial ratios including, or similar to, Adjusted EBITDA;  

       as the primary measure of profit and loss for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operating segments;  

       as a measurement of operating performance because it assists us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our operating results;  

       in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of operating performance used by management;  

       for planning purposes, including preparation of our annual operating budget;  

       as a valuation measure in strategic analyses in connection with the purchase and sale of assets; and  

       in determining self-imposed limits on our debt levels, including the evaluation of our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio.  

There are material limitations to using a measure such as Adjusted EBITDA, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income or loss. Management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income (loss).
