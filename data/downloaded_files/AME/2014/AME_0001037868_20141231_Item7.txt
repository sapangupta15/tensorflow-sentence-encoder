Business Overview  

AMETEKs operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the Companys strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. In 2014, the Company established records for orders, sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. Contributions from recent acquisitions, combined with successful Operational Excellence initiatives, had a positive impact on 2014 results. The Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEKs four key strategies: Operational Excellence, Strategic Acquisitions, Global & Market Expansion and New Products. Highlights of 2014 were:  

       In 2014, net sales were $4,022.0 million, an increase of $427.9 million or 11.9% from 2013, on contributions from the 2013 and 2014 acquisitions and internal growth of approximately 4% in the Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) and 2% in the Electromechanical Group (EMG) excluding the effect of foreign currency translation.  

       Net income for 2014 was $584.5 million, an increase of $67.5 million or 13.1%, compared with $517.0 million in 2013.  

       During 2014, the Company spent $573.6 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to acquire five businesses:  

       In January 2014, the Company acquired Teseq Group, a leading manufacturer of test and measurement instrumentation for electromagnetic compatibility testing;  

       In February 2014, the Company acquired VTI Instruments (VTI), a manufacturer of high precision test and measurement instrumentation;  

       In May 2014, the Company acquired Luphos GmbH. Luphos core technology is used in the measurement of complex aspheric optical surfaces and other surfaces through non-contact methods;  

       In June 2014, the Company acquired Zygo Corporation, a provider of optical metrology solutions, high-precision optics and optical assemblies used in a wide range of scientific, industrial and medical applications; and  

       In August 2014, the Company acquired Amptek, Inc., a manufacturer of instruments and detectors used to identify composition of materials using x-ray fluorescence technology.  

       Higher earnings resulted in record cash flow provided by operating activities that totaled $726.0 million for 2014, a $65.3 million or 9.9% increase from 2013.

       The Company continues to maintain a strong international sales presence. International sales, including U.S. export sales, were $2,196.2 million or 54.6% of net sales in 2014, compared with $1,984.5 million or 55.2% of net sales in 2013.  

       New orders for 2014 were a record at $4,079.3 million, an increase of $457.4 million or 12.6%, compared with $3,621.9 million in 2013. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2014 was $1,197.3 million.  

       The Company continued its emphasis on investment in research, development and engineering, spending $208.3 million in 2014 before customer reimbursement of $8.9 million. Sales from products introduced in the past three years were $921.0 million or 22.9% of net sales.  

       In the third quarter of 2014, AMETEK completed a private placement agreement to sell $700 million in senior notes to a group of institutional investors. There are three funding dates for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September 2014 for $500 million, consisting of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.73% senior notes due September 2024, $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.83% senior notes due September 2026 and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.98% senior notes due September 2029. The second funding date will be in June 2015 for $50 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.91% senior notes due June 2025. The third funding date will be in August 2015 for $150 million, consisting of $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.96% senior notes due August 2025 and $50 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.45% senior notes due August 2035. The senior notes will carry a weighted average interest rate of 3.88%. The proceeds from the first funding of the senior notes were used to pay down all domestic borrowings under AMETEKs revolving credit facility.

Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with the year ended December 31, 2013  

In 2014, the Company established records for orders, sales, operating income, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these results from contributions from the acquisitions completed in 2014 and the acquisitions of Powervar, Inc. in December 2013, Creaform, Inc. in October 2013 and Controls Southeast (CSI) in August 2013, internal sales growth in both EIG and EMG, as well as our Operational Excellence initiatives. The full year impact of the 2014 acquisitions and our continued focus on and implementation of Operational Excellence initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on our 2015 results while a stronger U.S. dollar is expected to be a headwind in 2015.  

Net sales for 2014 were $4,022.0 million, an increase of $427.9 million or 11.9%, compared with net sales of $3,594.1 million in 2013. EIG net sales were $2,421.6 million in 2014, an increase of 19.0% from $2,034.6 million in 2013. EMG net sales were $1,600.3 million in 2014, an increase of 2.6% from $1,559.5 million in 2013. The increase in net sales for 2014 was attributable to higher order rates which drove internal sales growth of approximately 3% and acquisition growth of 9%.  

Total international sales for 2014 were $2,196.2 million or 54.6% of net sales, an increase of $211.7 million or 10.7%, compared with international sales of $1,984.5 million or 55.2% of net sales in 2013. The $211.7 million increase in international sales resulted from the acquisitions mentioned above and higher sales growth, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $1,148.1 million in 2014, an increase of $111.1 million or 10.7%, compared with $1,037.0 million in 2013. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from the 2014 and 2013 acquisitions noted above, excluding Teseq and Creaform.  

New orders for 2014 were a record at $4,079.3 million, an increase of $457.4 million or 12.6%, compared with $3,621.9 million in 2013. The increase in orders for 2014 was due to internal order growth of approximately 4%, acquisitions added 10% and foreign currency translation was an unfavorable 1% effect. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2014 was $1,197.3 million, an increase of $57.3 million or 5.0%, compared with $1,140.0 million at December 31, 2013.  

Segment operating income for 2014 was $948.0 million, an increase of $86.5 million or 10.0%, compared with segment operating income of $861.5 million in 2013. The increase in segment operating income resulted primarily from the acquisitions and internal sales growth mentioned above, as well as the benefits of the Companys Operational Excellence initiatives, partially offset by $18.9 million in Zygo integration costs, comprised of $10.4 million in severance charges, a $4.5 million fair value inventory adjustment and $4.0 million in other charges, related to the Zygo acquisition. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 23.6% in 2014, compared with 24.0% in 2013. The decrease in segment operating margins resulted primarily from the Zygo integration costs noted above, partially offset by the benefits of the Companys Operational Excellence initiatives.  

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for 2014 were $462.6 million, an increase of $64.4 million or 16.2%, compared with $398.2 million in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.5% for 2014, compared with 11.1% in 2013. Selling expenses for 2014 were $413.8 million, an increase of $61.6 million or 17.5%, compared with $352.2 million in 2013. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 10.3% for 2014, compared with 9.8% in 2013. The selling expenses increase and the corresponding increase in selling expenses as a percentage of sales were due primarily to business acquisitions. The Companys acquisition strategy generally is to acquire differentiated businesses, which, because of their distribution channels and higher marketing costs, tend to have a higher rate of selling expenses. Base business selling expenses increased approximately 4% for 2014 compared to 2013, which was in line with internal sales growth.  

Corporate administrative expenses for 2014 were $48.8 million, an increase of $2.8 million or 6.1%, compared with $46.0 million in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.2% for 2014, compared with 1.3% in 2013.

Consolidated operating income was $898.6 million or 22.3% of net sales for 2014, an increase of $83.5 million or 10.2%, compared with $815.1 million or 22.7% of net sales in 2013.  

Interest expense was $79.9 million for 2014, an increase of $6.3 million or 8.6%, compared with $73.6 million in 2013. The increase was due to the impact of the initial funding of the private placement senior notes in the third quarter of 2014 and higher borrowings under the revolving credit facility to help fund the recent acquisitions.  

Other expenses, net were $13.8 million for 2014, a decrease of $2.9 million, compared with $16.7 million in 2013. The decrease was driven by an $8.0 million insurance policy gain in the fourth quarter of 2014, partially offset by a $5.5 million reversal of an insurance policy receivable related to a specific uncertain tax position liability of an acquired entity in the third quarter of 2014.  

The effective tax rate for 2014 was 27.4%, compared with 28.7% in 2013. Both years effective tax rate reflect the improving mix of foreign earnings subject to tax at lower rates and a continued trend in lower state tax rates. The 2014 effective tax rate reflects a release of $12.9 million of uncertain tax position liabilities related to an acquired entity due to the final closure of a tax year and foreign tax credit benefit on amounts repatriated during the year. On a comparative basis, the 2013 effective tax rate reflected the retroactive extension of the U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credit. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  

Net income for 2014 was $584.5 million, an increase of $67.5 million or 13.1%, compared with $517.0 million in 2013. Diluted earnings per share for 2014 were $2.37, an increase of $0.27 or 12.9%, compared with $2.10 per diluted share in 2013.  

Segment Results  

EIGs net sales totaled $2,421.6 million for 2014, an increase of $387.0 million or 19.0%, compared with $2,034.6 million in 2013. The net sales increase included internal sales growth of approximately 4%, primarily driven by increases in EIGs process instruments businesses, and the 2014 acquisitions and 2013 acquisitions of Powervar and Creaform added 15%.  

EIGs operating income was $613.0 million for 2014, an increase of $60.9 million or 11.0%, compared with $552.1 million in 2013. EIGs increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales mentioned above, partially offset by the Zygo integration costs noted above. EIGs operating margins were 25.3% of net sales for 2014, compared with 27.1% of net sales in 2013. EIGs decrease in operating margins resulted primarily from the Zygo integration costs noted above, partially offset by the benefits of the Groups Operational Excellence initiatives. EIGs 2013 operating margins included a $11.6 million gain on the sale of a facility recorded in third quarter, which was partially offset by incremental growth investments in the businesses recorded in the third and fourth quarters.  

EMGs net sales totaled $1,600.3 million for 2014, an increase of $40.8 million or 2.6%, compared with $1,559.5 million in 2013. The net sales increase was attributable to internal sales growth, driven by increases in EMGs differentiated businesses.  

EMGs operating income was $335.0 million for 2014, an increase of $25.6 million or 8.3%, compared with $309.4 million in 2013. EMGs operating margins were 20.9% of net sales for 2014, compared with 19.8% of net sales in 2013. EMGs increase in operating income and operating margins was driven by the stronger performance in its differentiated businesses, which have higher operating margins than the Groups floor care and specialty motors businesses.

The increase in net sales was attributable to higher order rates, as well as the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The net sales increase for 2013 included internal sales growth of approximately 2%. Foreign currency translation was flat period over period.  

Total international sales for 2013 were $1,984.5 million or 55.2% of net sales, an increase of $276.9 million or 16.2%, compared with international sales of $1,707.6 million or 51.2% of net sales in 2012. The $276.9 million increase in international sales resulted from the acquisitions mentioned above, primarily driven by Dunkermotoren and Micro-Poise, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $1,037.0 million in 2013, an increase of $174.4 million or 20.2%, compared with $862.6 million in 2012. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from the 2013 and 2012 acquisitions noted above, excluding Creaform and Dunkermotoren.  

New orders for 2013 were a record at $3,621.9 million, an increase of $86.8 million or 2.5%, compared with $3,535.1 million in 2012. The increase in orders was primarily attributable to 2013 and 2012 acquisitions. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2013 was $1,140.0 million, an increase of $27.7 million or 2.5%, compared with $1,112.3 million at December 31, 2012.  

Segment operating income for 2013 was $861.5 million, an increase of $72.2 million or 9.1%, compared with segment operating income of $789.3 million in 2012. The increase in segment operating income resulted primarily from the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as the benefits of the Companys lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 24.0% in 2013, compared with 23.7% in 2012. The increase in segment operating margins resulted primarily from the benefits of the Companys lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.  

SG&A expenses for 2013 were $398.2 million, an increase of $17.7 million or 4.7%, compared with $380.5 million in 2012. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.1% for 2013, compared with 11.4% in 2012. Selling expenses increased $14.8 million or 4.4% for 2013 primarily driven by the increase in net sales noted above. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 9.8% for 2013, compared with 10.1% in 2012. Base business selling expenses decreased approximately 2% for 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to cost containment initiatives.  

Corporate administrative expenses for 2013 were $46.0 million, an increase of $2.9 million or 6.7%, compared with $43.1 million in 2012. The increase in corporate administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher consulting and professional fees. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.3% for both 2013 and 2012.  

Consolidated operating income was $815.1 million or 22.7% of net sales for 2013, an increase of $69.2 million or 9.3%, compared with $745.9 million or 22.4% of net sales in 2012.

Table of Contents 

Interest expense was $73.6 million for 2013, a decrease of $1.9 million or 2.5%, compared with $75.5 million in 2012. The decrease was due to lower borrowings under revolving credit facilities.  

Other expenses, net were $16.7 million for 2013, an increase of $8.8 million, compared with $7.9 million in 2012. The increase was primarily driven by acquisition-related expenses and professional fees, and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency in 2013.  

The effective tax rate for 2013 was 28.7%, compared with 30.7% in 2012. The effective tax rate for 2013 reflects the higher proportion of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, as well as an improved state effective tax rate that reflects the ongoing benefit of favorable planning initiatives. In addition, the retroactive extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit for calendar year 2012 was enacted on January 2, 2013, resulting in an incremental R&D tax credit in 2013. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  

Net income for 2013 was $517.0 million, an increase of $57.9 million or 12.6%, compared with $459.1 million in 2012. Diluted earnings per share for 2013 were $2.10, an increase of $0.22 or 11.7%, compared with $1.88 per diluted share in 2012.

EIGs operating income was $552.1 million for 2013, an increase of $55.0 million or 11.1%, compared with $497.1 million in 2012. EIGs increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales mentioned above. EIGs operating margins were 27.1% of net sales for 2013, compared with 26.5% of net sales in 2012. EIGs increase in operating margins was primarily due to the Groups lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives. EIGs 2013 operating margins included a $11.6 million gain on the sale of a facility recorded in third quarter, which was partially offset by incremental growth investments in the businesses recorded in the third and fourth quarters.  

EMGs net sales totaled $1,559.5 million for 2013, an increase of $97.8 million or 6.7%, compared with $1,461.7 million in 2012. The net sales increase was driven by the acquisition of Dunkermotoren.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $726.0 million in 2014, an increase of $65.3 million or 9.9%, compared with $660.7 million in 2013. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $67.5 million increase in net income, the $19.9 million increase in depreciation and amortization, the $19.2 million increase in deferred income taxes and the $10.7 million decrease in gain on sale of facilities, partially offset by higher overall operating working capital levels necessary to grow the Companys businesses. Free cash flow (cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) was $654.6 million in 2014, compared with $597.4 million in 2013. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $1,022.6 million in 2014, compared with $916.3 million in 2013. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that they are measures used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the Notes to Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).  

Cash used for investing activities totaled $641.6 million in 2014, compared with $460.3 million in 2013. In 2014, the Company paid $573.6 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire Teseq in January 2014, VTI in February 2014, Luphos in May 2014, Zygo in June 2014 and Amptek in August 2014. In 2013, the Company paid $414.3 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire CSI in August 2013, Creaform in October 2013 and Powervar in December 2013.

Additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $71.3 million in 2014, compared with $63.3 million in 2013.  

Cash provided by financing activities totaled $24.1 million in 2014, compared with $70.3 million of cash used for financing activities in 2013. The change in financing cash flow was primarily the result of a net total borrowings increase of $326.6 million in 2014 to partially fund the 2014 acquisitions, compared with a net total borrowings decrease of $44.9 million in 2013. In 2014, short-term borrowings decreased $172.5 million, compared with a decrease of $45.2 million in 2013. In 2014, long-term borrowings increased $499.1 million, compared with an increase of $0.3 million in 2013.  

In 2014, the Company repurchased approximately 4,755,000 shares of its common stock for $245.3 million, compared with $8.5 million used to repurchase approximately 206,000 shares of the Companys common stock in 2013.

Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options were $17.8 million in 2014, compared with $26.1 million in 2013.  

In the third quarter of 2014, the Company completed a private placement agreement to sell $700 million in senior notes to a group of institutional investors. There are three funding dates for the senior notes. The first funding occurred in September 2014 for $500 million, consisting of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.73% senior notes due September 2024, $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.83% senior notes due September 2026 and $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.98% senior notes due September 2029. The second funding date will be in June 2015 for $50 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.91% senior notes due June 2025. The third funding date will be in August 2015 for $150 million, consisting of $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.96% senior notes due August 2025 and $50 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.45% senior notes due August 2035. The senior notes will carry a weighted average interest rate of 3.88%. The senior notes are subject to certain customary covenants, including financial covenants that, among  

28

 other things, require the Company to maintain certain debt to EBITDA and interest coverage ratios. The proceeds from the first funding of the senior notes were used to pay down all domestic borrowings under the Companys revolving credit facility.  

The Company has a revolving credit facility with a total borrowing capacity of $700 million, which excludes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $200 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain conditions. The revolving credit facility expires in December 2018. Interest rates on outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility are at the applicable benchmark rate plus a negotiated spread or at the U.S. prime rate. The revolving credit facility provides the Company with additional financial flexibility to support its growth plans, including its successful acquisition strategy. At December 31, 2014, the Company had available borrowing capacity of $771.2 million under its revolving credit facility, including the $200 million accordion feature.  

At December 31, 2014, total debt outstanding was $1,714.0 million, compared with $1,415.1 million at December 31, 2013, with no significant maturities until the third quarter of 2015 of $150.8 million. The debt-to-capital ratio was 34.6% at December 31, 2014, compared with 31.1% at December 31, 2013. The net debt-to-capital ratio (total debt less cash and cash equivalents divided by the sum of net debt and stockholders equity) was 29.2% at December 31, 2014, compared with 26.3% at December 31, 2013. The net debt-to-capital ratio is presented because the Company is aware that this measure is used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the Notes to Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).  

As a result of all of the Companys cash flow activities in 2014, cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 totaled $377.6 million, compared with $295.2 million at December 31, 2013. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $352.8 million in cash outside the United States, compared with $291.4 million at December 31, 2013. The Company utilizes this cash to fund its international operations, as well as to acquire international businesses. In January 2014, the Company acquired a Swiss company, Teseq Group, for approximately 78 million Swiss francs (approximately $87 million). The Company is in compliance with all covenants, including financial covenants, for all of its debt agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities and access to long-term capital funds to enable it to meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future.  

Subsequent Event  

In January 2015, the Company contributed $50.0 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans.

The following table summarizes AMETEKs contractual cash obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flows in future years at December 31, 2014.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  The liability for uncertain tax positions was not included in the table of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 because the timing of the settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  

 (2)  Includes the $450 million private placement completed in 2007, the $350 million private placement completed in 2008 and the $500 million private placement completed in 2014.  

 (3)  Although not contractually obligated, the Company expects to have the capability to repay the revolving credit loan within one year as permitted in the credit agreement. Accordingly, $88.1 million was classified as short-term debt at December 31, 2014.  

 (4)  Represents a capital lease for a building and land associated with the Cameca SAS acquisition. The lease has a term of 12 years, which began in July 2006, and is payable quarterly.  

 (5)  The leases expire over a range of years from 2015 to 2082 with renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of the leases.  

 (6)  Purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.  

Other Commitments  

The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of $44.1 million related to performance and payment guarantees at December 31, 2014. Based on experience with these arrangements, the Company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the Companys accounting policies and to Managements Discussion and Analysis. The information that follows  

30  

Table of Contents 

 represents additional specific disclosures about the Companys accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of the Companys significant accounting policies is in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

       Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The Companys policy, with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Companys option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $29.8 million and $28.0 million, respectively. The Companys expense for warranty obligations was $10.5 million, $8.6 million and $10.1 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience, additional accruals may be required.  

       Accounts Receivable. The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on its historical experience. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was $10.4 million and $9.5 million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  

       Inventories. The Company uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of accounting, which approximates current replacement cost, for approximately 80% of its inventories at December 31, 2014. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 20% of its inventory at December 31, 2014. For inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the FIFO value would have been $24.4 million and $23.3 million higher than the LIFO value reported in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives. If these factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required.  

       Business Combinations. The Company allocates the purchase price of an acquired company, including when applicable, the fair value of contingent consideration between tangible assets and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired businesses based on estimated fair values, with any residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. Third party appraisal firms and other consultants are engaged to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Estimating fair values requires significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, including but  

31  

Table of Contents 

     not limited to: discount rates, future cash flows and the economic lives of trade names, technology, customer relationships, property, plant and equipment, as well as income taxes. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are inherently uncertain.  

       Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, the Company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units. The Company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and went directly to performing the first step quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test in the current year. The Company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. The first step in the quantitative process is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The Company would be required to record any such impairment losses.  

The Company identifies its reporting units at the component level, which is one level below our operating units. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting units are composed of the divisions one level below our operating units at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.  

The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the Companys long-range plan. The Companys long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the Companys overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair values of each reporting unit. The 2014 results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) showed that, despite the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value, the fair values of the Companys reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 16% to 600% for each of the Companys reporting units.  

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets. The Company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen. The Company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. The  

32  

Table of Contents 

 Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.  

The Companys acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2014, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $3,111.5 million or 48.5% of the Companys total assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2014 and determined that the Companys goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.  

Other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets. Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.  

       Pensions. The Company has U.S. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The most significant elements in determining the Companys pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2014, the Company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. The discount rate used in determining the 2014 pension cost was 5.0% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 4.38% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2014 and determining the 2015 defined benefit pension cost was 4.2% for U.S. plans and 3.44% for foreign plans. In estimating the U.S. and foreign discount rates, the Companys actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2014 of 7.75% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 6.93% for foreign plans. In 2015, the Company will use 7.75% for the U.S. plans and 6.92% for the foreign plans. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income and equity investments, and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in determining the 2014 pension income for the U.S. plans was 3.75% and was 2.92% for the foreign plans. The U.S. rate of compensation increase will remain unchanged in 2015. The foreign plans rates of compensation increase will decrease slightly to 2.88% in 2015. In 2014, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension income of $10.7 million from its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans, compared with pre-tax pension expense of $0.8 million recognized for these plans in 2013. The Company estimates its 2015 U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension pre-tax income to be approximately $9.5 million.  

All unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date (the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit plans.  

33  

Table of Contents 

To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2014, which totaled $5.7 million, compared with $5.9 million in 2013. The Company anticipates making approximately $54 million to $57 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2015. The estimated cash contributions range includes a $50.0 million cash contribution to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans in January 2015.  

       Income Taxes. The process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Companys tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Companys tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.  

The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Companys forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the Companys deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.  

The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2013-05, Parents Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity (ASU 2013-05). ASU 2013-05 provides guidance for the treatment of the cumulative translation adjustment when an entity ceases to hold a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. The Company adopted ASU 2013-05 effective January 1, 2014 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11). ASU 2013-11 provides guidance for the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The Company adopted ASU 2013-11 effective January 1, 2014 and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statement presentation.  

34  

Table of Contents 

In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity (ASU 2014-08). ASU 2014-08 revised guidance to only allow disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift (e.g., disposal of a major geographical area, a major line of business, a major equity method investment, or other major parts of an entity) and that have a major effect on a reporting entitys operations and financial results to be reported as discontinued operations. The revised guidance also requires expanded disclosure in the financial statements for discontinued operations as well as for disposals of significant components of an entity that do not qualify for discontinued operations presentation. ASU 2014-08 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-08 to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The objective of ASU 2014-09 is to establish a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity recognizes revenue at the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In applying the new guidance, the Company must (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the contracts performance obligations; and (5) recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 applies to all contracts with customers except those that are within the scope of other topics in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. ASU 2014-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and can be adopted by the Company using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach, with early adoption prohibited. The Company continues to evaluate the impacts and monitor the developments related to ASU 2014-09. The Company has not determined the impact ASU 2014-09 may have on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows nor decided upon the method of adoption.  

Internal Reinvestment  

Capital Expenditures  

Capital expenditures were $71.3 million or 1.8% of net sales in 2014, compared with $63.3 million or 1.8% of net sales in 2013. In 2014, 52% of capital expenditures were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. The Companys 2014 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. Capital expenditures in 2015 are expected to approximate 1.7% of net sales, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.  

Development and Engineering  

The Company is committed to, and has consistently invested in, research, development and engineering activities to design and develop new and improved products. Research, development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $208.3 million, $178.7 million and $154.8 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $8.9 million, $9.2 million and $5.0 million, respectively. These amounts included net Company-funded research and development expenses of $119.3 million, $93.9 million and $84.9 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes.

Environmental Matters  

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. The Company believes these waste products were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time. At December 31, 2014, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 14 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). The Company is identified as a de minimis party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In nine of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the remaining site where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Companys liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.  

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $26.6 million and $21.9 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2014, the Company recorded $8.3 million in reserves, of which $3.6 million was related to a 2014 business acquisition. These reserves relate to the estimated costs to remediate known environmental issues at sites associated with the acquired business. Additionally, the Company spent $3.6 million on environmental matters in 2014. The Companys reserves for environmental liabilities at December 31, 2014 and 2013 include reserves of $11.7 million and $13.3 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (HCC). The Company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2014, the Company had $9.3 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCCs former owners for approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.  

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.  

The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available  

36  

Table of Contents 

 information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.  

Market Risk  

The Companys primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Companys differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole.  

The Companys short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. These financial instruments are more fully described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the Swiss franc. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.  

The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel, titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.  

Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.  

Forward-Looking Information  

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Companys operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Companys actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the Companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.
