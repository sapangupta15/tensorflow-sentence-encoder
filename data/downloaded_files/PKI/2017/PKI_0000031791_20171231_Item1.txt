Our Strategy

Our strategy is to develop and deliver innovative products, services and solutions in high-growth markets that utilize our knowledge and expertise to address customers’ critical needs and drive scientific breakthroughs. To execute on our strategy and accelerate revenue growth, we focus on broadening our offerings through both the acquisition of innovative technology and investment in research and development. Our strategy includes:

•Achieving significant growth in both of our core business segments, Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics, through strategic acquisitions and licensing;

•Accelerating innovation through both internal research and development and third-party collaborations and alliances;

•Strengthening our position within key markets, by expanding our global product and service offerings and maintaining superior product quality;

•Utilizing our share repurchase programs to help drive shareholder value; and

•Attracting, retaining and developing talented and engaged employees.

Recent Developments

As part of our strategy to grow our core businesses, we have recently taken the following actions:

Acquisitions in Fiscal Year 2017:

We completed the acquisition of three businesses in fiscal year 2017 for total consideration of $1.6 billion. The acquired businesses were EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG (“EUROIMMUN”) acquired for total consideration of €1.2 billion, Tulip Diagnostics Private Limited (“Tulip”) acquired for total consideration of $127.3 million, and one other business acquired for total consideration of $14.8 million. We have a potential obligation to pay the former shareholders of Tulip up to INR1.6 billion in additional consideration over a two year period, which is currently equivalent to $25.2 million, and is accounted for as compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements over a two year period and is excluded from the purchase price allocation. We reported the operations of EUROIMMUN and Tulip within the results of our Diagnostics segment and the other acquisition within the results of our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment from the acquisition dates.

Restructuring:

During fiscal year 2017, we recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $8.0 million in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment and $2.9 million in our Diagnostics segment related to a workforce reduction from restructuring activities. Our management approved these plans to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives. We also terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and have recorded charges, to the extent applicable, for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us. We recorded pre-tax charges of $3.6 million, in the Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment and $0.5 million in the Diagnostics segment during fiscal year 2017 as a result of these contract terminations. 

3
This pre-tax restructuring activity has been reported as restructuring and contract termination charges and is included as a component of income from continuing operations. We expect no significant impact on future operating results or cash flows from the restructuring activities executed in fiscal year 2017.

Business Segments and Products

We report our business in two segments: Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics. We realigned our businesses at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to better position us to grow in attractive end markets and expand share with our core product offerings through an improved customer focus, more value-add collaboration and breakthrough innovations.

Marketing

All of our businesses market their products and services primarily through their own specialized sales forces. As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 4,000 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 35 countries and marketing products and services in more than 150 countries. In geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.

Raw Materials, Key Components and Supplies

Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components. See the applicable risk factor in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for an additional description of this risk.

Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to 

9
significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for either of our business segments due to the short lead time required for a majority of our sales. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.

Competition

Due to the range and diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. Our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.

We compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market positions. We expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.

Research and Development

Research and development expenditures were $139.4 million during fiscal year 2017, $124.3 million during fiscal year 2016, and $112.5 million during fiscal year 2015.

We have a broad product base, and we do not expect any single research and development project to have significant costs. To accelerate our growth initiatives, we directed our research and development efforts in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 primarily toward our Diagnostics segment, and the environmental, food, life sciences research and laboratory services markets within our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment. We expect to continue our strong investments in research and development to drive growth during fiscal year 2018, and to continue to emphasize the Diagnostics segment, and the environmental, food, life sciences research and laboratory services markets within our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include those governing uses, emissions and discharges of hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $9.4 million and $9.9 million as of December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, respectively, which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. Our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding 

10
the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.

Employees

As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 11,000 employees in our continuing operations. Several of our subsidiaries are parties to contracts with labor unions and workers’ councils. As of December 31, 2017, we estimate that we employed an aggregate of approximately 1,700 union and workers’ council employees. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.

Financial Information About Business Segments

We have included the expenses for our corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, as well as the activity related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans, as “Corporate” below. We have a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in our calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of our operating segments.

The table below sets forth revenue and operating income (loss) from continuing operations by operating segment for the fiscal years ended:

Financial Information About Geographic Areas

Both of our reporting segments conduct business in, and derive substantial revenue from, various countries outside the United States. During fiscal year 2017, we had $1,420.0 million in sales from our international operations, representing approximately 60% of our total sales. During fiscal year 2017, we derived approximately 70% of our international sales from our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment and approximately 30% of our international sales from our Diagnostics segment. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total sales in the future.

We are exposed to the risks associated with international operations, including exchange rate fluctuations, regional and country-specific political and economic conditions, foreign receivables collection concerns, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, tax risks, staffing and labor law concerns, intellectual property protection risks, and differing regulatory requirements. Additional geographic information is discussed in Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
