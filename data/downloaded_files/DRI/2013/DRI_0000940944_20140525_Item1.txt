ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Introduction

Darden Restaurants, Inc. is the world’s largest company-owned and operated full service restaurant company1, and served over 439 million meals in fiscal 2014. As of May 25, 2014, we operated through subsidiaries 2,207 restaurants in the United States and Canada. In the United States, we operated 2,174 restaurants in all 50 states, including 831 Olive Garden®, 679 Red Lobster®, 464 LongHorn Steakhouse®, 54 The Capital Grille®, 52 Yard House®, 38 Seasons 52®, 37 Bahama Breeze®, 12 Eddie V's Prime Seafood®, four test “synergy restaurants” (which house both a Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurant in the same building) and three Wildfish Seafood Grille® restaurants. In Canada, we operated 33 restaurants, including 27 Red Lobster and six Olive Garden restaurants. Through subsidiaries, we own and operate all of our restaurants in the United States and Canada, except for three restaurants located in Central Florida and three restaurants in California which are owned jointly by us and third parties, and managed by us, seven franchised restaurants in Puerto Rico and one Atlanta, Georgia airport location. Of our 2,207 restaurants in the United States and Canada open on May 25, 2014, 1,060 were located on owned sites and 1,147 were located on leased sites. As of May 25, 2014, we had 52 restaurants operated by independent third parties pursuant to area development and franchise agreements, including 23 Red Lobster restaurants in Japan, seven LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in Puerto Rico (mentioned above), seven Red Lobster restaurants, four Olive Garden restaurants, and one LongHorn Steakhouse restaurant in the Middle East region (two Red Lobster restaurants and one Olive Garden restaurant in United Arab Emirates, one Red Lobster restaurant in Qatar, two Red Lobster restaurants and three Olive Garden restaurants in Kuwait, two Red Lobster restaurants and a LongHorn Steakhouse restaurant in Saudi Arabia), and five Olive Garden restaurants, one Red Lobster restaurant and one The Capital Grille restaurant in Mexico, one Red Lobster restaurant and one Olive Garden restaurant in Brazil and one Olive Garden restaurant in Peru. 

 On May 15, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell Red Lobster and certain other assets and associated liabilities for $2.11 billion in cash and we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, in connection with the anticipated sale of Red Lobster, we closed two restaurants that housed both a Red Lobster and an Olive Garden in the same building ("synergy restaurants"). We have classified the results of operations and impairment charges of the Red Lobster business and the two closed synergy restaurants as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for all periods presented. 

 Darden Restaurants, Inc. is a Florida corporation incorporated in March 1995, and is the parent company of GMRI, Inc., also a Florida corporation. GMRI, Inc. and certain other of our subsidiaries own and operate our restaurants. GMRI, Inc. was originally incorporated in March 1968 as Red Lobster Inns of America, Inc. We were acquired by General Mills, Inc. in 1970 and became a separate publicly held company in 1995 when General Mills distributed all of our outstanding stock to the stockholders of General Mills. Our principal executive offices and restaurant support center are located at 1000 Darden Center Drive, Orlando, Florida 32837, telephone (407) 245-4000. Our corporate website address is www.darden.com. We make our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, and Section 16 reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5, and all amendments to those reports available free of charge on our website the same day as the reports are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information on our website is not deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references to “Darden,” “we,” “our” or “us” include Darden Restaurants, Inc., GMRI, Inc. and our respective subsidiaries.

We have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending the last Sunday in May. Our 2014, 2013 and 2012 fiscal years, which ended May 25, 2014, May 26, 2013 and May 27, 2012, respectively, each had 52 weeks.

The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with the information in our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations incorporated by reference in Item 7 of this Form 10-K and our consolidated financial statements incorporated by reference in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Background

We opened our first restaurant, a Red Lobster seafood restaurant, in Lakeland, Florida in 1968. Red Lobster was founded by William B. Darden, for whom we are named. Red Lobster grew from six restaurants in operation at the end of fiscal 1970 to 706 restaurants in the United States and Canada by the end of fiscal 2014. The number of Red Lobster restaurants open at the end of fiscal 2014 increased by one as compared to the end of fiscal 2013.

Olive Garden is an internally developed brand that offers a variety of authentic Italian foods featuring fresh ingredients and a broad selection of imported Italian wines. In fiscal 1983, Olive Garden opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida. At the end of fiscal 2014, Olive Garden had expanded to 837 restaurants in the United States and Canada. The number of Olive Garden restaurants at the end of fiscal 2014 increased by nine as compared to the end of fiscal 2013.

Bahama Breeze is an internally developed brand that provides a Caribbean escape, offering the food, drinks and atmosphere you would find in the islands. In fiscal 1996, Bahama Breeze opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida. At the end of fiscal 2014, there were 37 Bahama Breeze restaurants in the United States, and the number of restaurants had increased by four as compared to the end of fiscal 2013.

Seasons 52 is an internally developed brand that provides a casually sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar with seasonally inspired menus offering fresh ingredients to create great tasting meals that are lower in calories than comparable restaurant meals. In fiscal 2003, Seasons 52 opened its first restaurant in Orlando, Florida. At the end of fiscal 2014, there were 38 Seasons 52 restaurants in the United States, and the number of restaurants had increased by seven as compared to the end of fiscal 2013.

On October 1, 2007, we completed the acquisition of the common stock of RARE Hospitality International, Inc. (“RARE”). RARE owned and operated two principal restaurant brands, LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille, of which 288 and 29 locations, respectively, were in operation as of the date of the acquisition. LongHorn Steakhouse, with locations primarily in the Eastern half of the United States, is a leader in the full service dining steakhouse category with an atmosphere reminiscent of the American West, and The Capital Grille, with locations in major metropolitan cities in the United States, is a leader in the full service dining premium steakhouse category featuring relaxed and elegant style. At the end of fiscal 2014, there were 464 LongHorn Steakhouse and 54 The Capital Grille restaurants in the United States, and the number of restaurants open had increased by 34 and five, respectively, as compared to the end of fiscal 2013.

In March 2011, we opened a test “synergy restaurant.” At the end of fiscal 2014, we had four synergy restaurants in operation in the United States after having closed two locations during fiscal 2014, which have been included in discontinued operations. In connection with the anticipated Red Lobster sale, the remaining four synergy restaurants will be converted to Olive Garden restaurants by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

On November 14, 2011, we completed the acquisition of eight Eddie V's Prime Seafood restaurants and three Wildfish Seafood Grille restaurants (collectively, "Eddie V's"). Eddie V's is a leading luxury seafood brand providing a sophisticated and contemporary ambiance, with locations in Arizona, California and Texas at the time of the acquisition. The acquired operations are included in our financial statements from the date of the acquisition. At the end of fiscal 2014, there were 15 Eddie V's restaurants in the United States, and the number of restaurants open had increased by three, as compared to the end of fiscal 2013.

 On August 29, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Yard House USA, Inc. (“Yard House”). Yard House, which opened its first restaurant in 1996, offers contemporary American cuisine with chef-inspired recipes and ethnic flavors along with a wide range of draft beers and other beverages in a stylish and energetic setting. At the time of acquisition, Yard House had 40 restaurant locations in 13 states. The acquired operations are included in our financial statements from the date of the acquisition. At the end of fiscal 2014, there were 52 Yard House restaurants in the United States, and the number of restaurants open had increased by eight as compared to the end of fiscal 2013.

Our Specialty Restaurant Group was formed at the time of the RARE acquisition to support the operations of The Capital Grille, Seasons 52 and Bahama Breeze restaurants. Eddie V's and Yard House have joined the Specialty Restaurant Group as well. Our differentiated brands in this group focus on culinary and beverage innovation and exceptional service. 

The following table shows our growth and lists the number of restaurants operated in the United States and Canada by each of our brands for the fiscal years indicated. The table excludes our restaurants operated by independent third parties pursuant to area development and franchise agreements. The table also excludes all Red Lobster restaurants held for sale and other restaurants that are included in discontinued operations. The final column in the table lists our total sales from continuing operations for the fiscal years indicated.

(1)Includes only restaurants included in continuing operations. Excludes other restaurant brands operated by us in these years that are no longer owned by us, and restaurants that were included in discontinued operations. See "Restaurant Brands - Discontinued Operations." 

(2)Includes one test synergy restaurant in 2011, one synergy restaurant in 2012, four synergy restaurants in 2013, and four synergy restaurants in 2014, housing two restaurant brands in the same building. We expect to convert the four remaining synergy restaurants to Olive Garden restaurants by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015. 

Strategy

The restaurant industry is generally considered to be comprised of three segments: quick service, fast casual and full service. Our restaurants are all within the full service segment, which is highly fragmented and includes many independent operators and small chains. We believe that capable operators of strong multi-unit brands have the opportunity to increase their share of the full service segment. We believe we have strong brands, and that the breadth and depth of our experience and expertise sets us apart in the full service restaurant industry. This collective capability is the product of investments over many years in areas that are critical to success in our business, including brand management excellence, restaurant operations excellence, supply chain, talent management and information technology, among other things. 

During fiscal 2015, we are focused on progressing with our value creation priorities, which include: completion of the Red Lobster sale; continuation of the Olive Garden "brand renaissance"; continuation of new restaurant growth at our other brands, primarily driven by LongHorn; implementation of a new management incentive plan that more directly emphasizes same-restaurant sales, free cash flow and relative total shareholder return; continuation of the focus on our restaurant support platform costs; and improvement of capital allocation discipline.

The total sales growth we envision should increase the cost-effectiveness of our restaurant support platform. However, we also plan to supplement our conventional incremental year-to-year cost management efforts with an ongoing focus on identifying and pursuing transformational multi-year cost reduction opportunities.

While we are a leader in the full service dining segment, we know we cannot be successful without a clear sense of who we are. Our business is a people business, and our core purpose is “To nourish and delight everyone we serve.” This core purpose is supported by our core values:

•Integrity and fairness;

•Respect and caring;

•Diversity;

•Always learning/always teaching;

•Being “of service;”

•Teamwork; and

•Excellence.

Our mission is to be “The best, now and for generations... and a place where people can achieve their dreams.” We feel we have a compelling opportunity to create a company that's more valuable and valued - a company that matters. We believe we can achieve this goal by continuing to build on our strategy to be a brand-building company which is focused on:

•Brand relevance;

•Brand support;

•A vibrant business model;

•Competitively superior leadership; and

•A unifying, motivating culture.

On May 15, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell Red Lobster and certain other assets and associated liabilities for $2.11 billion in cash. These assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of May 25, 2014. We have classified the results of operations of the Red Lobster business as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for all periods presented.

Synergy Restaurants

In March 2011, we opened a test “synergy restaurant” that housed both a Red Lobster and Olive Garden restaurant in the same building, but with separate front doors, dining rooms and brand-specific menus. We developed this concept to test expansion into smaller markets that would not meet our population density requirements to build a single brand. We opened a second synergy test location during fiscal 2012 and four locations during fiscal 2013.  In connection with the anticipated sale of Red Lobster, we closed two synergy locations in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014, leaving a total of four locations operating at the end of fiscal 2014. The results of operations and asset impairment charges of the two closed locations are included in discontinued operations. We expect to convert the four remaining restaurants to Olive Garden restaurants by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

Recent and Planned Restaurant Growth 

During fiscal 2014, we opened 70 net new restaurants in the United States and Canada. Our fiscal 2014 actual and fiscal 2015 projected net new openings in the U.S. and Canada from continuing operations by brand are shown below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Excludes restaurants that were included in discontinued operations.

The actual number of openings for each of our brands will depend on many factors, including our ability to locate appropriate sites, negotiate acceptable purchase or lease terms, obtain necessary local governmental permits, complete construction, and recruit and train restaurant management and hourly personnel. Our objective is to continue to expand all of our restaurant brands. 

We consider location to be a critical factor in determining a restaurant’s long-term success, and we devote significant effort to the site selection process. Prior to entering a market, we conduct a thorough study to determine the optimal number and placement of restaurants. Our site selection process incorporates a variety of analytical techniques to evaluate key factors. These factors include trade area demographics, such as target population density and household income levels; competitive influences in the trade area; the site’s visibility, 

6
accessibility and traffic volume; and proximity to activity centers such as shopping malls, hotel/motel complexes, offices and universities. Members of senior management evaluate, inspect and approve each restaurant site prior to its acquisition. Constructing and opening a new restaurant typically takes approximately 180 days on average after permits are obtained and the site is acquired.

The following table illustrates the approximate average capital investment, square footage and dining capacity of the nine Olive Garden restaurants and the 34 LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants (33 new restaurants and one relocation) opened during fiscal 2014. The table excludes any rebuilt restaurants. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Estimated final cost includes net present value of lease obligations and working capital credit, but excludes internal overhead.

(2)Includes all space under the roof, including the coolers and freezers.

(3)Includes bar dining seats and patio seating, but excludes bar stools.

(4)Includes patio dining tables.

We systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards. When a restaurant falls below minimum standards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement marketing and operational plans to improve that restaurant’s performance. If performance does not improve to acceptable levels, the restaurant is evaluated for relocation, closing or conversion to one of our other brands.

During fiscal 2012, we permanently closed one Red Lobster and two LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants. During fiscal 2013, we temporarily closed one LongHorn Steakhouse and permanently closed one Red Lobster restaurant. During fiscal 2014, we permanently closed two synergy restaurants. Permanent closures are typically due to economic changes in trade areas, the expiration of lease agreements, or site concerns. Accordingly, we continue to evaluate our site locations in order to minimize the risk of future closures or asset impairment charges. As of May 25, 2014, there were two temporarily closed Olive Garden restaurants which we expect to reopen during fiscal 2015 and two permanently closed Olive Garden restaurants. 

Restaurant Operations 

We believe that high-quality restaurant management is critical to our long-term success. Our restaurant management structure varies by brand and restaurant size. We issue detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of restaurant operations, as well as food and beverage manuals which detail the preparation procedures of our recipes. The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each restaurant and for ensuring compliance with our operating standards.

Each typical Olive Garden restaurant is led by a general manager, and each LongHorn Steakhouse restaurant is led by a managing partner. Each also has three to five additional managers, depending on the operating complexity and sales volume of the restaurant. In addition, each restaurant typically employs an average of 50 to 120 hourly employees, most of whom work part-time. Restaurant general managers or managing partners report to a director of operations who is responsible for approximately six to ten restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by operations management, including officer level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards. Red Lobster's restaurant management is consistent with that of Olive Garden.

Since the completion of our new operations organizational structure during fiscal year 2013, each director of operations of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse reports to a Regional Vice President. The new Regional Vice President role, which typically supervises six to eight directors of operations, further strengthens our restaurant operations expertise by elevating the execution required to build guest loyalty and enhance our talent development capacity in the field. Four to five Regional Vice Presidents are supervised by a Senior Vice President of Operations which reduces the span of control for our Senior Vice Presidents of Operations. Our new operations organizational structure now allows our Senior Vice President of Operations role to focus on identifying new tools, support and operations strategies required to sustainably grow guest counts and sales in their particular division and better enable talent rotation and sharing across our brands.

Each Bahama Breeze and Yard House restaurant is led by a general manager, and each The Capital Grille, Seasons 52 and Eddie V's restaurant is led by a managing partner. Each also has one to six managers. Each The Capital Grille, Seasons 52 and Eddie V's restaurant has one to three executive chefs, and each Bahama Breeze and Yard House restaurant has one to three culinary managers. In addition, each restaurant typically employs an average of 65 to 150 hourly employees, most of whom work part-time. The general manager or managing partner of each restaurant reports directly to a director of operations, who has operational responsibility for approximately three to ten restaurants. Restaurants are visited regularly by operations management, including officer level executives, to help ensure strict adherence to all aspects of our standards. 

7
Our Learning Center of Excellence in partnership with each brand’s head of training, together with senior operations executives, are responsible for developing and maintaining our operations training programs. These efforts include a 12 to 13-week training program for management trainees (seven to nine weeks in the case of internal promotions) and continuing development programs for managers, supervisors and directors. The emphasis of the training and development programs varies by restaurant brand, but includes leadership, restaurant business management and culinary skills. We also use a highly structured training program to open new restaurants, including deploying training teams experienced in all aspects of restaurant operations. The opening training teams typically begin work one and a half weeks prior to opening and remain at the new restaurant for up to three weeks after the opening. They are re-deployed as appropriate to enable a smooth transition to the restaurant’s operating staff.

We maintain performance measurement and incentive compensation programs for our management-level employees. We believe that our leadership position, strong success-oriented culture and various short-term and long-term incentive programs, including stock and stock-based compensation, help attract and retain highly motivated restaurant managers.

Quality Assurance 

Our Total Quality Department helps ensure that all restaurants provide safe, high-quality food in a clean and safe environment. Through rigorous physical evaluation and testing at our North American laboratories and through “point source inspection” by our international team of quality specialists in several foreign countries, we purchase only seafood that meets or exceeds our specifications. We use independent third parties to inspect and evaluate commodity vendors. In addition, any commodity supplier that produces a “high-risk” product is subject to a food safety evaluation by Darden personnel at least annually. We require our suppliers to maintain sound manufacturing practices and operate with the comprehensive Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (“HACCP”) food safety programs adopted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The HACCP programs focus on preventing hazards that could cause food-borne illnesses by applying scientifically-based controls to analyze hazards, identify and monitor critical control points, and establish corrective actions when monitoring shows that a critical limit has not been met. Since 1976, we have required routine microbiological testing of seafood and other commodities for quality and microbiological safety. In addition, our total quality managers and third party auditors visit each restaurant periodically throughout the year to review food handling and to provide education and training in food safety and sanitation. The total quality managers also serve as a liaison to regulatory agencies on issues relating to food safety.

Purchasing and Distribution 

Our ability to ensure a consistent supply of high-quality food and supplies at competitive prices to all of our restaurant brands depends on reliable sources of procurement. Our purchasing staff sources, negotiates and purchases food and supplies from more than 2,000 suppliers whose products originate in more than 30 countries. Suppliers must meet our requirements and strict quality control standards in the development, harvest, catch and production of food products. Competitive bids, long-term contracts and long-term vendor relationships are routinely used to manage availability and cost of products.

We believe that our seafood purchasing capabilities are a significant competitive advantage. Our purchasing staff travels routinely within the United States and internationally to source more than 100 varieties of top-quality seafood at competitive prices. We believe that we have established excellent long-term relationships with key seafood vendors and usually source our product directly from producers (not brokers or middlemen). While the supply of certain seafood species is volatile, we believe we have the ability to identify alternative seafood products and to adjust our menus as necessary. 

All other essential food products are available, or can be made available upon short notice, from alternative qualified suppliers. We continue to progress in automating our supply chain allowing our suppliers, logistics partners and distributors to improve optimization with information visibility. Through our subsidiary, Darden Direct Distribution, Inc. ("Darden Direct"), and long-term agreements with our third party national distribution companies we maintain inventory ownership in dedicated environments where practical. Darden Direct further enables our purchasing staff to integrate demand forecasts into long-term agreements driving efficiencies in production economics when we collaborate with vendors. We continue to invest in new technologies to improve restaurant product orders, receiving, invoice approval and inventories across the supply chain. This improves the ability of our logistics infrastructure to replenish restaurants with the right products, at the right price and with just-in-time delivery. Because of the relatively rapid turnover of perishable food products, inventories in the restaurants have a modest aggregate dollar value in relation to sales. 

Our supplier diversity initiative, which focuses on women- and minority-owned businesses, is the major driver behind Darden's efforts to bring about diversity awareness and opportunities within our supplier network. We actively support several national minority supplier organizations to ensure that Darden incorporates women- and minority-owned businesses in all of its purchasing decisions. 

Advertising and Marketing 

We believe we have developed significant marketing and advertising capabilities. Our size enables us to be a leading advertiser in the full service dining segment of the restaurant industry. Olive Garden leverages the efficiency of national network television advertising. Olive Garden supplements this with cable, local television and digital advertising. LongHorn Steakhouse began using national cable 

8
television advertising in fiscal 2011. In addition, LongHorn Steakhouse uses local television and digital advertising to strengthen its brand awareness. The Capital Grille, Yard House, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52 and Eddie V's do not use national television advertising. Our restaurants appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers and we use advertising to create awareness and to attract guests. We implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase our sales and profits, as well as strengthen our brands. We also rely on outdoor billboard, direct mail and email advertising, as well as radio, newspapers, digital coupons, search engine marketing and social media such as Facebook® and Twitter®, as appropriate, to attract and retain guests. During fiscal 2013, we launched electronic gift cards that can be ordered on all of our brand websites and sent instantly online. Buyers can personalize these e-gift cards by recording their voices, attaching photos and letting Facebook friends know they have bought a card. We have developed and consistently use sophisticated consumer marketing research techniques to monitor guest satisfaction and evolving expectations. 

In fiscal 2014, we began efforts to consolidate our brands into a single digital technology platform, strengthen brand relevance and drive longer-term sales growth. The new digital platform will enable our brands to tailor marketing programs to enhance consumer relevance and strengthen brand loyalty. We also developed and tested a new online ordering system for Olive Garden. We expect to implement this new system on a nationwide basis in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2014, Olive Garden continued to develop Spanish language advertising to increase awareness and visits from Hispanic consumers.

Employees 

At the end of fiscal 2014, we employed approximately 206,000 people in the United States and Canada. Of these employees, approximately 196,000 were hourly restaurant personnel. The remainder were restaurant management personnel located in the restaurants or in the field, or were located at one of our restaurant support center facilities in Orlando, Florida or Irvine, California. Our executives have an average of 14 years of experience with us. The restaurant general managers and managing partners average 13 years with us. We believe that we provide working conditions and compensation that compare favorably with those of our competitors. Most employees, other than restaurant management and corporate management, are paid on an hourly basis. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.

In January 2014, we were recognized for the fourth consecutive year by FORTUNE magazine as one of the “100 Best Companies to Work For” in America. We are committed to fostering a strong, values-based culture where employees can learn, thrive and grow. 

Consistent with our core value of diversity, we are committed to attracting, retaining, engaging and developing a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our guests. Approximately 47 percent of our restaurant team member employees are minorities and over 53 percent are female. According to the People Report's Human Capital Intelligence Report for April 2014, the diversity of our operations leadership teams exceed the industry averages by 7 percentage points for minority and 7 percentage points for female representation. Over 24 percent of our executives are minorities and 31 percent are female. The percentages of minority and female executives rank above average in our industry. In addition, we achieved a 100 percent score on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index for our business practices and policies toward our lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. 

Consistent with our core values of respect and caring and teamwork, in fiscal 1999 we established a program called Darden Dimes to help fellow Darden colleagues in need. Darden Dimes has helped employees weather the after-effects of hurricanes and other natural disasters, severe medical problems and other personal difficulties. Participating employees donate at least 10 cents from each paycheck to the Darden Dimes fund, which raises more than $1.7 million annually.

Information Technology 

We strive for leadership in the restaurant business by using technology as a competitive advantage and as an enabler of our strategy. Since 1975, computers located in the restaurants have been used to assist in the management of the restaurants. We have implemented technology-enabled business solutions targeted at improved financial control, cost management, enhanced guest service and improved employee effectiveness. These solutions are designed to be used across restaurant brands, yet are flexible enough to meet the unique needs of each restaurant brand. Our strategy is to fully integrate systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable restaurant teams to focus on restaurant operations excellence. Over the past few years, we completed the implementation of a talent acquisition system across all brands to help streamline the hiring process for front line employee candidates. Additionally, we implemented a new meal pacing system and a new table management system to enhance the guest experience by providing accurate wait times, pacing the preparation of menu items based on cook-times and enhancing restaurant capacity by increasing table turns. 

In fiscal 2014, we continued a multi-year effort to implement new technology platforms that will allow us to digitally engage with our guests and employees and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in this increasingly connected society. These technology platforms will be leveraged across all brands to build guest loyalty and employee engagement. Ultimately this multi-year effort will be integrated into all guest touch points including restaurant operating systems to enable compelling personalized guest experiences. 

Restaurant hardware and software support for all of our restaurant brands is provided or coordinated from the restaurant support center facility in Orlando, Florida. A high-speed data network sends and receives critical business data to and from the restaurants throughout 

9
the day and night, providing timely and extensive information on business activity in every location. Our data center contains sufficient computing power to process information from all restaurants quickly and efficiently. Our information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets. We guard against business interruption by maintaining a disaster recovery plan, which includes storing critical business information off-site, testing the disaster recovery plan at a host-site facility and providing on-site power backup via a large diesel generator. We use internally developed proprietary software, as well as purchased software, with proven, non-proprietary hardware. This allows processing power to be distributed effectively to each of our restaurants.

Our management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will position us well to support current needs and future growth. We are committed to maintaining an industry leadership position in information systems and computing technology. We use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business advantage criteria.

Competition

The restaurant industry is intensely competitive with respect to the type and quality of food, price, service, restaurant location, personnel, brand, attractiveness of facilities, and effectiveness of advertising and marketing. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and consumers’ discretionary purchasing power. We compete within each market with national and regional chains and locally-owned restaurants for guests, management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. We also face growing competition from the supermarket industry, which offers “convenient meals” in the form of improved entrées and side dishes from the deli section. In addition, improving product offerings at fast casual restaurants and quick-service restaurants, together with negative economic conditions, could cause consumers to choose less expensive alternatives. We expect intense competition to continue in all of these areas.

Other factors pertaining to our competitive position in the industry are addressed under the sections entitled “Purchasing and Distribution,” “Advertising and Marketing” and “Information Technology” in this Item 1 and in our Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

Trademarks and Service Marks

We regard our Darden®, Darden Restaurants®, Olive Garden®, Red Lobster®, LongHorn Steakhouse®, The Capital Grille®, Yard House®, Bahama Breeze®, Seasons 52®, Eddie V's Prime Seafood® and Wildfish Seafood Grille® service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and as being important to our marketing efforts. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important service marks and trademarks and to oppose vigorously any infringement of them. Generally, with appropriate renewal and use, the registration of our service marks and trademarks will continue indefinitely.

Franchises, Joint Ventures and New Business Development 

As of May 25, 2014, we operated through subsidiaries 2,207 restaurants in the United States and Canada all of which are owned by us, except three restaurants located in Central Florida and three restaurants in California, seven franchised restaurants in Puerto Rico and one Atlanta, Georgia airport location. The three restaurants located in Florida and three restaurants located in California are owned by joint ventures managed by us. The joint ventures pay management fees to us, and we control the joint ventures’ use of our service marks. In fiscal 2014, we entered into a license agreement with respect to the Atlanta, Georgia airport location. The seven LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in Puerto Rico are franchised to an unaffiliated franchisee as part of an agreement that was executed prior to our fiscal 2007 acquisition of RARE. In April 2012, we entered into a new area development agreement with this same franchisee to develop and operate our Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse brands in Puerto Rico. In January 2013, we amended the new area development agreement which now calls for the franchisee to initially develop a minimum of eight Olive Garden restaurants, three Red Lobster restaurants and three additional LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in Puerto Rico by 2017. 

Our restaurant operations outside of the United States and Canada are conducted through area development and franchise agreements. We have an agreement with an unaffiliated Japanese corporation that operated 23 Red Lobster restaurants in Japan as of May 25, 2014. In October 2010, we entered into a formal agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in the Middle East. The agreement calls for the operator to develop a minimum of 60 restaurants in Bahrain, Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over the next five years. As of May 25, 2014, we have 12 restaurants in the region (two Red Lobster restaurants and one Olive Garden restaurant in United Arab Emirates, one Red Lobster restaurant in Qatar, two Red Lobster restaurants and three Olive Garden restaurants in Kuwait and two Red Lobster restaurants and a LongHorn Steakhouse restaurant in Saudi Arabia), open under this agreement. In August 2011, we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate Olive Garden, Red Lobster and The Capital Grille brands in Mexico. The agreement calls for the operator to initially develop a minimum of 37 restaurants in Mexico over the next five years. As of May 25, 2014, five Olive Garden restaurants, one Red Lobster restaurant and one The Capital Grille restaurant had been opened in Mexico under this agreement. 

10
In February 2013, we entered into a formal agreement with an unaffiliated operator to develop and operate Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse brands in Central and South America. The agreement calls for the operator to develop a minimum of 57 restaurants in Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Panama. As of May 25, 2014, one Red Lobster restaurant and one Olive Garden restaurant have been opened in Brazil under this agreement, and the rights to develop the Panama territory have been sold to the operator of our restaurant locations in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. In July 2013, we entered into separate formal agreements with two unaffiliated operators to develop and operate Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse restaurants in Central America and South America. One agreement calls for the operator to develop the restaurants in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica (and, as amended, Panama). The other agreement calls for the second unaffiliated operator to develop the restaurants in Peru. As of May 25, 2014, one Olive Garden restaurant has been opened in Peru. All area development and franchise agreements to develop and operate Red Lobster restaurants are included in the anticipated sale of Red Lobster. We do not have an ownership interest in any of these franchisees, but we receive royalty income under the area development and franchise agreements. The amount of income we derive from our joint venture and franchise arrangements is not material to our consolidated financial statements. 

During fiscal 2013, and continuing in fiscal 2014, we achieved distribution for several items at Walmart, including Olive Garden regular and light salad dressing, extra virgin olive oil, two sizes of Balsamic vinegar, LongHorn seasoning and Olive Garden seasoning. We also distributed certain Red Lobster-related products, including the cheddar bay biscuit mix and Red Lobster seasoning, that will all be included in the proposed Red Lobster sale. We have expanded Olive Garden salad dressing into broad distribution channels including most major grocery chains. We also are researching and developing proprietary technology for lobster aquaculture farming. 

Seasonality

Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally. Typically, our average sales per restaurant are highest in the spring and winter, followed by the summer, and lowest in the fall. Holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 

Government Regulation 

We are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws affecting our business. Each of our restaurants must comply with licensing requirements and regulations by a number of governmental authorities, which include health, safety and fire agencies in the state or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The development and operation of restaurants depend on selecting and acquiring suitable sites, which are subject to zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals.

During fiscal 2014, 11.0 percent of our sales were attributable to the sale of alcoholic beverages. Regulations governing their sale require licensure by each site (in most cases, on an annual basis), and licenses may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. These regulations relate to many aspects of restaurant operation, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling, and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. The failure of a restaurant to obtain or retain these licenses would adversely affect the restaurant’s operations. We also are subject in certain states to “dram-shop” statutes, which generally provide an injured party with recourse against an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person who then causes injury to himself or a third party. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our comprehensive general liability insurance.

We also are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws governing such matters as overtime, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards, and hiring and employment practices. Changes in these laws during fiscal 2014 have not had a material effect on our operations.

We currently are operating under a Tip Rate Alternative Commitment (“TRAC”) agreement with the Internal Revenue Service. Through increased educational and other efforts in the restaurants, the TRAC agreement reduces the likelihood of potential chain-wide employer-only FICA assessments for unreported tips.

We are subject to federal and state environmental regulations, but these rules have not had a material effect on our operations. During fiscal 2014, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities and no material expenditures for this purpose are anticipated.

Our facilities must comply with the applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”) and related state accessibility statutes. Under the ADA and related state laws, we must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant remodeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible.

11
We continue to review the health care reform law enacted by Congress in March of 2010 (“Affordable Care Act”) and related rules and regulations. As part of that review, we evaluate the potential impacts of this law on our business, and accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect.

We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are or may become subject to laws and regulations requiring disclosure of calorie, fat, trans fat, salt and allergen content. The Affordable Care Act requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. The Food and Drug Administration has proposed rules to implement this provision that would require restaurants to post the number of calories for most items on menus or menu boards and to make available more detailed nutrition information upon request.

We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information.

See Item 1A “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state and local regulation of our business, including in the areas of health care reform, data privacy and environmental matters.

Sustainability 

Darden's commitment to sustainability has evolved over time to become a key component of our industry leadership, an element that separates us from our competitors, and a contributor to our business success. Our approach is both integrated and strategic and spans the enterprise from the commodities we source to the operation of our restaurants. Conservation is a competitive advantage - it will lower our operating costs, insulate our supply chain, help us attract and retain employees - all increasing the success of our business.

More information about our sustainability strategy, how we are implementing that strategy and our progress to date is available through our sustainability report available on our website at www.darden.com/sustainability.

Health and Wellness 

In September 2011, we announced a comprehensive health and wellness commitment to reduce our calorie and sodium footprints and to provide greater choice and variety on our children's menus. Across our brands, we are working toward a 10 percent reduction of calories and sodium over five years and a 20 percent reduction of calories and sodium over 10 years. And we are establishing specific nutrition standards to guide the development of our children's meals to simplify parental search for healthier options that their children enjoy. 

Darden Foundation and Community Affairs 

We are recognized for a culture that rewards caring for and responding to people. That defines service for Darden. The Darden Restaurants, Inc. Foundation ("Foundation") works to bring to life this spirit of service through its philanthropic support of charitable organizations across the country as well as the volunteer involvement of our employees. The Foundation does this by focusing its philanthropic efforts on the following key program areas: access to postsecondary education; preservation of natural resources; and good neighbor grants.

In April 2014, the Foundation announced it was awarding more than $2.1 million to nearly 900 nonprofit organizations in communities across the U.S. and Canada as part of its Darden Restaurants Community Grants Program. The local grants program is intended to help support nonprofit organizations in the hundreds of communities we serve. Each of our restaurants had the opportunity to help award a $1,000 grant to a nonprofit organization in its local community. 

More information about the Foundation and its efforts to enhance the quality of life in the communities where we do business, including its annual Community Service Report, is available on our website at www.darden.com.
