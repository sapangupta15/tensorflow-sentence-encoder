Business Segments  

Duke Energy conducts its operations in three business segments; Regulated Utilities, International Energy and Commercial Power. The remainder of Duke Energy’s operations are presented as Other. Duke Energy’s chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. For additional information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Business Segments.”  

The following sections describe the business and operations of each of Duke Energy’s reportable business segments, as well as Other. 

regulated utilities 

Regulated Utilities conducts operations primarily through Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana, and the regulated transmission and distribution operations of Duke Energy Ohio. These electric and gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, the North Carolina Utilities Commission (NCUC), the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (PSCSC), the Florida Public Service Commission (FPSC), the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), and the Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC).  

Regulated Utilities serves 7.2 million retail electric customers in six states in the Southeast and Midwest regions of the United States. Its service area covers approximately 104,000 square miles with an estimated population of 21 million people. Regulated Utilities serves 500,000 retail natural gas customers in southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. Electricity is also sold wholesale to incorporated municipalities, electric cooperative utilities and other load-serving entities. 

The following table represents the distribution of billed sales by customer class for the year ended December 31, 2013.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The number of residential, general service and industrial customers within the Regulated Utilities service territory is expected to increase over time. However, growth in the near-term is being hampered by the current economic conditions. Average usage per residential customer is  

9  

PART I  

expected to remain flat for the foreseeable future. While total industrial sales increased in 2013 when compared to 2012, the growth rate was modest when compared to historical periods.  

Seasonality and the Impact of Weather 

Regulated Utilities’ costs and revenues are influenced by seasonal patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, resulting in higher revenue and cash flows in these periods. By contrast, lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance. Peak gas sales occur during the winter months. Residential and general service customers are most impacted by weather. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions. 

The estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the number of customers, temperature variances from a normal condition and customers’ historic usage levels and patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not and cannot consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity and relative temperature changes. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter term periods. 

Degree-day data are used to estimate energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures based on each day’s average temperature. Heating-degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. Cooling-degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating-degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling-degree day. 

Competition 

Retail 

Regulated Utilities’ businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories, with the exception of Ohio, which has a competitive electricity supply market. Regulated Utilities owns and operates all of the facilities necessary to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. Services are priced by state commission approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices. Competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from on-site generation of industrial customers and distributed generation, such as rooftop solar, at residential, general service and/or industrial customer sites. 

Regulated Utilities is not aware of any proposed legislation in any jurisdiction that would give its retail customers the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry.  

Although there is no pending legislation at this time, if the retail jurisdictions served by Regulated Utilities become subject to deregulation, the recovery of stranded costs could become a significant consideration. Stranded costs primarily include the generation assets of Regulated Utilities whose value in a competitive marketplace may be less than their current book value, as well as above-market purchased power commitments from qualified facilities (QFs). QFs are typically small power production facilities that generate power within a utility company’s service territory for which the utility companies are legally obligated to purchase the energy at an avoided cost rate. Thus far, all states that have passed restructuring legislation have provided for the opportunity to recover a substantial portion of stranded costs.  

Regulated Utilities’ largest stranded cost exposure is primarily related to Duke Energy Florida’s purchased power commitments with QFs, under which it has future minimum expected capacity payments through 2025 of $3.5 billion. Duke Energy Florida was obligated to enter into these contracts under provisions of the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. Duke Energy Florida continues to seek ways to address the impact of escalating payments under these contracts. However, the FPSC allows full recovery of the retail portion of the cost of power purchased from QFs. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies” for additional information related these purchased power commitments. 

In Ohio, Regulated Utilities conducts competitive auctions for electricity supply. The cost of energy purchased through these auctions is recovered from retail customers. Regulated Utilities earns retail margin in Ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity only and not on the cost of the underlying energy.  

Wholesale 

Regulated Utilities competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales, sales to municipalities and cooperatives, and wholesale transactions. The principal factors in competing for these sales are price, availability of capacity and power, and reliability of service. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs. 

Increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect Regulated Utilities’ load forecasts, plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of Regulated Utilities to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. 

Energy Capacity and Resources  

Regulated Utilities owns approximately 50,000 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity. For additional information on Regulated Utilities’ generation facilities, see Item 2, “Properties.” 

Energy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause Regulated Utilities to purchase power for its customers include generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, generation reliability, growth, and price. Regulated Utilities has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy, and reliability of power supply.  

10  

PART I  

Regulated Utilities’ generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve retail customers. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements. 

Recently Completed Generation Projects 

Regulated Utilities completed its generation fleet modernization program in 2013. The additional capacity from this program has allowed Regulated Utilities to retire or plan to retire older, less efficient capacity. The following table summarizes the generation projects constructed and placed in service during the past three years.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Potential Plant Retirements 

The Subsidiary Registrants periodically file Integrated Resource Plans (IRP) with state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted energy needs over a long term (15-20 years) and options being considered to meet those needs. The IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants in 2013 and 2012 included planning assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities earlier than their current estimated useful lives. These facilities do not have the requisite emission control equipment, primarily to meet U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations that are not yet effective. These facilities total approximately 2,447 MW at five sites. Duke Energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal-fired generating facilities earlier than the current estimated useful lives, and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any assets are retired. For additional information related to potential plant retirements see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters.” 

Sources of Electricity 

Regulated Utilities relies principally on coal, natural gas and nuclear fuel for its generation of electricity. The following table lists sources of electricity and fuel costs for the three years ended December 31, 2013.  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Coal 

Regulated Utilities meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and short-term spot market purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under long-term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. Regulated Utilities uses spot-market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates for its long-term contracts, which have various price adjustment provisions and market re-openers, range from 2014 to 2016 for Duke Energy Carolinas, 2014 to 2018 for Duke Energy Progress, 2014 to 2016 for Duke Energy Florida, and 2014 to 2025 for Duke Energy Indiana. Regulated Utilities expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. Coal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Florida is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Indiana is primarily produced in Indiana and Illinois. Regulated Utilities has an adequate supply of coal under contract to fuel its projected 2014 operations and a significant portion of supply to fuel its projected 2015 operations. Coal inventory levels have begun to normalize during the past year as weather patterns have trended closer to historical averages, combined with improving economic indicators and higher natural gas prices, which are resulting in higher coal-fired generation. Significantly colder than normal temperatures in December 2013 and January 2014 continued the trend of higher natural gas prices and increased coal-fired generation. 

11  

PART I  

The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by Regulated Utilities is between 1.5 percent and 2 percent for Duke Energy Carolinas, between 1.5 percent and 2 percent for Duke Energy Progress, between 1 percent and 2.5 percent for Duke Energy Florida, and between 2 percent and 3 percent for Duke Energy Indiana. Regulated Utilities’ environmental controls, in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission allowances, enable Regulated Utilities to satisfy current SO2 emission limitations for its existing facilities. 

Nuclear 

The industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, and services to convert, enrich, and fabricate fuel assemblies.  

Regulated Utilities has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. Regulated Utilities staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near-term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services, Regulated Utilities generally sources these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multi-year contracts.  

Regulated Utilities has entered into fuel contracts that cover 100 percent of its uranium concentrates, conversion services, and enrichment services requirements through at least 2014 and cover fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least 2018. For future requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, Regulated Utilities believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire, or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services.  

Oil and Gas 

Oil and natural gas supply for Regulated Utilities’ generation fleet is purchased under term and spot contracts from various suppliers. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana use derivative instruments to limit a portion of their exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas. Regulated Utilities has dual-fuel generating facilities that can operate with both fuel oil and natural gas. The cost of Regulated Utilities’ oil and natural gas is either at a fixed price or determined by market prices as reported in certain industry publications. Regulated Utilities believes it has access to an adequate supply of oil and gas for the reasonably foreseeable future. Regulated Utilities’ natural gas transportation for its gas generation is purchased under term firm transportation contracts with interstate and intrastate pipelines. Regulated Utilities may also purchase additional shorter-term transportation for its load requirements during peak periods. The Regulated Utilities natural gas plants are served by several supply zones and multiple pipelines. 

Purchased Power 

Regulated Utilities purchased approximately 11.7 million megawatt-hours (MWh), 19.8 million MWh and 19.0 million MWh of its system energy requirements during 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, under purchase obligations and leases and had 3,800 and 4,500 MW of firm purchased capacity under contract during 2013 and 2012, respectively. These amounts include MWh for Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida for all periods presented. These agreements include approximately 398 MW of firm capacity under contract by Duke Energy Florida with certain QFs. Regulated Utilities may need to acquire additional purchased power capacity in the future to accommodate a portion of its system load needs. Regulated Utilities believes that it can obtain adequate purchased power to meet these needs. However, during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly affected. 

Gas for Retail Distribution 

Regulated Utilities is responsible for the purchase and the subsequent delivery of natural gas to retail customers in its Ohio and Kentucky service territories. Regulated Utilities’ natural gas procurement strategy is to buy firm natural gas supplies and firm interstate pipeline transportation capacity during the winter season and during the non-heating season through a combination of firm supply and transportation capacity along with spot supply and interruptible transportation capacity. This strategy allows Regulated Utilities to assure reliable natural gas supply for its non-curtailable customers during peak winter conditions and provides Regulated Utilities the flexibility to reduce its contract commitments if firm customers choose alternate gas. In 2013, firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided approximately 100 percent of the natural gas supply. 

Inventory 

Generation of electricity is capital intensive. Regulated Utilities must maintain an adequate stock of fuel and materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2013, the inventory balance for Regulated Utilities was $3,043 million. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for additional information.  

Dan River Ash Basin Release 

On February 2, 2014, a break in a stormwater pipe beneath an ash basin at Duke Energy Carolinas’ retired Dan River steam station caused a release of ash basin water and ash into the Dan River. On February 8, 2014, a permanent plug was installed in the stormwater pipe stopping the release of materials into the river. Duke Energy Carolinas estimates 30,000 to 39,000 tons of ash and 24 million to 27 million gallons of basin water were released into the river. 

Duke Energy cannot reasonably estimate the cost associated with remediation of this release at this time. Other costs related to the Dan River release and other ash basins, including regulatory directives, natural resources damages, future lawsuits, future claims, long-term environmental impact costs, long-term operational changes, and costs associated with new laws and regulations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

PART I  

Nuclear Matters 

Regulated Utilities owns, wholly or partially, 12 nuclear reactors located at seven stations. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property, decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and replacement power expense coverage. Joint owners reimburse Regulated Utilities for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which currently is $13.6 billion. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies — Nuclear Insurance,” for more information. 

Regulated Utilities has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC, FPSC and PSCSC require Regulated Utilities to update their cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years. 

The following table summarizes the fair value of nuclear decommissioning trust fund (NDTF) balances and cost study results for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, and Duke Energy Florida. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The NCUC, FPSC and PSCSC have allowed Regulated Utilities’ to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail rates over the expected remaining service periods of their nuclear stations. Regulated Utilities believes the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with the existing fund balance and expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” for more information. 

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) (NWPA) provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high-level radioactive waste materials. The NWPA promotes increased usage of interim storage of spent nuclear fuel at existing nuclear plants. Regulated Utilities will continue to maximize the use of spent fuel storage capability within its own facilities for as long as feasible.  

Under federal law, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. Delays have occurred in the DOE’s proposed permanent repository to be located at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. 

Until the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will continue to safely manage their spent nuclear fuel. With certain modifications and additional approvals by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), including the expansion of on-site dry cask storage facilities, spent nuclear fuel storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space for spent fuel through the expiration of the operating licenses, including any license renewals, for all sites except Shearon Harris Nuclear Station (Harris) and Crystal River Unit 3. Under current regulatory guidelines, Harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license. Crystal River Unit 3 was retired in 2013, with plans to place the facility in SAFSTOR (extended storage) prior to final decommissioning. An on-site dry cask storage facility will be installed to accommodate storage of all spent nuclear fuel until the DOE accepts the spent nuclear fuel. 

The nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long-term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital outlays for modifications and new plant construction, the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning plants at the end of their licensed lives, and requirements relating to nuclear insurance. Nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages, repairs, uprates and certain other modifications. 

Regulated Utilities is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design, construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. The following table includes the current expiration of nuclear operating licenses. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

13  

PART I  

The NRC issues orders with regard to security at nuclear plants in response to new or emerging threats. The most recent orders include additional restrictions on nuclear plant access, increased security measures at nuclear facilities and closer coordination with intelligence, military, law enforcement and emergency response functions at the federal, state and local levels. As the NRC, other governmental entities and the industry continue to consider security issues, it is possible that more extensive security plans could be required. 

Regulation  

State  

The NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC, PUCO, IURC and KPSC (collectively, the state utility commissions) approve rates for retail electric and gas service within their respective states. The state utility commissions, except for the PUCO, also have authority over the construction and operation of Regulated Utilities’ generating facilities. Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) issued by the state utility commissions, as applicable, authorize Regulated Utilities to construct and operate its electric facilities, and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state utility commission is required for Regulated Utilities to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity. 

Each of the state utility commissions allows recovery of certain costs through various cost-recovery clauses, to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered costs, are prudent. The clauses are in addition to approved base rates.  

Fuel, fuel-related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by Regulated Utilities. Regulated Utilities uses coal, oil, hydroelectric, natural gas and nuclear fuel to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of Regulated Utilities, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery from ratepayers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of Regulated Utilities.  

The following table summarizes base rate cases approved and effective in the past three years. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For more information on rate matters and other regulatory proceedings, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters — Rate Related Information.”  

14  

PART I  

Federal  

The FERC approves Regulated Utilities’ cost-based rates for electric sales to certain wholesale customers, as well as sales of transmission service. Regulations of FERC and the state utility commissions govern access to regulated electric and gas customers and other data by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of nonregulated affiliates with Regulated Utilities.  

Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO). PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) and Midcontinent Independent Transmission System Operator, Inc. (MISO) are the Independent System Operators (ISO) and FERC-approved RTOs for the regions in which Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana operate. PJM and MISO operate energy, capacity and other markets, and, through central dispatch, control the day-to-day operations of bulk power systems. 

Duke Energy Ohio is a member of PJM and Duke Energy Indiana is a member of MISO. Transmission owners in these RTOs have turned over control of their transmission facilities, and their transmission systems are currently under the dispatch control of the RTOs. Transmission service is provided on a region-wide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the RTO members at rates based on the costs of transmission service. 

Environmental. Regulated Utilities is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. For a discussion of environmental regulation, see “Environmental Matters” in this section.  

See “Other Issues” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development and the potential impacts such legislation and regulation could have on Duke Energy’s operations.  

INTERNATIONAL ENERGY 

International Energy principally operates and manages power generation facilities and engages in sales and marketing of electric power, natural gas, and natural gas liquids outside the U.S. Its activities principally target power generation in Latin America. Additionally, International Energy owns a 25 percent interest in National Methanol Company (NMC), a large regional producer of methanol and methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) located in Saudi Arabia. International Energy’s ownership interest will decrease to 17.5 percent by the end of 2016. The investment in NMC is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. 

International Energy’s customers include retail distributors, electric utilities, independent power producers, marketers, and industrial and commercial companies. International Energy’s current strategy is focused on optimizing the value of its current Latin American portfolio and expanding the portfolio through investment in generation opportunities in Latin America.  

For information on International Energy’s generation facilities, see Item 2, “Properties.”  

Competition and Regulation  

International Energy’s sales and marketing of electric power and natural gas competes directly with other generators and marketers serving its market areas. Competitors are country and region-specific but include government-owned electric generating companies, local distribution companies with self-generation capability and other privately owned electric generating and marketing companies. The principal elements of competition are price and availability, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.  

A high percentage of International Energy’s portfolio consists of baseload hydroelectric generation facilities, which compete with other forms of electric generation available to International Energy’s customers and end-users, including natural gas and fuel oils. Economic activity, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, weather, additional generation capacities and other factors affect the supply and demand for electricity in the regions served by International Energy. 

International Energy’s operations are subject to both country-specific and international laws and regulations. (See “Environmental Matters” in this section.)  

COMMERCIAL POWER 

Commercial Power owns, operates and manages power plants and engages in the wholesale marketing and procurement of electric power, fuel and emission allowances related to these plants as well as other contractual positions. Commercial Power’s generation operations consist primarily of Duke Energy Ohio’s coal-fired and gas-fired nonregulated generation assets located in the Midwest region of the United States and wind and solar generation located throughout the United States. The asset portfolio has a diversified fuel mix with baseload and mid-merit coal-fired units as well as combined cycle and peaking natural gas-fired units.  

Generation from the coal-fired and gas-fired assets is dispatched into the PJM wholesale market. These assets earn energy and capacity revenue at market prices. Duke Energy Ohio is a PJM Fixed Resource Requirement (FRR) entity through May 31, 2015. As an FRR entity, Duke Energy Ohio is obligated to self-supply capacity for the Duke Energy Ohio load zone. Commercial Power has economically hedged its forecasted coal-fired generation and a significant portion of its forecasted gas-fired generation for 2014. Commercial Power also has long-term economic hedges in place for a portion of expected coal and gas generation through 2017 and 2018, respectively. Capacity revenues are 100 percent fixed in PJM through May 2017. 

Energy and renewable energy credits generated by wind and solar projects are generally sold at contractual prices. Contracts are executed with load serving entities, which, in most instances, have obligations under state-mandated renewable energy portfolio standards or similar state or local renewable energy goals. Most contracts have a term which approximates the estimated useful life of the underlying generation project. In addition, Commercial Power operates and develops transmission projects. 

For information on Commercial Power’s generation facilities, see Item 2, “Properties.” 

15  

PART I  

Commercial Power also has a retail sales subsidiary, Duke Energy Retail Sales, LLC (Duke Energy Retail), which is certified by the PUCO as a Competitive Retail Electric Supplier (CRES) provider in Ohio. Duke Energy Retail serves retail electric and gas customers in Ohio with energy and other energy services at competitive rates. 

Capacity Rider Filing 

On August 29, 2012, Duke Energy Ohio applied to the PUCO for the establishment of a charge for capacity provided pursuant to its obligations as an FRR entity. The charge, which is consistent with Ohio’s state compensation mechanism, is estimated to be approximately $729 million, and reflects Duke Energy Ohio’s embedded cost of capacity. On February 13, 2013, the PUCO denied Duke Energy Ohio’s request. 

Midwest Generation Exit 

On February 17, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio announced that it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing period of several months and potential regulatory approvals, Duke Energy Ohio expects to dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to mid-2015. In the first quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio will reclassify approximately $3.5 billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to assets held for sale and expects to record an estimated pretax impairment charge of $1 billion to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated sales proceeds less cost to sell. 

Other Matters 

Commercial Power is subject to regulation at the federal level, primarily from the FERC. Regulations of the FERC govern access to regulated electric customer and other data by nonregulated entities, services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates, and Commercial Power’s investments in transmission projects. These regulations affect the activities of Commercial Power. 

For more information on rate matters, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters — Rate Related Information.”  

Commercial Power is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. (For a discussion of environmental regulation, see “Environmental Matters” in this section.)  

See “Other Issues” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development, and the potential impacts such legislation could have on Duke Energy’s operations.  

Market Environment and Competition 

The market price of commodities and services, along with the quality and reliability of services provided, drive competition in the wholesale energy business. Commercial Power’s main competitors include other nonregulated generators and wholesale power providers.  

Sources of Electricity 

Commercial Power relies on coal and natural gas for its generation of electric energy.  

Coal 

Commercial Power meets its coal demand through a portfolio of purchase supply contracts and spot agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under supply contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. Commercial Power uses spot-market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by supply contracts. Expiration dates for its supply contracts, which have various price adjustment provisions and market re-openers, range through 2018. Commercial Power expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers for the quantities and quality of coal required as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. The majority of Commercial Power’s coal is sourced from mines in the Northern Appalachian and Illinois basins. Commercial Power has an adequate supply of coal to fuel its projected 2014 operations. The majority of Commercial Power’s coal-fired generation is equipped with environmental controls. As a result, Commercial Power is able to satisfy the current emission limitations for SO2 for existing facilities.  

Gas 

Commercial Power is responsible for the purchase of natural gas to its gas turbine generators. In general Commercial Power hedges its natural gas requirements using physical and financial contracts. Physical gas is purchased in the spot market and under long-term contracts to meet generation needs.  

OTHER 

The remainder of Duke Energy’s operations is presented as Other. While it is not an operating segment, Other primarily includes unallocated corporate interest expense, certain unallocated corporate costs, Bison Insurance Company Limited (Bison), Duke Energy’s wholly owned, captive insurance subsidiary, contributions to the Duke Energy Foundation, and other investments in businesses the Company is in various stages of exiting or winding down. On December 31, 2013, Duke Energy sold its interest in DukeNet Communications Holdings, LLC (DukeNet) to Time Warner Cable, Inc. Following the repayment of existing DukeNet indebtedness at closing, transaction expenses and other purchase price adjustments, Duke Energy received cash proceeds of approximately $215 million. 

Bison’s principal activities as a captive insurance entity include the indemnification of various business risks and losses, such as property, business interruption, workers’ compensation and general liability of subsidiaries and affiliates of Duke Energy. 

Regulation 

Certain entities within Other are subject to the jurisdiction of state and local agencies.

COMMERCIAL POWER 

Commercial Power owns, operates and manages power plants and engages in the wholesale marketing and procurement of electric power, fuel and emission allowances related to these plants, as well as other contractual positions.

The asset portfolio has a diversified fuel mix with baseload and mid-merit coal-fired units as well as combined cycle and peaking natural gas-fired units. Generation from the coal-fired and gas-fired assets is dispatched into the PJM wholesale market. These assets earn energy and capacity revenue at market prices. See Item 2, “Properties”, for further discussion of Duke Energy Ohio’s Commercial Power generating facilities. 

On February 17, 2014, Duke Energy Ohio announced that it had initiated a process to exit its nonregulated Midwest generation business. Considering a marketing period of several months and potential regulatory approvals, Duke Energy Ohio expects to dispose of the nonregulated Midwest generation business by early to mid-2015. In the first quarter of 2014, Duke Energy Ohio will reclassify approximately $3.5 billion carrying value of its Midwest generation business to assets held for sale and expects to record an estimated pretax impairment charge of $1 billion to $2 billion to reduce the carrying value to estimated sales proceeds less cost to sell.
