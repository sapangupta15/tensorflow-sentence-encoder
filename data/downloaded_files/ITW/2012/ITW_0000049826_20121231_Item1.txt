Divestiture of Majority Interest in Decorative Surfaces Segment

On August 15, 2012, the Company entered into a definitive agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) to divest a 51% majority interest in its Decorative Surfaces segment to certain funds managed by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC (“CD&R”). Under the terms of the Investment Agreement, the Company contributed the assets and stock of the Decorative Surfaces segment to a newly formed joint venture, Wilsonart International Holdings LLC (“Wilsonart”). The transaction closed on October 31, 2012, reducing the Company's ownership of Wilsonart to 49% immediately following the close of the transaction. The Company ceased consolidating the results of the Decorative Surfaces segment as of October 31, 2012 and now reports its 49% ownership interest in Wilsonart using the equity method of accounting. Effective November 1, 2012, the Company made changes to its management reporting structure and Decorative Surfaces is no longer a reportable segment of the Company. See the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further discussion of this transaction.

The Decorative Surfaces business produces decorative high-pressure laminate surfacing materials for furniture, office and retail space, countertops, worktops and other applications. Principal end markets served included commercial, renovation and residential construction.

Enterprise Initiatives

During 2012, the Company embarked on three key initiatives - portfolio management, strategic sourcing, and business structure simplification. These initiatives are expected to enhance the business over the next five years and are targeted at organic revenue growth, and improving profitability and returns. 

Portfolio Management

The Company's portfolio management initiative incorporates both acquisitions and divestitures. The Company has historically acquired businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions that represent potential new platforms. Going forward, the focus will be on businesses with strong differentiation and growth potential. The Company also reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its enterprise initiatives and long-term objectives. As a result, the Company expects its divestiture activity in the 2012 to 2014 period to increase over historical periods. Refer to the Acquisitions note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company's acquisitions, the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company's discontinued operations, and the Divestiture of Majority Interest in Decorative Surfaces Segment note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Decorative Surfaces divestiture.

Strategic Sourcing

The Company's strategic sourcing initiative focuses on costs that cross the Company's many businesses and is expected to leverage purchasing scale to enhance profitability and global competitiveness. This initiative will transform sourcing into a core strategic function in the Company and build capabilities at both the enterprise and segment levels.

Business Structure Simplification

The business structure simplification initiative simplifies and adds scale to the Company's operating divisions in order to improve focus, enhance global competitiveness and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative will reduce the number of the Company's operating divisions and increase the average revenue size of each division, while retaining the positive attributes of a decentralized operating model. The Company expects to enhance its profitability and returns through a combination of applying its 80/20 business process to the new divisions, more focused growth investments and reduced infrastructure. 

80/20 Business Process

A key element of the Company’s business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Company’s operations use this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Company’s operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:

•Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value products.

•Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.

•Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.

•Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.

The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results.

Backlog generally is not considered a significant factor in the Company’s businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of its products. Backlog by reportable segment as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Backlog orders scheduled for shipment beyond calendar year 2013 were not material as of December 31, 2012.

The information set forth below is applicable to all reportable segments of the Company unless otherwise noted:

Competition

With operations in 58 countries, the Company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets, many of which are fragmented, and the Company encounters a variety of competitors that vary by product line, end market and geographic area. The Company's competitors include many regional or specialized companies, as well as large U.S. and non-U.S. companies or divisions of large companies. Each of the Company's segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas. In addition to numerous smaller regional competitors, the welding

business in the Power Systems & Electronics segment competes globally with Lincoln Electric.

In virtually all segments, the Company differentiates its businesses from its competitors based on product innovation, product quality, brand preference, service delivery and price. Technical capability is also a competitive factor in most of its segments. The Company believes that for each of its segments, its primary competitive advantages derive from its decentralized operating structure, which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level, enabling its businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics. This structure enables the Company's businesses to drive operational excellence utilizing its 80/20 business process and leverages its product innovation capabilities. The Company also believes that its global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of its markets, especially in its Transportation segment.

Raw Materials

The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily steel, resins, chemicals and paper, that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are currently anticipated.

Research and Development

Developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, and continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment all contribute to the Company’s organic growth. Many new products are designed to reduce customers’ costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly or by improving the quality of customers’ assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Research and development expenses were $266 million in 2012, $243 million in 2011 and $213 million in 2010.

Intellectual Property

The Company owns approximately 3,700 unexpired U.S. patents and 8,000 foreign patents covering articles, methods and machines. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,900 applications for patents pending in the U.S. Patent Office and 4,500 pending in foreign patent offices, but there is no assurance that any of these patents will be issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.

The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important; however, the expiration of any one of the Company’s patents would not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial position. The Company also credits its leadership in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers.

In addition to patents, many of the Company’s products and services are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company in the aggregate. Some of the Company’s more significant trademarks include ITW, which is also used in conjunction with the trademarks of many of the Company's businesses; Deltar and Shakeproof in the Transportation segment; Miller in the Power Systems & Electronics segment; Signode in the Industrial Packaging segment; Hobart in the Food Equipment segment; Paslode in the Construction Products segment; and Instron in the All Other segment.

Environmental

The Company believes that its manufacturing plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Company’s capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.

Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Company’s revenues or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts to develop and sell environmentally compatible products.

Employees

The Company employed approximately 60,000 persons as of December 31, 2012 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.

International

The Company’s international operations include subsidiaries and joint ventures in 57 foreign countries on six continents. These operations serve such end markets as general industrial, automotive, construction, food institutional/restaurant and service, food and beverage, consumer durables, electronics, primary metals, and others on a worldwide basis. The Company’s revenues from sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 57% of revenues in 2012, 59% of revenues in 2011 and 58% of revenues in 2010.

Refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Segment Information note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on international activities. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, including price controls, exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates.
