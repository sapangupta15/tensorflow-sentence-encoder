ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to certain market risks that exist as part of its ongoing business operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, price volatility for certain commodities and changes in interest rates. The Company does not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company’s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt. Refer to Note 8. Debt in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplemental Data for details related to the fair value of Company's debt instruments.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company operates in the U.S. and 55 foreign countries. The funding for the foreign manufacturing operations is provided primarily through the permanent investment of equity capital. The Company’s products are typically manufactured and sold within the same country. Therefore, the Company's manufacturing operations generally do not have significant assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies.

The Company designated €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2014 and €1.0 billion of Euro notes issued in May 2015 as hedges of a portion of its net investment in Euro-denominated foreign operations to reduce foreign currency risk associated with the investment in these operations. Changes in the value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the Euro to U.S. Dollar exchange rate have been recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The cumulative unrealized gain recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the net investment hedge was $81 million and $375 million as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.
