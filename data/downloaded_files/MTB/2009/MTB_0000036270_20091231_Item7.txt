Item 7.    Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    

 Corporate Profile and Significant Developments  

 M&T Bank Corporation (M&T) is a bank holding company headquartered in Buffalo, New York with consolidated assets of $68.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The consolidated financial information presented herein reflects M&T and all of its subsidiaries, which are referred to collectively as the Company. M&Ts wholly owned bank subsidiaries are M&T Bank and M&T Bank, National Association (M&T Bank, N.A.).  

 M&T Bank, with total assets of $67.9 billion at December 31, 2009, is a New York-chartered commercial bank with 793 banking offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia, and an office in the Cayman Islands. M&T Bank and its subsidiaries offer a broad range of financial services to a diverse base of consumers, businesses, professional clients, governmental entities and financial institutions located in their markets. Lending is largely focused on consumers residing in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., and on small and medium size businesses based in those areas, although residential and commercial real estate loans are originated through lending offices in six other states. Certain lending activities are also conducted in other states through various subsidiaries. M&T Banks subsidiaries include: M&T Real Estate Trust, a commercial mortgage lender; M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a multifamily commercial mortgage lender; M&T Securities, Inc., which provides brokerage, investment advisory and insurance services; MTB Investment Advisors, Inc., which serves as investment advisor to the MTB Group of Funds, a family of proprietary mutual funds, and other funds and institutional clients; and M&T Insurance Agency, Inc., an insurance agency.  

 M&T Bank, N.A., with total assets of $908 million at December 31, 2009, is a national bank with an office in Oakfield, New York. M&T Bank, N.A. offers selected deposit and loan products on a nationwide basis, largely through telephone, Internet and direct mail marketing techniques.  

 On August 28, 2009, M&T Bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to assume all of the deposits and acquire certain assets of Bradford Bank (Bradford), Baltimore, Maryland. As part of the transaction, M&T Bank entered into a loss-share arrangement with the FDIC whereby M&T Bank will be reimbursed by the FDIC for most    

 31   
 losses it incurs on the acquired loan portfolio. The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Assets acquired in the transaction totaled approximately $469 million, including $302 million of loans, and liabilities assumed aggregated $440 million, including $361 million of deposits. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), M&T Bank recorded an after-tax gain on the transaction of $18 million ($29 million before taxes).  

 On May 23, 2009, M&T acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Provident Bankshares Corporation (Provident), a bank holding company based in Baltimore, Maryland, in a stock-for-stock transaction. Provident Bank, Providents banking subsidiary, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. The results of operations acquired in the Provident transaction have been included in the Companys financial results since May 23, 2009. Provident common shareholders received .171625 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for each share of Provident common stock, resulting in M&T issuing a total of 5,838,308 common shares with an acquisition date fair value of $273 million. In addition, based on the merger agreement, outstanding and unexercised options to purchase Provident common stock were converted into options to purchase the common stock of M&T. Those options had an estimated fair value of approximately $1 million. In total, the purchase price was approximately $274 million based on the fair value on the acquisition date of M&T common stock exchanged and the options to purchase M&T common stock. Holders of Providents preferred stock were issued shares of new Series B and Series C Preferred Stock of M&T having substantially identical terms. That preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock associated with the Series C Preferred Stock added $162 million to M&Ts stockholders equity. The Series B Preferred Stock has a preference value of $27 million, pays non-cumulative dividends at a rate of 10%, and is convertible into 433,148 shares of M&T common stock. The Series C Preferred Stock has a preference value of $152 million, pays cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% through November 2013 and 9% thereafter, and is held by the U.S. Department of Treasury (U.S. Treasury) under the Troubled Asset Relief Program  Capital Purchase Program.  

 The Provident transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Assets acquired totaled $6.3 billion, including $4.0 billion of loans and leases (including approximately $1.7 billion of commercial real estate loans, $1.4 billion of consumer loans, $700 million of commercial loans and leases and $300 million of residential real estate loans) and $1.0 billion of investment securities. Liabilities assumed were $5.9 billion, including $5.1 billion of deposits. The transaction added $436 million to M&Ts stockholders equity, including $280 million of common equity and $156 million of preferred equity. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded $332 million of goodwill and $63 million of core deposit intangible. The core deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years using an accelerated method. The acquisition of Provident expanded the Companys presence in the Mid-Atlantic area, gave the Company the second largest deposit share in Maryland, and tripled the Companys presence in Virginia.  

 Application of the acquisition method requires that acquired loans be recorded at fair value and prohibits the carry over of the acquired entitys allowance for credit losses. Determining the fair value of the acquired loans required estimating cash flows expected to be collected on the loans. The impact of estimated credit losses on all acquired loans was considered in the estimation of future cash flows used in the determination of estimated fair value as of the acquisition date.  

 Net acquisition and integration-related gains and expenses (included herein as merger-related expenses) associated with the Bradford and Provident acquisition transactions incurred during 2009 totaled $60 million ($36 million after tax effect, or $.31 of diluted earnings per common share). Reflected in that amount are a $29 million ($18 million after tax effect, or $.15 of diluted earnings per common share) gain on the Bradford transaction and $89 million ($54 million after tax effect, or $.46 of diluted earnings per common share) of expenses associated with the Provident and Bradford transactions. The gain reflects the amount of financial support and indemnification against loan losses that M&T obtained from the FDIC. The expenses were for professional services and other temporary help fees associated with the conversion of systems and/or integration of operations; costs related to branch and office consolidations; costs related to termination of existing Provident contractual arrangements for various services; initial marketing and promotion expenses designed to introduce M&T Bank to customers of Bradford    

 32   
 and Provident; severance for former employees of Provident; incentive compensation costs; travel costs; and printing, supplies and other costs of commencing operations in new markets and offices.  

 The condition of the residential real estate marketplace and the U.S. economy since 2007 has had a significant impact on the financial services industry as a whole, and specifically on the financial results of the Company. Beginning with a pronounced downturn in the residential real estate market in early 2007 that was led by problems in the sub-prime mortgage market, the deterioration of residential real estate values and higher delinquencies and charge-offs of loans continued throughout 2008 and 2009, including loans to builders and developers. With the U.S. economy in recession in 2008 and 2009, financial institutions were facing higher credit losses from distressed real estate values and borrower defaults, resulting in reduced capital levels. During 2009, the Company has experienced higher delinquencies and charge-offs related to its commercial loan and commercial real estate loan portfolios as well. Additionally, investment securities backed by residential and commercial real estate have reflected substantial unrealized losses due to a lack of liquidity in the financial markets and anticipated credit losses. Many financial institutions, including the Company, have taken charges for those unrealized losses that were deemed to be other than temporary.  

 In the third quarter of 2008, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC initiated measures to stabilize the financial markets and to provide liquidity for financial institutions. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) was signed into law on October 3, 2008 and authorized the U.S. Treasury to provide funds to be used to restore liquidity and stability to the U.S. financial system pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Under the authority of EESA, the U.S. Treasury instituted a voluntary capital purchase program under TARP to encourage U.S. financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy. Under the program, the U.S. Treasury purchased senior preferred shares of financial institutions which pay cumulative dividends at a rate of 5% per year for five years and thereafter at a rate of 9% per year. The terms of the senior preferred shares, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), provide that the shares may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at par value plus accrued and unpaid dividends upon approval of the U.S. Treasury and the participating financial institutions primary banking regulator. The senior preferred shares are non-voting and qualify as Tier 1 capital for regulatory reporting purposes. In connection with purchasing senior preferred shares, the U.S. Treasury also received warrants to purchase the common stock of participating financial institutions having a market price of 15% of the amount of senior preferred shares on the date of investment with an exercise price equal to the market price of the participating institutions common stock at the time of approval, calculated on a 20-trading day trailing average. The warrants have a term of ten years and are immediately exercisable, in whole or in part. For a period of three years, the consent of the U.S. Treasury will be required for participating institutions to increase their common stock dividend or repurchase their common stock, other than in connection with benefit plans consistent with past practice. Participation in the capital purchase program also includes certain restrictions on executive compensation that were modified by ARRA and further defined by the U.S. Treasury in its Interim Final Rule on TARP Standards for Compensation and Corporate Governance. The minimum subscription amount available to a participating institution was one percent of total risk-weighted assets. The maximum suggested subscription amount was three percent of risk-weighted assets. On December 23, 2008, M&T issued to the U.S. Treasury $600 million of Series A Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 1,218,522 shares of M&T common stock at $73.86 per share. M&T elected to participate in the capital purchase program at an amount equal to approximately 1% of its risk-weighted assets at the time. As already noted, Provident also participated in the capital purchase program. Preferred stock resulting from that participation was converted into $152 million of M&T Series C Preferred Stock and warrants to purchase 407,542 shares of M&T common stock at $55.76 per share. In total, M&T has $752 million of preferred stock outstanding related to the capital purchase program. Additional information regarding preferred stock of M&T is included in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 On November 30, 2007, M&T acquired Partners Trust Financial Group, Inc. (Partners Trust), a bank holding company headquartered in Utica, New York. Partners Trust Bank, the primary banking subsidiary of Partners Trust, was merged into M&T Bank on that date. Partners Trust Bank operated 33    

 33   
 branch offices in upstate New York at the date of acquisition. The results of operations acquired in the Partners Trust transaction have been included in the Companys financial results since November 30, 2007. After application of the election, allocation and proration procedures contained in the merger agreement with Partners Trust, M&T paid $282 million in cash and issued 3,096,861 shares of M&T common stock in exchange for Partners Trust shares outstanding at the time of acquisition. In addition, based on the merger agreement, M&T paid $9 million in cash to holders of outstanding and unexercised stock options granted by Partners Trust. The purchase price was approximately $559 million based on the cash paid to Partners Trust shareholders, the fair value of M&T common stock exchanged, and the cash paid to holders of Partners Trust stock options. The acquisition of Partners Trust expanded the Companys presence in upstate New York, making M&T Bank the deposit market share leader in the Utica-Rome and Binghamton markets, while strengthening its lead position in Syracuse.  

 Assets acquired from Partners Trust on November 30, 2007 totaled $3.5 billion, including $2.2 billion of loans and leases (largely residential real estate and consumer loans), liabilities assumed aggregated $3.0 billion, including $2.2 billion of deposits (largely savings, money-market and time deposits), and $277 million was added to stockholders equity. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded approximately $283 million of goodwill and $50 million of core deposit intangible. The core deposit intangible is being amortized over seven years using an accelerated method.  

 As a condition of the approval of the Partners Trust acquisition by regulators, M&T Bank was required to divest three of the acquired branch offices in Binghamton, New York. The three branches were sold on March 15, 2008, including loans of $13 million and deposits of $65 million. No gain or loss was recognized on that transaction.  

 On December 7, 2007, M&T Bank acquired the Mid-Atlantic retail banking franchise of First Horizon Bank (First Horizon), a subsidiary of First Horizon National Corporation, in a cash transaction, including $214 million of loans, $216 million of deposits and $80 million of trust and investment assets under management. In connection with the transaction, the Company recorded approximately $15 million of core deposit and other intangible assets that are being amortized using accelerated methods over a weighted-average life of seven years.  

 The Company incurred merger-related expenses associated with the Partners Trust and First Horizon transactions related to systems conversions and other costs of integrating and conforming acquired operations with and into the Company of approximately $15 million ($9 million net of applicable income taxes, or $.08 of diluted earnings per common share) during 2007 and $4 million ($2 million net of applicable income taxes, or $.02 of diluted earnings per common share) during 2008.  

 On February 5, 2007, M&T invested $300 million to acquire a 20 percent minority interest in Bayview Lending Group LLC (BLG), a privately-held commercial mortgage lender that specialized in originating, securitizing and servicing small balance commercial real estate loans. M&T recognizes income from BLG using the equity method of accounting. M&Ts pro-rata portion of the results of operations of BLG were losses of $26 million ($16 million after tax effect) in 2009 and $37 million ($23 million after tax effect) in 2008, and income of $9 million ($5 million after tax effect) in 2007, which have been recorded as a component of other income in the consolidated statement of income. Including expenses associated with M&Ts investment in BLG, most notably interest expense, that investment reduced the Companys net income in 2009, 2008 and 2007 by $24 million (after tax effect) or $.21 per diluted common share, $32 million (after tax effect) or $.29 per diluted common share, and $4 million (after tax effect) or $.04 per diluted common share, respectively.  

 Critical Accounting Estimates  

 The Companys significant accounting policies conform with GAAP and are described in note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements. In applying those accounting policies, management of the Company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, assumptions and estimates to be utilized. Certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the Companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances. Some of the more significant    

 34   
 areas in which management of the Company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following:  

       Allowance for credit losses  The allowance for credit losses represents the amount which, in managements judgment, will be adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. In estimating losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio, assumptions and judgment are applied to measure amounts and timing of expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations. Historical loss trends are also considered, as are economic conditions, industry trends, portfolio trends and borrower-specific financial data. Changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions, which may result in adjustment of the allowance. A detailed discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is included herein under the heading Provision for Credit Losses.   

       Valuation methodologies  Management of the Company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment, particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued. Quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets, such as trading assets, most investment securities, and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments. However, for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist, management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items. Examples of these items include loans, deposits, borrowings, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, and other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations; capitalized servicing assets; pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; value ascribed to stock-based compensation; estimated residual values of property associated with leases; and certain derivative and other financial instruments. These valuations require the use of various assumptions, including, among others, discount rates, rates of return on assets, repayment rates, cash flows, default rates, costs of servicing and liquidation values. The use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results, which could have material positive or negative effects on the Companys results of operations. In addition to valuation, the Company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that should be considered other than temporary or otherwise require an adjustment in carrying value and recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income. Examples include investment securities, other investments, mortgage servicing rights, goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets, among others. Specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, 12, 18, 19 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.   

       Commitments, contingencies and off-balance sheet arrangements  Information regarding the Companys commitments and contingencies, including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation, and their potential effects on the Companys results of operations is included in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. Information regarding the Companys income taxes is presented in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements. The recognition or de-recognition in the Companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by so-called variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the probability of financial outcomes in future periods and the degree to which the Company can influence those      

 35   
      outcomes. Information relating to the Companys involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.    

 Overview  

 Net income for the Company during 2009 was $380 million or $2.89 of diluted earnings per common share, representing declines of 32% and 42%, respectively, from $556 million or $5.01 of diluted earnings per common share in 2008. Basic earnings per common share decreased 42% to $2.90 in 2009 from $5.04 in 2008. Net income in 2007 aggregated $654 million, while diluted and basic earnings per common share were $5.95 and $6.05, respectively. The after-tax impact of net merger-related gains and expenses associated with the 2009 and 2007 acquisition transactions previously described were $36 million ($60 million pre-tax) or $.31 of basic and diluted earnings per common share in 2009, $2 million ($4 million pre-tax) or $.02 of basic and diluted earnings per common share in 2008 and $9 million ($15 million pre-tax) or $.08 of basic and diluted earnings per common share in 2007. Net income expressed as a rate of return on average assets in 2009 was .56%, compared with .85% in 2008 and 1.12% in 2007. The return on average common stockholders equity was 5.07% in 2009, 8.64% in 2008 and 10.47% in 2007.  

 Several noteworthy items are reflected in the Companys financial results in 2009. The provision for credit losses and net loan charge-offs during 2009 were at higher than historical levels, due largely to the recessionary state of the U.S. economy and its impact on consumers and businesses, and the continuation of a distressed residential real estate market. The provision for credit losses in 2009 was $604 million, up from $412 million in 2008. Net charge-offs during 2009 aggregated $514 million, compared with $383 million in 2008. As a percentage of average loans outstanding, net charge-offs were 1.01% and .78% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Charge-offs in all major loan categories rose from 2008 to 2009. The most dramatic increase in net charge-offs was related to commercial loans, which rose to $172 million in 2009 from $94 million in 2008. That increase was largely driven by a small number of significant commercial loan charge-offs. In addition, charge-offs of residential real estate loans rose to $92 million in 2009 from $63 million in 2008, reflecting the turbulence in the residential real estate market place which has resulted in deteriorating real estate values and increased delinquencies. The Company also continued to incur elevated costs related to the workout process for modifying residential mortgage loans of creditworthy borrowers and to the foreclosure process for borrowers unable to make payments on their loans.  

 During 2009, $84 million of after-tax other-than-temporary impairment charges ($138 million before taxes) were recorded on certain available-for-sale investment securities, reducing basic and diluted earnings per common share by $.73. Specifically, such charges related to certain privately issued collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) backed by residential real estate loans and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The Company also experienced substantially higher costs related to deposit assessments by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Such costs rose to $97 million in 2009 from $7 million in 2008 and reflected higher assessment rates, expirations of available credits and a $33 million second quarter 2009 special assessment levied by the FDIC on insured financial institutions to rebuild the Deposit Insurance Fund. That special assessment reduced net income and diluted earnings per common share by $20 million and $.17, respectively.  

 The Companys financial results for 2008 were also affected by several notable factors. Largely the result of the state of the U.S. economy and the distressed residential real estate marketplace, the Companys provision for credit losses in 2008 was $412 million, significantly higher than $192 million in 2007. Net charge-offs of loans rose dramatically in 2008, to $383 million from $114 million in 2007. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were .78% and .26% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. While charge-offs were up in all major categories of loans, the most significant contributors to the sharp rise were loan charge-offs related to residential real estate markets; charge-offs of loans to builders and developers of residential real estate jumped from $4 million in 2007 to $100 million in 2008, and residential real estate loan charge-offs grew to $63 million in 2008 from $19 million in 2007. Not only did the condition of the residential real estate markets negatively impact the Companys financial results in 2008 through a higher provision for credit losses, but significantly higher costs were    

 36   
 incurred related to the workout process for modifying residential mortgage loans and to the foreclosure process.  

 During the third quarter of 2008, a $153 million (pre-tax) other-than-temporary impairment charge was recorded related to preferred stock issuances of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The write-down was taken on preferred stock with a basis of $162 million following the U.S. Governments placement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship on September 7, 2008. The Company recognized additional other-than-temporary impairment charges during 2008 totaling $29 million (pre-tax) related to certain CDOs (obtained from Partners Trust) and CMOs. In total, other-than-temporary impairment charges on investment securities aggregated $182 million ($111 million after tax effect) during 2008, thereby lowering diluted earnings per common share by $1.00.  

 Also reflected in the Companys 2008 results was $29 million of after-tax income, or $.26 of diluted earnings per common share, resulting from M&T Banks status as a member bank of Visa. During the last quarter of 2007, Visa completed a reorganization in contemplation of its initial public offering (IPO) in 2008. As part of that reorganization M&T Bank and other member banks of Visa received shares of Class B common stock of Visa. M&T Bank was allocated 1,967,028 Class B common shares of Visa based on its proportionate ownership of Visa. Of those shares, 760,455 were mandatorily redeemed in March 2008 for an after-tax gain of $20 million ($33 million pre-tax), which has been recorded as gain on bank investment securities in the consolidated statement of income, adding $.18 to diluted earnings per common share. Those member banks are also obligated under various agreements with Visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation involving Visa (Covered Litigation). As of December 31, 2007, although Visa was expected to set aside a portion of the proceeds from its IPO in an escrow account to fund any judgments or settlements that may arise out of the Covered Litigation, guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated that Visa member banks should record a liability for the fair value of the contingent obligation to Visa. The estimation of the Companys proportionate share of any potential losses related to the Covered Litigation was extremely difficult and involved a great deal of judgment. Nevertheless, in the fourth quarter of 2007 the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $23 million ($14 million after tax effect, or $.13 per diluted common share) related to the Covered Litigation. In accordance with GAAP and consistent with the SEC guidance, the Company did not recognize any value for its common stock ownership interest in Visa as of the 2007 year-end. During the first quarter of 2008, Visa completed its IPO and, as part of the transaction, funded an escrow account with $3 billion from the proceeds of the IPO to cover potential settlements arising out of the Covered Litigation. As a result, during the first three months of 2008, the Company reversed approximately $15 million of the $23 million accrued during the fourth quarter of 2007 for the Covered Litigation, adding $9 million to net income ($.08 per diluted common share). Subsequently, Visa has announced that it had further funded the escrow account to provide for the settlement of Covered Litigation. Those subsequent fundings did not result in a material impact to the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations as of or for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008.  

 The Company resolved certain tax issues during the third quarter of 2008 related to its activities in various jurisdictions during the years 1999-2007. As a result, the Company paid $40 million to settle those issues, but was able to reduce previously accrued income tax expense in 2008 by $40 million, thereby adding $.36 to that years diluted earnings per common share.  

 The Companys financial results for 2007 were also adversely impacted by several events. Turmoil in the residential real estate market, which began in early 2007, significantly affected the Companys financial results in a number of ways. Problems experienced by lenders in the sub-prime residential mortgage lending market also had negative repercussions on the rest of the residential real estate marketplace. Through early 2007, the Company had been an active participant in the origination of alternative (Alt-A) residential real estate loans and the sale of such loans in the secondary market. Alt-A loans originated by M&T typically included some form of limited documentation requirements as compared with more traditional residential real estate loans. Unfavorable market conditions during the first quarter of 2007, including a lack of liquidity, impacted the Companys willingness to sell Alt-A loans, as an auction of such loans initiated by the Company received fewer bids than normal and the pricing of those bids was substantially lower than expected. As a result, $883 million of Alt-A loans previously held for sale (including $808 million of first mortgage loans and $75 million of second mortgage loans) were transferred in March 2007 to the    

 37   
 Companys held-for-investment loan portfolio. In accordance with GAAP, loans held for sale must be recorded at the lower of cost or market value. Accordingly, prior to reclassifying the Alt-A mortgage loans to the held-for-investment portfolio, the carrying value of such loans was reduced by $12 million ($7 million after tax effect, or $.07 of diluted earnings per common share). Those loans were reclassified because management believed at that time that the value of the Alt-A residential real estate loans was greater than the amount implied by the few bidders who were then active in the market. The downturn in the residential real estate market, specifically related to declining real estate valuations and higher delinquencies, continued throughout the remainder of 2007 and had a negative effect on the majority of financial institutions active in residential real estate lending. As a result of retaining those Alt-A residential real estate loans, the Company experienced higher loan charge-offs during 2007-2009.  

 The turbulence in the residential real estate market in 2007 also negatively affected three CDOs purchased in the first quarter of 2007 for approximately $132 million. Although these securities were highly rated when purchased, two of the three securities were downgraded by the rating agencies in late-2007. After a thorough analysis, management concluded that the impairment of the market value of these securities was other than temporary. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $127 million ($78 million after tax effect, or $.71 of diluted earnings per common share) in the fourth quarter of 2007.  

 Finally, as already noted, during the last quarter of 2007, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $23 million ($14 million after tax effect, or $.13 per diluted common share) related to the Visa Covered Litigation.  

 Taxable-equivalent net interest income of $2.08 billion in 2009 was 6% higher than $1.96 billion in 2008. Contributing to the improvement were growth in average earning assets and a widening of the Companys net interest margin, or taxable-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. Average earning assets rose 3% to $59.6 billion in 2009 from $58.0 billion in 2008, largely due to the $5.5 billion of earning assets obtained in the Provident and Bradford transactions. Average loans and leases totaled $51.0 billion in 2009, up 4% from $48.8 billion in 2008. Loans obtained in the 2009 acquisition transactions were $4.3 billion at the respective acquisition dates. Exclusive of acquired loans, average loans outstanding during 2009 declined slightly less than 1% from 2008. The net interest margin widened 11 basis points (hundredths of one percent) to 3.49% in 2009 from 3.38% in 2008, largely due to lower interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  

 Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis in 2008 rose 5% from $1.87 billion in 2007. The positive impact of higher average earning assets was partially offset by a decline in net interest margin. Average earning assets increased 12% to $58.0 billion in 2008 from $52.0 billion in 2007, the result of increased average balances of loans and leases and investment securities. Earning assets obtained in the fourth quarter 2007 acquisition transactions were $3.3 billion. Average loans and leases of $48.8 billion in 2008 were $4.7 billion or 11% higher than $44.1 billion in 2007, due to growth in commercial loans and leases of $1.6 billion, or 13%, commercial real estate loans of $2.7 billion, or 17%, and consumer loans and leases of $961 million, or 9%, partially offset by a $550 million, or 9%, decline in residential real estate loans. Reflected in those amounts were loans obtained in the 2007 acquisition transactions aggregating $2.4 billion at the respective acquisition dates, including $259 million of commercial loans and leases, $343 million of commercial real estate loans, $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans and $690 million of consumer loans. Of the $1.1 billion of residential real estate loans acquired, approximately $950 million were securitized into Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities in December 2007. The acquired loans did not have a significant impact on average loans and leases for 2007. Average balances of investment securities increased 23% to $9.0 billion in 2008 from $7.3 billion in 2007. The net interest margin declined 22 basis points to 3.38% in 2008 from 3.60% in 2007, due to a decrease in the contribution ascribed to net interest-free funds that resulted largely from the impact of lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value such funds.  

 The provision for credit losses rose to $604 million in 2009 from $412 million in 2008 and $192 million in 2007. Deteriorating credit conditions that were reflected in rising levels of charge-offs and delinquencies, as well as rapidly declining residential real estate valuations during 2007 and continuing in 2008 and 2009 and their impact on the Companys portfolios of residential mortgage loans and loans to residential builders and developers, contributed significantly to the increases in the    

 38   
 provision. Also contributing to the higher levels of the provision, charge-offs and delinquencies in 2008 and 2009 was the impact of the condition of the U.S. economy, which was in recession. The Company experienced higher levels of commercial loan charge-offs during 2009 as the economic conditions directly impacted the financial condition of certain businesses. Net charge-offs of all loan types were $514 million in 2009, up from $383 million in 2008 and $114 million in 2007. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding rose to 1.01% in 2009 from .78% in 2008 and .26% in 2007. The provision in each year represents the result of managements analysis of the composition of the loan and lease portfolio and other factors, including concern regarding uncertainty about economic conditions, both nationally and in many of the markets served by the Company, and the impact of such conditions and prospects on the abilities of borrowers to repay loans.  

 Noninterest income in 2009 totaled $1.05 billion, up 12% from $939 million in 2008. Gains and losses on bank investment securities (including other-than-temporary impairment losses) totaled to net losses of $137 million in 2009 and $148 million in 2008. Those losses were due to other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain of M&Ts privately issued CMOs, CDOs and in 2008, preferred stock holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. The 2008 losses are net of the already noted $33 million gain from the sale of shares of Visa. Excluding gains and losses from bank investment securities and the $29 million gain recorded on the Bradford transaction, other income was $1.16 billion in 2009, 6% higher than $1.09 billion in 2008. Contributing to that improvement were higher mortgage banking revenues and service charges on acquisition-related deposit accounts, partially offset by declines in trust and brokerage services income.  

 Noninterest income in 2008 was $6 million higher than $933 million in 2007. Reflected in 2007s total were $126 million of losses from bank investment securities. Those losses were due predominately to other-than-temporary impairment charges related to certain of M&Ts CDOs held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Excluding the impact of net securities losses, noninterest income of $1.09 billion in 2008 was 3% higher than $1.06 billion in 2007. That rise reflected higher mortgage banking revenues and fees for providing deposit services that were partially offset by a $46 million decline in M&Ts pro-rata portion of the operating results of BLG.  

 Noninterest expense in 2009 totaled $1.98 billion, up 15% from $1.73 billion in 2008. Noninterest expense in 2007 was $1.63 billion. Included in such amounts are expenses considered by M&T to be nonoperating in nature, consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $64 million, $67 million and $66 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and merger-related expenses of $89 million in 2009, $4 million in 2008 and $15 million in 2007. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses aggregated $1.83 billion in 2009, $1.66 billion in 2008 and $1.55 billion in 2007. The most significant factors for the higher level of noninterest operating expenses in 2009 as compared with 2008 were a $90 million rise in FDIC deposit assessments, costs associated with the acquired operations of Provident and Bradford, and higher foreclosure-related expenses. Partially offsetting those increases was a partial reversal of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $22 million in 2009, compared with an addition to the valuation allowance of $16 million in 2008. Contributing to the rise in operating expenses from 2007 to 2008 were higher expenses for salaries, occupancy, professional services, advertising and promotion, and foreclosed residential real estate properties. Partially offsetting those factors was the $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to M&T Banks obligation as a member bank of Visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation, compared with a partial reversal of that charge in the first quarter of 2008 of $15 million. Included in operating expenses in 2009 were $12 million of tax-deductible contributions made to The M&T Charitable Foundation, a tax-exempt private charitable foundation. Similar contributions of $6 million were made in 2008, whereas no such contributions were made in 2007.  

 The efficiency ratio expresses the relationship of operating expenses to revenues. The Companys efficiency ratio, or noninterest operating expenses (as previously defined) divided by the sum of taxable-equivalent net interest income and noninterest income (exclusive of gains and losses from bank investment securities and gains on merger transactions), was 56.5% in 2009, compared with 54.4% in 2008 and 52.8% in 2007.

 Supplemental Reporting of Non-GAAP Results of Operations  

 As a result of business combinations and other acquisitions, the Company had intangible assets consisting of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets totaling $3.7 billion at December 31, 2009 and $3.4 billion at each of December 31, 2008 and 2007. Included in such intangible assets was goodwill of $3.5 billion at December 31, 2009 and $3.2 billion at each of December 31, 2008 and 2007. Amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets, after tax effect, totaled $39 million, $41 million and $40 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 M&T consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis, from which M&T excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts) and gains and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into the Company, since such items are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature. Although net operating income as defined by M&T is not a GAAP measure, M&Ts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results.  

 Net operating income totaled $455 million in 2009, compared with $599 million in 2008. Diluted net operating earnings per common share in 2009 declined 34% to $3.54 from $5.39 in 2008. Net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share were $704 million and $6.40, respectively, during 2007.  

 Net operating income expressed as a rate of return on average tangible assets was .71% in 2009, compared with .97% in 2008 and 1.27% in 2007. Net operating return on average tangible common equity was 13.42% in 2009, compared with 19.63% and 22.58% in 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 Reconciliations of GAAP amounts with corresponding non-GAAP amounts are presented in table 2.

 Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities  

 Net interest income expressed on a taxable-equivalent basis aggregated $2.08 billion in 2009, up 6% from $1.96 billion in 2008, the result of growth in average earning assets and a widening of the Companys net interest margin. Average earning assets totaled $59.6 billion in 2009, up 3% from $58.0 billion in 2008. Growth in average loan and lease balances outstanding, which rose 4% to $51.0 billion in 2009 from $48.8 billion in 2008, was partially offset by a decline in average investment securities, which decreased 6% to $8.4 billion in 2009 from $9.0 billion in 2008. The growth in average loans in 2009 was predominantly the result of loans obtained in the Provident and Bradford transactions. The improvement in the net interest margin, which widened 11 basis points to 3.49% in 2009 from 3.38% in 2008, was largely the result of lower interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  

 Average loan and lease balances outstanding increased to $51.0 billion in 2009 from $48.8 billion in 2008. That growth was predominantly the result of loans acquired in the Provident and Bradford transactions of $4.0 billion on May 23, 2009 and $302 million on August 28, 2009, respectively. In total, the acquired loans consisted of approximately $700 million of commercial loans, $1.8 billion of commercial real estate loans, $400 million of residential real estate loans and $1.4 billion of consumer loans. Including the impact of acquired loan balances, commercial loans and leases averaged $13.9 billion in 2009, up slightly from $13.8 billion in 2008; average commercial real estate loans increased 9% to $20.1 billion in 2009 from $18.4 billion in 2008; average residential real estate loans declined 3% to $5.3 billion in 2009 from $5.5 billion in 2008; and consumer loans averaged $11.7 billion in 2009, 5% higher than $11.2 billion in 2008.  

 Reflecting growth in average earning assets that was partially offset by a narrowing of the net interest margin, taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 5% to $1.96 billion in 2008 from $1.87 billion in 2007. Average earning assets increased $6.0 billion or 12% to $58.0 billion in 2008 from $52.0 billion in 2007. That growth resulted from a $4.7 billion or 11% increase in average outstanding balances of loans and leases and a $1.7 billion or 23% rise in average outstanding balances of investment securities. The Companys net interest margin declined to 3.38% in 2008 from 3.60% in 2007.

 Average loans and leases increased to $48.8 billion in 2008 from $44.1 billion in 2007. Most of the Companys major loan categories experienced growth during 2008. Average commercial loans and leases increased 13% to $13.8 billion in 2008 from $12.2 billion in 2007. Commercial real estate loans averaged $18.4 billion in 2008, up 17% from $15.7 billion in 2007. The Companys consumer loan portfolio averaged $11.2 billion in 2008, 9% higher than $10.2 billion in 2007. Average residential real estate loans declined 9% to $5.5 billion in 2008 from $6.0 billion in 2007, due largely to a $533 million decrease in average loans held for sale to $591 million in 2008 from $1.1 billion in 2007.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Commercial loans and leases, excluding loans secured by real estate, aggregated $13.5 billion at December 31, 2009, representing 26% of total loans and leases. Table 5 presents information on commercial loans and leases as of December 31, 2009 relating to geographic area, size, borrower industry and whether the loans are secured by collateral or unsecured. Of the $13.5 billion of commercial loans and leases outstanding at the end of 2009, approximately $11.1 billion, or 82%, were secured, while 48%, 23% and 19% were granted to businesses in New York State, Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area (which includes Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia), respectively. The Company provides financing for leases to commercial customers, primarily for equipment. Commercial leases included in total commercial loans and leases at December 31, 2009 aggregated $1.6 billion, of which 42% were secured by collateral located in New York State, 16% were secured by collateral in the Mid-Atlantic area and another 10% were secured by collateral in Pennsylvania.

 International loans included in commercial loans and leases totaled $55 million and $91 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Company participates in the insurance and guarantee programs of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. These programs provide U.S. government repayment coverage of 90% to 100% on loans supporting foreign borrowers purchases of U.S. goods and services and coverage of 90% on loans to U.S. exporters of goods and services to foreign buyers. The loans generally range up to $10 million. The outstanding balances of loans under these programs at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $43 million and $76 million, respectively.  

 Loans secured by real estate, including outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit which the Company classifies as consumer loans, represented approximately 62% of the loan and lease portfolio during 2009, compared with 60% in 2008 and 61% in 2007. At December 31, 2009, the Company held approximately $20.9 billion of commercial real estate loans, $5.5 billion of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties (including $530 million of loans held for sale) and $6.8 billion of outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit, compared with $18.8 billion, $4.9 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Loans obtained in the 2009 Provident and Bradford acquisition transactions included $1.8 billion of commercial real estate loans, $400 million of consumer real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential mortgages and $1.1 billion of outstanding home equity loans and lines of credit. Included in total loans and leases were amounts due from builders and developers of residential real estate aggregating $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, of which $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, were classified as commercial real estate loans.  

 A significant portion of commercial real estate loans originated by the Company are secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area, including areas in neighboring states generally considered to be within commuting distance of New York City, and other areas of New York State where the Company operates. Commercial real estate loans are also originated through the Companys offices in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., Oregon, West Virginia and other states. Commercial real estate loans originated by the Company include fixed-rate instruments with monthly payments and a balloon payment of the remaining unpaid principal at maturity, in many cases five years after origination. For borrowers in good standing, the terms of such loans may be extended by the customer for an additional five years at the then current market rate of interest. The Company also originates fixed-rate commercial real estate loans with maturities of greater than five years, generally having original maturity terms of approximately seven to ten years, and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans. Excluding construction and development loans made to investors, adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans represented approximately 46% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2009. Table 6 presents commercial real estate loans by geographic area, type of collateral and size of the loans outstanding at December 31, 2009. New York City metropolitan area commercial real estate loans totaled $7.1 billion at the 2009 year-end. The $6.0 billion of investor-owned commercial real estate loans in the New York City metropolitan area were largely secured by multifamily residential properties, retail space, and office space. The Companys experience has been that office, retail and service-related properties tend to demonstrate more volatile fluctuations in value through economic cycles and changing economic conditions than do multifamily residential properties. Approximately 49% of the aggregate dollar amount of New York City-area loans were for loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less, while loans of more than $50 million made up approximately 15% of the total.

 Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located in other parts of New York State, Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area tend to have a greater diversity of collateral types and include a significant amount of lending to customers who use the mortgaged property in their trade or business (owner-occupied). Approximately 82% of the aggregate dollar amount of commercial real estate loans in New York State secured by properties located outside of the metropolitan New York City area were for loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less. Of the outstanding balances of commercial real    

 47   
 estate loans in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area, approximately 74% and 67%, respectively, were for loans with outstanding balances of $10 million or less.  

 Commercial real estate loans secured by properties located outside of Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area, New York State and areas of states neighboring New York considered to be part of the New York City metropolitan area, comprised 7% of total commercial real estate loans as of December 31, 2009.  

 Commercial real estate construction and development loans made to investors presented in table 6 totaled $4.4 billion at December 31, 2009, or 8% of total loans and leases. Approximately 78% of those construction loans had adjustable interest rates. Included in such loans at December 31, 2009 were $1.6 billion of loans to developers of residential real estate properties. Information about the credit performance of the Companys loans to builders and developers of residential real estate properties is included herein under the heading Provision For Credit Losses. The remainder of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio was comprised of loans made for various purposes, including the construction of office buildings, multifamily residential housing, retail space and other commercial development.  

 M&T Realty Capital Corporation, a commercial real estate lending subsidiary of M&T Bank, participates in the Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program, pursuant to which commercial real estate loans are originated in accordance with terms and conditions specified by Fannie Mae and sold. Under this program, loans are sold with partial credit recourse to M&T Realty Capital Corporation. The amount of recourse is generally limited to one-third of any credit loss incurred by the purchaser on an individual loan, although in some cases the recourse amount is less than one-third of the outstanding principal balance. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of commercial real estate loan balances serviced for others had been sold with recourse. There have been no material losses incurred as a result of those recourse arrangements. Commercial real estate loans held for sale at December 31, 2009 and 2008 aggregated $123 million and $156 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, commercial real estate loans serviced for other investors by the Company were $7.1 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively. Those serviced loans are not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet.  

 Real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties were $5.5 billion at December 31, 2009, including approximately 36% secured by properties located in New York State, 12% secured by properties located in Pennsylvania and 21% secured by properties located in the Mid-Atlantic area. At December 31, 2009, $530 million of residential real estate loans were held for sale, compared with $352 million at December 31, 2008. The Companys portfolio of Alt-A loans held for investment at December 31, 2009 totaled $789 million, compared with $974 million at December 31, 2008. Loans to individuals to finance the construction of one-to-four family residential properties totaled $76 million at December 31, 2009, or approximately .1% of total loans and leases, compared with $233 million or .5% at December 31, 2008. Information about the credit performance of the Companys Alt-A mortgage loans and other residential mortgage loans is included herein under the heading Provision For Credit Losses.  

 Consumer loans comprised approximately 23% of the average loan portfolio during each of 2009 and 2008. The two largest components of the consumer loan portfolio are outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit and automobile loans. Average balances of home equity lines of credit outstanding represented approximately 11% and 9% of average loans outstanding in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Automobile loans represented approximately 6% and 7% of the Companys average loan portfolio during 2009 and 2008, respectively. No other consumer loan product represented more than 4% of average loans outstanding in 2009. Approximately 44% of home equity lines of credit outstanding at December 31, 2009 were secured by properties in New York State, and 19% and 35% were secured by properties in Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area, respectively. Average outstanding balances on home equity lines of credit were approximately $5.4 billion and $4.5 billion in 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2009, 34% and 24% of the automobile loan portfolio were to customers residing in New York State and Pennsylvania, respectively. Although automobile loans have generally been originated through dealers, all applications submitted through dealers are subject to the Companys normal underwriting and loan approval procedures. Outstanding automobile loan balances declined to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2009 from $3.3 billion at December 31, 2008.   

 48   
 Table 7 presents the composition of the Companys loan and lease portfolio at the end of 2009, including outstanding balances to businesses and consumers in New York State, Pennsylvania, the Mid-Atlantic area and other states. Approximately 47% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2009 were to New York State customers, while 18% and 23% were to Pennsylvania and the Mid-Atlantic area customers, respectively.

 Balances of investment securities averaged $8.4 billion in 2009, compared with $9.0 billion and $7.3 billion in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decline in average investment securities balances during 2009 as compared with 2008 largely reflects paydowns of mortgage-backed securities, partially offset by the investment securities obtained in the Provident transaction and the impact of a first quarter 2009 residential real estate loan securitization. The Company securitized approximately $141 million of residential real estate loans in a guaranteed mortgage securitization with Fannie Mae. The increase of $1.7 billion or 23% from 2007 to 2008 was largely due to the impact of residential real estate loan securitizations in June and July of 2008 and in December 2007 and to the full-year impact of third quarter 2007 purchases of approximately $800 million of collateralized mortgage obligations and other mortgage-backed securities. During June and July 2008, the Company securitized approximately $875 million of residential real estate loans in guaranteed mortgage securitizations with Fannie Mae. During December 2007, approximately $950 million of residential real estate loans obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition were securitized in a guaranteed mortgage securitization with Fannie Mae. The Company recognized no gain or loss on those securitization transactions as it retained all of the resulting securities, which are held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio.   

 49   
 The investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgage-backed securities and CMOs, debt securities issued by municipalities, debt and preferred equity securities issued by government-sponsored agencies and certain financial institutions, and shorter-term U.S. Treasury and federal agency notes. When purchasing investment securities, the Company considers its overall interest-rate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed, including prepayments. In managing the investment securities portfolio, the Company occasionally sells investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads, actual or anticipated prepayments, credit risk associated with a particular security, or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio following completion of a business combination.  

 During the third quarter of 2008, the Company purchased a $142 million AAA-rated private placement mortgage-backed security that had been securitized by Bayview Financial Holdings, L.P. (together with its affiliates, Bayview Financial). Bayview Financial is a privately-held company and is the majority investor of BLG. Upon purchase, the security was placed in the Companys held-to-maturity portfolio, as management determined that it had the intent and ability to hold the security to maturity. Management subsequently reconsidered whether certain other similar mortgage-backed securities previously purchased from Bayview Financial and held in the Companys available-for-sale portfolio should more appropriately be in the held-to-maturity portfolio. Concluding that it had the intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity as well, the Company transferred CMOs having a fair value of $298 million and a cost basis of $385 million from its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio to the held-to-maturity portfolio during the third quarter of 2008.  

 The Company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be characterized as other than temporary. As previously discussed, other-than-temporary impairment charges of $138 million (pre-tax) were recognized during 2009 related to certain privately issued CMOs and CDOs held in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Specifically, $130 million of such impairment charges related to privately issued CMOs and CDOs backed by residential real estate loans and $8 million related to CDOs backed by trust preferred securities of financial institutions. During the third quarter of 2008 the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $153 million related to its holdings of preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Additional other-than-temporary impairment charges of $29 million were recognized in 2008 on CMOs backed by option adjustable rate residential mortgage loans (ARMs) and CDOs backed by trust preferred securities of financial institutions. Poor economic conditions, high unemployment and depressed real estate values are significant factors contributing to the recognition of the other-than-temporary impairment charges. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company concluded that the remaining declines associated with the rest of the investment securities portfolio were temporary in nature. That conclusion was based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of each respective date. A further discussion of fair values of investment securities is included herein under the heading Capital. Additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes 3 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Other earning assets include deposits at banks, trading account assets, federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities. Those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged $189 million in 2009, $198 million in 2008 and $503 million in 2007. Reflected in those balances were purchases of investment securities under agreements to resell, which averaged $41 million, $96 million and $417 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The higher level of resell agreements in 2007 as compared with 2008 and 2009 was due, in part, to the need to collateralize deposits of municipalities. The amounts of investment securities and other earning assets held by the Company are influenced by such factors as demand for loans, which generally yield more than investment securities and other earning assets, ongoing repayments, the levels of deposits, and management of balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios.  

 The most significant source of funding for the Company is core deposits, which are comprised of noninterest-bearing deposits, nonbrokered interest-bearing transaction accounts, nonbrokered savings deposits and nonbrokered domestic time deposits under $100,000. The Companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits, which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities. Certificates of deposit under $100,000 generated on a nationwide basis by M&T    

 50   
 Bank, N.A. are also included in core deposits. Core deposits averaged $39.1 billion in 2009, up from $31.7 billion in 2008 and $28.6 billion in 2007. The acquisition transactions in 2009 added $3.8 billion of core deposits on the respective acquisition dates, while the late-2007 acquisition transactions added $2.0 billion of core deposits on the respective acquisition dates. Average core deposits of M&T Bank, N.A. were $337 million in 2009, $274 million in 2008 and $208 million in 2007. Excluding deposits obtained in the acquisition transactions, the growth in core deposits from 2008 to 2009 was due, in part, to the impact on the attractiveness of alternative investments to the Companys customers resulting from lower interest rates and the recessionary environment in the U.S. The continuing low interest rate environment has resulted in a shift in customer savings trends, as average time deposits have continued to decline, while average noninterest-bearing deposits and savings deposits have increased. Funding provided by core deposits represented 66% of average earning assets in 2009, up significantly from 55% in each of 2008 and 2007. Core deposits totaled $43.1 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with $34.3 billion at December 31, 2008. Table 8 summarizes average core deposits in 2009 and percentage changes in the components of such deposits over the past two years.  

 Table 8  

 AVERAGE CORE DEPOSITS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Domestic time deposits of $100,000 or more, deposits originated through the Companys offshore branch office, and brokered deposits provide additional funding sources for the Company. Domestic time deposits over $100,000, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, averaged $2.6 billion in each of 2009 and 2008, and $2.7 billion in 2007. Offshore branch deposits, primarily comprised of accounts with balances of $100,000 or more, averaged $1.7 billion in 2009, $4.0 billion in 2008 and $4.2 billion in 2007. Average brokered time deposits totaled $822 million in 2009, compared with $1.4 billion in 2008 and $2.1 billion in 2007, and at December 31, 2009 and 2008 totaled $868 million and $487 million, respectively. Reflected in average brokered time deposits in 2009 were deposits obtained in the acquisition of Provident, which added approximately $601 million to the average 2009 total. In connection with the Companys management of interest rate risk, interest rate swap agreements have been entered into under which the Company receives a fixed rate of interest and pays a variable rate and that have notional amounts and terms substantially similar to the amounts and terms of $25 million of brokered time deposits. The Company also had brokered NOW and brokered money-market deposit accounts, which in the aggregate averaged $757 million, $218 million and $87 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The significant increase in such average brokered deposit balances in 2009 as compared with 2008 and 2007 was the result of demand for such deposits, largely resulting from the uncertain economic markets and the desire of brokerage firms to earn reasonable yields while ensuring that customer deposits were fully insured. Offshore branch deposits and brokered deposits have been used by the Company as alternatives to short-term borrowings. Additional amounts of offshore branch deposits or brokered deposits may be added in the future depending on market conditions, including demand by customers and other investors for those deposits, and the cost of funds available from alternative sources at the time.  

 The Company also uses borrowings from banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs), the Federal Reserve and others as sources of funding. Short-term borrowings averaged    

 51   
 $2.9 billion in 2009, $6.1 billion in 2008 and $5.4 billion in 2007. Included in short-term borrowings were unsecured federal funds borrowings, which generally mature on the next business day, that averaged $1.8 billion, $4.5 billion and $4.6 billion in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Overnight federal funds borrowings represented the largest component of average short-term borrowings and were obtained from a wide variety of banks and other financial institutions. Overnight federal funds borrowings totaled $2.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and $809 million at December 31, 2008. Average short-term borrowings during 2009, 2008 and 2007 included $688 million, $682 million and $160 million, respectively, of borrowings from the FHLB of New York and the FHLB of Atlanta. Also included in average short-term borrowings in 2009 and 2008 were secured borrowings with the Federal Reserve through their Term Auction Facility (TAF). Borrowings under the TAF averaged $268 million and $238 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings under the TAF at December 31, 2009, while at December 31, 2008 $1.0 billion were outstanding. Also included in average short-term borrowings in 2007 and 2008 was a $500 million revolving asset-backed structured borrowing secured by automobile loans that was paid off during late-2008. All of the available amount of that structured borrowing was in use at the 2007 year-end. The average balance of this borrowing was $463 million in 2008 and $437 million in 2007.  

 Long-term borrowings averaged $11.1 billion in 2009, $11.6 billion in 2008 and $8.4 billion in 2007. Included in average long-term borrowings were amounts borrowed from the FHLBs of $6.1 billion in 2009, $6.7 billion in 2008 and $4.3 billion in 2007, and subordinated capital notes of $1.9 billion in each of 2009 and 2008, and $1.6 billion in 2007. The Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of long-term debt. Those swap agreements are used to hedge approximately $1.0 billion of fixed rate subordinated notes. Further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. Junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average long-term borrowings were $1.1 billion in each of 2009 and 2008, and $716 million in 2007. Additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures, as well as information regarding contractual maturities of long-term borrowings, is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. Also included in long-term borrowings were agreements to repurchase securities, which averaged $1.6 billion during 2009, 2008 and 2007. The agreements, which were entered into due to favorable rates available, have various repurchase dates through 2017, however, the contractual maturities of the underlying securities extend beyond such repurchase dates.  

 Changes in the composition of the Companys earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities as described herein, as well as changes in interest rates and spreads, can impact net interest income. Net interest spread, or the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.21% in 2009, compared with 3.01% in 2008. The yield on the Companys earning assets during 2009 was 4.61%, down 108 basis points from 5.69% in 2008, while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities declined 128 basis points to 1.40% in 2009 from 2.68% in 2008. The yield on earning assets of 5.69% during 2008 was 117 basis points lower than 6.86% in 2007, while the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities also decreased 117 basis points to 2.68% from 3.85% in 2007. The lower interest rates in 2009 as compared with 2008 and in 2008 as compared with 2007 reflect the impact of the recessionary economy and the Federal Reserves monetary policies on both short-term and long-term interest rates. In addition, the Federal Open Market Committee noted in January 2010 that low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations were likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period of time. During 2008, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark overnight federal funds target rate seven times representing decreases of 400 basis points for the year, such that, at December 31, 2008 and 2009, the Federal Reserves target rate for overnight federal funds was expressed as a range from 0% to .25%. Additionally, in the last four months of 2007, the Federal Reserve lowered its federal funds target rate three times totaling 100 basis points.  

 Net interest-free funds consist largely of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and stockholders equity, partially offset by bank owned life insurance and non-earning assets, including goodwill, core deposit and other intangible assets. Net interest-free funds averaged $11.7 billion in 2009, compared with $8.1 billion in 2008 and $7.9 billion in 2007. The significant increase in average net interest-free funds in    

 52   
 2009 was largely the result of higher average balances of noninterest-bearing deposits, which rose to $11.1 billion in 2009 from $7.7 billion in 2008. In connection with the Provident and Bradford transactions, the Company added noninterest-bearing deposits totaling $946 million at the respective acquisition dates. Goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged $3.6 billion in 2009, $3.4 billion in 2008, and $3.2 billion in 2007. The cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged $1.4 billion in 2009, $1.2 billion in 2008 and $1.1 billion in 2007. Increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance are not included in interest income, but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations. The contribution of net interest-free funds to net interest margin was .28% in 2009, .37% in 2008 and .59% in 2007. The decline in the contribution to net interest margin ascribed to net interest free funds in 2009 as compared with 2008 and in 2008 as compared with 2007 resulted largely from the impact of significantly lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value such contribution.  

 Reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interest-free funds as described herein, the Companys net interest margin was 3.49% in 2009, compared with 3.38% in 2008 and 3.60% in 2007. Future changes in market interest rates or spreads, as well as changes in the composition of the Companys portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads, could adversely impact the Companys net interest income and net interest margin.  

 Management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios. In managing interest rate risk, the Company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its portfolios of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are generally reflected in either the yields earned on assets or the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. The notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, all of which were designated as fair value hedges of certain fixed rate time deposits and long-term borrowings. Under the terms of those swap agreements, the Company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount of the agreements at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates. There were no interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges at those respective dates.  

 In a fair value hedge, the fair value of the derivative (the interest rate swap agreement) and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the Companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings. The difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded in other revenues from operations in the Companys consolidated statement of income. In a cash flow hedge, unlike in a fair value hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other revenues from operations immediately. The amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized in 2009, 2008 and 2007 were not material to the Companys results of operations. The estimated aggregate fair value of interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges represented gains of approximately $54 million at December 31, 2009 and $146 million at December 31, 2008. The fair values of such swap agreements were substantially offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items. The changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads. The Companys credit exposure as of December 31, 2009 with respect to the estimated fair value of interest rate swap agreements used for managing interest rate risk has been substantially mitigated through master netting arrangements with trading account interest rate contracts with the same counterparty as well as counterparty postings of $35 million of collateral with the Company. Additional information about swap agreements and the items being hedged is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements. The average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes, the related effect on net interest income and margin, and the weighted-average interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in table 9.

 Provision for Credit Losses  

 The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in managements judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. A provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management. The provision for credit losses was $604 million in 2009, up from $412 million in 2008 and $192 million in 2007. Net loan charge-offs increased to $514 million in 2009 from $383 million and $114 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Net loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding were 1.01% in 2009, compared with .78% in 2008 and .26% in 2007. The significantly higher levels of the provision for credit losses in 2008 and 2009 as compared with 2007 reflect a pronounced downturn in the U.S. economy, which entered recession in late-2007, and significant deterioration in the residential real estate market that began in early-2007 and continued throughout 2008 and 2009. Declining real estate valuations and higher levels of delinquencies and charge-offs throughout 2007, 2008 and 2009 significantly affected the quality of the Companys residential real estate loan portfolio. Specifically, the Companys Alt-A residential real estate loan portfolio and its residential real estate builder and developer loan portfolio experienced the majority of the credit problems related to the turmoil in the residential real estate marketplace. As a result of higher unemployment levels and the recessionary economy, the Company also experienced increased levels of consumer and commercial loan charge-offs in 2009 and 2008 as compared with 2007. A summary of the Companys loan charge-offs, provision and allowance for credit losses is presented in table 10.   

 54   
 Table 10  

 LOAN CHARGE-OFFS, PROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 As already noted, loans acquired in connection with the Provident and Bradford transactions were recorded at fair value with no carry over of any previously recorded allowance for credit losses. Determining the fair value of the acquired loans required estimating cash flows expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at current interest rates. The excess of cash flows expected at acquisition over the estimated fair value is recognized as interest income over the remaining lives of the loans. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition reflects estimated credit losses and other contractually required payments that the Company does not expect to collect. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will require the Company to evaluate the need for an additional allowance for credit losses and could lead to charge-offs of acquired loan balances. Subsequent increases in expected cash flows will result in additional interest income to be recognized over the then-remaining lives of the loans.  

 Nonaccrual loans aggregated $1.33 billion or 2.56% of outstanding loans and leases at December 31, 2009, compared with $755 million or 1.54% at December 31, 2008 and $431 million or .90% at December 31, 2007. Major factors contributing to the rise in nonaccrual loans from December 31, 2008    

 55   
 to the 2009 year-end were a $209 million increase in commercial loans and leases and a $319 million increase in commercial real estate loans, including a $113 million rise in loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. Contributing to the increase in nonaccrual loans from the 2007 year-end to December 31, 2008 were a $124 million increase in loans to residential builders and developers and a $75 million increase in residential real estate loans. The continuing turbulence in the residential real estate marketplace has resulted in deteriorating real estate values and increased delinquencies, both for loans to consumers and loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. The recessionary state of the U.S. economy has resulted in generally higher levels of nonaccrual loans.  

 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more were $208 million or .40% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2009, compared with $159 million or .32% at December 31, 2008 and $77 million or .16% at December 31, 2007. Those loans included loans guaranteed by government-related entities of $193 million, $114 million and $73 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Such guaranteed loans included one-to-four family residential mortgage loans serviced by the Company that were repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs, including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors. Despite the loans being purchased by the Company, the insurance or guarantee by the applicable government-related entity remains in force. The outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans are fully guaranteed by government-related entities and totaled $176 million at December 31, 2009, $108 million at December 31, 2008 and $67 million at December 31, 2007. Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest that were guaranteed by government-related entities also included foreign commercial and industrial loans supported by the Export-Import Bank of the United States that totaled $13 million at December 31, 2009 and $5 million at each of December 31, 2008 and 2007. A summary of nonperforming assets and certain past due, renegotiated and impaired loan data and credit quality ratios is presented in table 11.  

 Table 11  

 NONPERFORMING ASSET AND PAST DUE, RENEGOTIATED AND IMPAIRED LOAN DATA  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Predominately residential mortgage loans.  

  (b)    Accruing loans that were impaired at acquisition date and recorded at fair value.    

 56   
 Loans obtained in the 2009 acquisition transactions that were impaired at the date of acquisition were recorded at estimated fair value and are generally delinquent in payments, but, in accordance with GAAP the Company continues to accrue interest income on such loans based on the estimated expected cash flows associated with the loans. The carrying amount of such loans was $88 million at December 31, 2009, or approximately .2% of total loans.  

 In an effort to assist borrowers, the Company has modified the terms of select loans secured by residential real estate. The modified loans were largely from the Companys portfolio of Alt-A loans and aggregated $292 million at December 31, 2009, of which $108 million were classified as nonaccrual. The remaining modified loans have demonstrated payment capability consistent with the modified terms and, accordingly, were classified as renegotiated loans and were accruing interest at the 2009 year-end. Loan modifications included such actions as the extension of loan maturity dates (generally from thirty to forty years) and the lowering of interest rates and monthly payments. The objective of the modifications was to increase loan repayments by customers and thereby reduce net charge-offs. In accordance with GAAP, the modified loans are included in impaired loans for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. Modified residential real estate loans totaled $162 million at December 31, 2008, of which $93 million were in nonaccrual status.  

 Net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases totaled $172 million in 2009, $94 million in 2008 and $24 million in 2007. Contributing to the rise in such charge-offs in 2009 were a $45 million partial charge-off of an unsecured loan to a single customer in the commercial real estate sector and a $42 million partial charge-off of a relationship with an operator of retirement communities. The rise in net charge-offs of commercial loans and leases from 2007 to 2008 was largely due to charge-offs of loans to a consumer debt collections company, loans to two customers in the publishing business, and three loans to automobile dealers. Nonaccrual commercial loans and leases were $322 million at December 31, 2009, $114 million at December 31, 2008 and $79 million at December 31, 2007. The rise in 2009 reflects the impact of general economic conditions on borrowers abilities to repay loans. Specifically contributing to the increase were a relationship to a single borrower that operates retirement communities ($41 million), a $37 million loan to a consumer finance and credit insurance company, a loan to a single borrower in the commercial real estate sector ($36 million) and a $22 million loan to a business in the health care sector. The increase from the 2007 year-end to December 31, 2008 reflects the net addition of relationships with automobile dealers totaling $12 million.  

 Net charge-offs of commercial real estate loans during 2009, 2008 and 2007 were $121 million, $112 million and $6 million, respectively. Reflected in 2009s charge-offs were $92 million of loans to residential real estate builders and developers, compared with $100 million in 2008 and $4 million in 2007. Commercial real estate loans classified as nonaccrual totaled $638 million at December 31, 2009, compared with $319 million at December 31, 2008 and $118 million at December 31, 2007. Contributing to the rise in such loans from December 31, 2008 to the 2009 year-end were an increase of $113 million in loans to residential homebuilders and developers and a loan collateralized by real estate in New York City ($104 million). The rise in such loans during 2008 was largely the result of an increase of $124 million in loans to residential homebuilders and developers, reflecting the impact of the deterioration of the residential real estate market, including declining real estate values. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, loans to residential homebuilders and developers classified as nonaccrual aggregated $322 million and $209 million, respectively. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off loans to residential real estate builders and developers as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 is presented in table 12.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    Includes approximately $.1 billion of loans either not secured by real estate or permanent loans to investors of apartments/multifamily properties.   

 Residential real estate loans charged off, net of recoveries, were $92 million in 2009, $63 million in 2008 and $19 million in 2007. Nonaccrual residential real estate loans at the end of 2009 totaled $281 million, compared with $256 million and $181 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Declining real estate values and higher levels of delinquencies have contributed to the higher levels of residential real estate loans classified as nonaccrual at the 2008 and 2009 year-ends as compared with December 31, 2007 and to the level of charge-offs, largely in the Companys Alt-A portfolio. Net charge-offs of Alt-A loans were $52 million in 2009, $44 million in 2008 and $12 million in 2007. Nonaccrual Alt-A loans aggregated $112 million at the 2009 year-end, compared with $125 million and $90 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $178 million, $108 million and $66 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A substantial portion of such amounts related to guaranteed loans repurchased from government-related entities. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off residential real estate loans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 is presented in table 13.  

 Net charge-offs of consumer loans during 2009 were $129 million, representing 1.10% of average consumer loans and leases outstanding, compared with $114 million or 1.03% in 2008 and $65 million or .63% in 2007. Automobile loans represented the most significant category of consumer loan charge-offs during the past three years. Net charge-offs of automobile loans were $56 million during 2009, $51 million during 2008 and $28 million during 2007. Consumer loan charge-offs also include recreational vehicle loans of $25 million, $21 million and $11 million during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and home equity loans and lines of credit secured by one-to-four family residential properties of $39 million during 2009, $31 million during 2008 and $16 million during 2007. Nonaccrual consumer loans were $91 million at December 31, 2009, representing .75% of outstanding consumer loans, compared with $66 million or .60% at December 31, 2008, and $53 million or .47% at December 31, 2007. At the 2009, 2008 and 2007 year-ends, consumer loans and leases delinquent 30-90 days totaled $141 million, $118 million and $155 million, respectively, or 1.17%, 1.07% and 1.38% of outstanding consumer loans. Consumer loans past due 90 days or more and accruing interest totaled $4 million at December 31, 2009 and $1 million at each of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007. Information about the location of nonaccrual and charged-off home equity loans and lines of credit as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009 is presented in table 13.

 SELECTED RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE-RELATED LOAN DATA  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 59   
 Management regularly assesses the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio, including such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management evaluated the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet repayment obligations when quantifying the Companys exposure to credit losses and assessing the adequacy of the Companys allowance for such losses as of each reporting date. Factors also considered by management when performing its assessment, in addition to general economic conditions and the other factors described above, included, but were not limited to: (i) the impact of declining residential real estate values in the Companys portfolio of loans to residential real estate builders and developers; (ii) the repayment performance associated with the Companys portfolio of Alt-A and other residential mortgage loans; (iii) the concentration of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (v) the size of the Companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than other loan types and for which repayment performance can be significantly affected by unemployment levels. The level of the allowance is adjusted based on the results of managements analysis.  

 Management cautiously and conservatively evaluated the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2009 in light of (i) lower residential real estate values and higher levels of delinquencies of residential real estate loans; (ii) the recession-like weak economic conditions in many of the markets served by the Company; (iii) continuing weakness in industrial employment in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania; (iv) the significant subjectivity involved in commercial real estate valuations for properties located in areas with stagnant or low growth economies; and (v) the amount of loan growth experienced by the Company. Considerable concerns exist about the economic recovery in both national and international markets; the level and volatility of energy prices; a weakened housing market; the troubled state of financial and credit markets; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; high levels of unemployment, which has caused consumer spending to slow; the underlying impact on businesses operations and abilities to repay loans as consumer spending slowed; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; and continued uncertainty about possible responses to state government budget deficits. Although the U.S. economy experienced recession and weak economic conditions during much of the last three years, as compared with other areas of the country, the impact of those conditions was not as pronounced on borrowers in the traditionally slower growth or stagnant regions of upstate New York and central Pennsylvania. Approximately one-half of the Companys loans are to customers in upstate New York and Pennsylvania. Home prices in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania were largely unchanged in 2009, in contrast to steep declines in values in other regions of the country. Therefore, despite the conditions, as previously described, the most severe credit issues experienced by the Company have been centered around residential real estate, including loans to builders and developers of residential real estate, in areas other than New York State and Pennsylvania. In response, throughout 2008 and 2009 the Company has conducted detailed reviews of all loans to residential real estate builders and developers that exceeded $2.5 million. Those credit reviews often resulted in adjustments to loan grades and, if appropriate, commencement of intensified collection efforts, including foreclosure. During 2009, the Company has also experienced increases in nonaccrual commercial loans, largely the result of a small number of large relationships, and in nonaccrual commercial real estate loans, largely due to builders and developers of residential real estate and one large loan in New York City. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate loans. On a quarterly basis, the Companys loan review department reviews all commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than $350,000 that are classified as Special Mention or worse. Meetings are held with loan officers and their managers, workout specialists and Senior Management to discuss each of the relationships. Borrower-specific information is    

 60   
 reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent developments and the borrowers outlook, and other pertinent data. The timing and extent of potential losses, considering collateral valuation, and the Companys potential courses of action are reviewed. To the extent that these loans are collateral-dependent, they are evaluated based on the fair value of the loans collateral as estimated at or near the financial statement date. As the quality of a loan deteriorates to the point of classifying the loan as Special Mention, the process of obtaining updated collateral valuation information is usually initiated, unless it is not considered warranted given factors such as the relative size of the loan, the characteristics of the collateral or the age of the last valuation. In those latter cases, when current appraisals may not yet be available, prior appraisals are utilized with adjustments, as deemed necessary, for estimates of subsequent declines in value as determined by line of business and/or loan workout personnel in the respective geographic regions. Those adjustments are reviewed and assessed for reasonableness by the Companys loan review department. Accordingly, for real estate collateral securing larger commercial and commercial real estate loans, estimated collateral values are based on current appraisals and estimates of value. For non-real estate loans, collateral is assigned a discounted estimated liquidation value and, depending on the nature of the collateral, is verified through field exams or other procedures. In assessing collateral, real estate and non-real estate values are reduced by an estimate of selling costs. With regard to residential real estate loans, with special emphasis on the portfolio of Alt-A mortgage loans, the Company expanded its collections and loan work-out staff and further refined its loss identification and estimation techniques by reference to loan performance and house price depreciation data in specific areas of the country where collateral that was securing the Companys residential real estate loans was located. For residential real estate loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is charged-off when the loan becomes 150 days delinquent. That charge-off is based on recent indications of value from external parties.  

 Factors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Companys real estate loan portfolios. Reflecting the factors and conditions as described herein, through December 31, 2009 the more significant increases in nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs of real estate-related loans have been in the Companys portfolios of residential real estate loans, including second lien Alt-A mortgage loans and loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.  

 In ascertaining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and detailed or intensified credit review processes and also estimates losses inherent in other loans and leases. In quantifying incurred losses, the Company considers the factors and uses the techniques described herein. For purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses, the Company segments its loan and lease portfolio by loan type. The amount of specific loss components in the Companys loan and lease portfolios is determined through a loan by loan analysis of commercial and commercial real estate loans greater than $350,000 which are in nonaccrual status. Measurement of the specific loss components is typically based on expected future cash flows, collateral values and other factors that may impact the borrowers ability to pay. Impaired loans are evaluated for specific loss components. Except for consumer loans and leases and residential real estate loans that are considered smaller balance homogeneous loans and are evaluated collectively, the Company considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more and has been placed in nonaccrual status. Nevertheless, modified loans, including smaller balance homogenous loans, that are considered to be troubled debt restructurings are evaluated for impairment giving consideration to the impact of the modified loan terms on the present value of the loans expected cash flows. Loans    

 61   
 less than 90 days delinquent are deemed to have a minimal delay in payment and are generally not considered to be impaired.  

 The inherent base level loss components of the Companys allowance for credit losses are generally determined by applying loss factors to specific loan balances based on loan type and managements classification of such loans under the Companys loan grading system. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate credits. Loan officers are responsible for continually assigning grades to these loans based on standards outlined in the Companys Credit Policy. Internal loan grades are also extensively monitored by the Companys loan review department to ensure consistency and strict adherence to the prescribed standards. Loan balances utilized in the inherent base level loss component computations exclude loans and leases for which specific allocations are maintained. Loan grades are assigned loss component factors that reflect the Companys loss estimate for each group of loans and leases. Factors considered in assigning loan grades and loss component factors include borrower-specific information related to expected future cash flows and operating results, collateral values, financial condition, payment status, and other information; levels of and trends in portfolio charge-offs and recoveries; levels of and trends in portfolio delinquencies and impaired loans; changes in the risk profile of specific portfolios; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of changes in credit concentrations; and observed trends and practices in the banking industry. In assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, management also gives consideration to such factors as customer, industry and geographic concentrations as well as national and local economic conditions including: (i) the comparatively poorer economic conditions and unfavorable business climate in many market regions served by the Company, specifically upstate New York and central Pennsylvania, that result in such regions generally experiencing significantly poorer economic growth and vitality as compared with much of the rest of the country; (ii) portfolio concentrations regarding loan type, collateral type and geographic location, in particular the large concentration of commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the New York City metropolitan area and other areas of New York State; and (iii) additional risk associated with the Companys portfolio of consumer loans, in particular automobile loans and leases, which generally have higher rates of loss than other types of collateralized loans.  

 In evaluating collateral, the Company relies extensively on internally and externally prepared valuations. In 2008 and 2009, valuations of residential real estate, which are usually based on sales of comparable properties, declined significantly in many regions across the United States. Commercial real estate valuations also refer to sales of comparable properties but oftentimes are based on calculations that utilize many assumptions and, as a result, can be highly subjective. Specifically, commercial real estate values can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions and interest rates, and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Additionally, management is aware that there is oftentimes a delay in the recognition of credit quality changes in loans and, as a result, in changes to assigned loan grades due to time delays in the manifestation and reporting of underlying events that impact credit quality. Accordingly, loss estimates derived from the inherent base level loss component computation are adjusted for current national and local economic conditions and trends. Economic indicators in the most significant market regions served by the Company were weak during 2009, indicative of a recessionary economy. For example, during 2009 private sector employment declined in most market areas served by the Company. Nevertheless, such declines were generally less than the national average decline of 4.4%. Private sector employment in 2009 declined 2.2% in upstate New York, 3.6% in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company, 2.8% in Maryland and 1.6% in Greater Washington D.C. Employment growth in areas of Pennsylvania served by the Company was flat in 2008, while growth in the Maryland and Greater Washington D.C. regions exceeded the national average. Additionally, although the 2.7% decline in private sector employment in New York City also trailed the national average in 2009, significant layoffs in the financial services sector in both 2008 and 2009 are expected to weigh heavily on New York City economic growth in 2010. At the end of 2009 there remain significant concerns about the pace of national economic recovery from the recession, high unemployment, real estate valuations, high levels of consumer indebtedness, weak automobile sales and volatile energy prices. Those factors are expected to have a significant impact on the national economy in 2010.   

 62   
 The specific loss components and the inherent base level loss components together comprise the total base level or allocated allowance for credit losses. Such allocated portion of the allowance represents managements assessment of losses existing in specific larger balance loans that are reviewed in detail by management and pools of other loans that are not individually analyzed. In addition, the Company has always provided an inherent unallocated portion of the allowance that is intended to recognize probable losses that are not otherwise identifiable. The inherent unallocated allowance includes managements subjective determination of amounts necessary for such things as: (i) the possible use of imprecise estimates in determining the allocated portion of the allowance; (ii) the effect of expansion into new markets, including market areas entered through acquisitions, for which the Company does not have the same degree of familiarity and experience regarding portfolio performance in changing market conditions; (iii) the introduction of new loan and lease product types; and (iv) other additional risks associated with the Companys loan portfolio which may not be specifically allocable.  

 A comparative allocation of the allowance for credit losses for each of the past five year-ends is presented in table 14. Amounts were allocated to specific loan categories based on information available to management at the time of each year-end assessment and using the methodology described herein. Variations in the allocation of the allowance by loan category as a percentage of those loans reflect changes in managements estimate of specific loss components and inherent base level loss components, including the impact of the increased delinquencies and nonaccrual loans. As described in note 4 of Notes to Financial Statements, loans considered impaired were $1.3 billion at December 31, 2009 and $617 million at December 31, 2008. The allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses related to impaired loans totaled $244 million at December 31, 2009 and $124 million at December 31, 2008. The unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was equal to .13% and .15% of gross loans outstanding at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The declines in the unallocated portion of the allowance since 2005 reflect managements continued refinement of its loss estimation techniques, which has increased the precision of its calculation of the allocated portion of the allowance for credit losses. However, given the inherent imprecision in the many estimates used in the determination of the allocated portion of the allowance, management deliberately remained cautious and conservative in establishing the overall allowance for credit losses. Given the Companys high concentration of real estate loans and considering the other factors already discussed herein, management considers the allocated and unallocated portions of the allowance for credit losses to be prudent and reasonable. Furthermore, the Companys allowance is general in nature and is available to absorb losses from any loan or lease category.  

 Table 14  

 ALLOCATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES TO LOAN CATEGORIES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Management believes that the allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2009 was adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date. The allowance for credit losses was $878 million or 1.69% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2009, compared with $788 million or    

 63   
 1.61% at December 31, 2008 and $759 million or 1.58% at December 31, 2007. The ratio of the allowance to total loans and leases at December 31, 2009 reflects the impact of $3.9 billion of loans obtained in the acquisition of Provident and in the Bradford transaction that have been recorded at estimated fair value based on estimated future cash flows expected to be received on those loans. Those cash flows reflect the impact of expected defaults on customer repayment performance. As a result, and as required by GAAP, there was no carry over of the allowance for credit losses recorded by Provident and Bradford. The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2009 as a percentage of the Companys legacy loans (that is, total loans excluding loans acquired during 2009 in the Provident and Bradford transactions) was 1.83%. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein and the Companys loan charge-off policies. Should the various credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses inherent in the loan portfolios also change, the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods. The ratio of the allowance to nonaccrual loans at the end of 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 66%, 104% and 176%, respectively. Given the Companys position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful, that ratio and changes in that ratio are generally not an indicative measure of the adequacy of the Companys allowance for credit losses, nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the adequacy of the allowance. The level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date.  

 In establishing the allowance for credit losses, management follows the methodology described herein, including taking a conservative view of borrowers abilities to repay loans. The establishment of the allowance is extremely subjective and requires management to make many judgments about borrower, industry, regional and national economic health and performance. In order to present examples of the possible impact on the allowance from certain changes in credit quality factors, the Company assumed the following scenarios for possible deterioration of credit quality:  

       For consumer loans and leases considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 20 basis point increase in loss factors;   

       For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, also considered smaller balance homogenous loans and evaluated collectively, a 15% increase in estimated inherent losses; and   

       For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, which are not similar in nature, a migration of loans to lower-ranked risk grades resulting in a 20% increase in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade.    

 For possible improvement in credit quality factors, the scenarios assumed were:  

       For consumer loans and leases, a 10 basis point decrease in loss factors;   

       For residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit, a 5% decrease in estimated inherent losses; and   

       For commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, a migration of loans to higher-ranked risk grades resulting in a 5% decrease in the balance of classified credits in each risk grade.    

 The scenario analyses resulted in an additional $95 million that could be identifiable under the assumptions for credit deterioration, whereas under the assumptions for credit improvement a $30 million reduction could occur. These examples are only a few of numerous reasonably possible scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses based on changes in assumptions and other factors.  

 Investor-owned commercial real estate loans secured by retail properties in the New York City metropolitan area represented 4% of loans outstanding at December 31, 2009. The Company had no concentrations of credit extended to any specific industry that exceeded 10% of total loans at December 31, 2009. Outstanding loans to foreign borrowers were $55 million at December 31, 2009, or .11% of total loans and leases.  

 Real estate and other foreclosed assets totaled to $95 million at December 31, 2009, compared with $100 million at December 31, 2008 and $40 million at December 31, 2007. The increase from December 31, 2007 to the two most recent year-ends resulted from higher residential real estate loan    

 64   
 defaults and additions from residential real estate development projects. At December 31, 2009, the Companys holding of residential real estate-related properties comprised 84% of foreclosed assets.  

 Other Income  

 Other income aggregated $1.05 billion in 2009, compared with $939 million in 2008. Gains and losses from bank investment securities (including other-than-temporary impairment losses) totaled to net losses of $137 million in 2009 and $148 million in 2008. During 2009, other-than-temporary impairment charges of $138 million were recognized related to certain of the Companys privately issued CMOs and CDOs and in 2008, similar losses of $182 million were recognized related to certain of the Companys privately issued CMOs, CDOs and preferred stock holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Excluding gains and losses from bank investment securities, noninterest income was $1.19 billion in 2009, 9% higher than $1.09 billion in 2008. Contributing to that improvement was the $29 million gain recognized on the Bradford acquisition transaction and higher mortgage banking revenues, service charges on deposit accounts obtained in the 2009 acquisition transactions and a smaller loss related to M&Ts equity in the operations of BLG. Partially offsetting those factors were declines in trust and brokerage services income.  

 Other income in 2008 was 1% higher than the $933 million earned in 2007. As discussed above, reflected in other income in 2008 were losses from bank investment securities of $148 million, compared with losses of $126 million in 2007 (including $127 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses). Excluding the impact of securities gains or losses, other income of $1.09 billion in 2008 was 3% higher than $1.06 billion in 2007. That rise reflects higher mortgage banking revenues and fees for providing deposit account, trust, brokerage and credit-related services that were partially offset by a $46 million decline in M&Ts pro-rata share of the operating results of BLG and lower trading account and foreign exchange gains.  

 Mortgage banking revenues were $208 million in 2009, $156 million in 2008 and $112 million in 2007. Mortgage banking revenues are comprised of both residential and commercial mortgage banking activities. The Companys involvement in commercial mortgage banking activities includes the origination, sales and servicing of loans under the multi-family loan programs of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.  

 Residential mortgage banking revenues, consisting of realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights, unrealized gains and losses on residential mortgage loans held for sale and related commitments, residential mortgage loan servicing fees, and other residential mortgage loan-related fees and income, were $166 million in 2009, $117 million in 2008 and $86 million in 2007. The substantially higher revenues in 2009 as compared with the previous two years were attributable to significantly higher origination activity, due largely to refinancing of loans by consumers in response to relatively low interest rates, and wider margins associated with that activity. Reflected in the 2007 total was the previously described $12 million of Alt-A-related losses in that years first quarter and the impact of lower gains on residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights due to slimmer margins realized by the Company resulting from changes in market conditions during that year.  

 Residential mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $6.2 billion in 2009, compared with $4.4 billion in 2008 and $5.6 billion in 2007. Residential mortgage loans sold to investors totaled $5.9 billion in 2009, $4.4 billion in 2008 and $5.3 billion in 2007. Realized gains from sales of residential mortgage loans and loan servicing rights and recognized net unrealized gains or losses attributable to residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to originate loans for sale and commitments to sell loans totaled $79 million in 2009, compared with $31 million in 2008 and $3 million in 2007. Reflected in the 2008 gains were approximately $7 million of revenues related to the January 1, 2008 adoption of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 109 for written loan commitments issued or modified after January 1, 2008. In November 2007, the SEC issued SAB No. 109, which reversed previous conclusions expressed by the SEC staff regarding written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. Specifically, the SEC staff now believes that the expected net future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan should be included in the fair value measurement of the derivative loan commitment. In accordance with SAB No. 105, Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments, the Company had not included such amounts in the value    

 65   
 of loan commitments accounted for as derivatives in 2007. As previously described, reflected in 2007 were $12 million of losses related to Alt-A residential mortgage loans that were recognized during the first quarter of 2007.  

 Revenues from servicing residential mortgage loans for others were $82 million in 2009, compared with $81 million in 2008 and $73 million in 2007. Included in such servicing revenues were amounts related to purchased servicing rights associated with small balance commercial mortgage loans totaling $29 million in each of 2009 and 2008, compared with $21 million in 2007. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others aggregated $21.4 billion at December 31, 2009, $21.3 billion a year earlier and $19.4 billion at December 31, 2007, including the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of approximately $5.5 billion, $5.9 billion and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, net of a valuation allowance for possible impairment, totaled $141 million at December 31, 2009, compared with $143 million and $170 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The valuation allowance for possible impairment of capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets totaled $50 thousand, $22 million and $6 million at the 2009, 2008 and 2007 year-ends, respectively. Included in capitalized residential mortgage servicing assets were purchased servicing rights associated with the small balance commercial mortgage loans noted above of $40 million, $58 million and $57 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Servicing rights for the small balance commercial mortgage loans were purchased from BLG or its affiliates. In addition, at December 31, 2009 capitalized servicing rights included $17 million of servicing rights for $4.1 billion of residential real estate loans that were purchased from affiliates of BLG. Additional information about the Companys relationship with BLG and its affiliates is provided in note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements. Additional information about the Companys capitalized residential mortgage loan servicing assets, including information about the calculation of estimated fair value, is presented in note 7 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Commitments to sell residential mortgage loans and commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale at pre-determined rates were $936 million and $631 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009, $898 million and $871 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008 and $772 million and $492 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Net unrealized gains on residential mortgage loans held for sale, commitments to sell loans, and commitments to originate loans for sale were $15 million and $6 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, compared with net unrealized losses of $7 million at December 31, 2007. Changes in such net unrealized gains and losses are recorded in mortgage banking revenues and resulted in net increases in revenue of $9 million and $13 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, and a net decrease in revenue of $23 million in 2007 (including $12 million to record the Alt-A mortgage loans transferred from held for sale to held for investment at the lower of cost or market value in 2007).  

 Commercial mortgage banking revenues totaled $42 million in 2009, $39 million in 2008 and $26 million in 2007. Revenues from loan origination and sales activities were $27 million in each of 2009 and 2008, and $13 million in 2007. Improved margins in 2009 were offset by a decline in loan origination volume as compared with 2008. The increased revenues in 2008 as compared with 2007 reflect higher loan origination volumes. Commercial mortgage loans originated for sale to other investors totaled approximately $1.1 billion in each of 2009 and 2007, compared with $1.4 billion in 2008. Loan servicing revenues totaled $15 million in 2009, $12 million in 2008 and $13 million in 2007. Capitalized commercial mortgage loan servicing assets aggregated $33 million at December 31, 2009, $26 million at December 31, 2008 and $20 million at December 31, 2007. Commercial mortgage loans serviced for other investors totaled $7.1 billion, $6.4 billion and $5.3 billion at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and included $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, of loan balances for which investors had recourse to the Company if such balances are ultimately uncollectible. Commitments to sell commercial mortgage loans and commitments to originate commercial mortgage loans for sale were $303 million and $180 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009, $408 million and $252 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008 and $176 million and $97 million, respectively, at December 31, 2007. Commercial mortgage loans held for sale totaled $123 million, $156 million and $79 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.   

 66   
 Service charges on deposit accounts rose 9% to $469 million in 2009 from $431 million in 2008. That improvement resulted predominantly from the impact of the acquisition of Provident. Deposit account service charges in 2007 were $409 million. The higher level of service charges on deposit accounts in 2008 as compared with 2007 was largely due to increases in service charges on commercial accounts and consumer debit card fees due to higher transaction volumes. Certain fees charged by financial institutions for deposit services have come under scrutiny by lawmakers and regulators. The Federal Reserve and other bank regulators have adopted regulations requiring expanded disclosure of overdraft and other fees assessed to consumers and have issued guidance that will allow consumers to elect to not be subject to fees for certain deposit account transactions beginning in 2010. The Company intends to comply with these regulations but, at the present time, cannot predict the extent to which customers will elect to not avail themselves of the respective deposit account services.  

 Trust income includes fees for trust and custody services provided to personal, corporate and institutional customers, and investment management and advisory fees that are often based on a percentage of the market value of assets under management. Trust income declined 18% to $129 million in 2009 from $156 million in 2008. Contributing to that decline were lower fees for providing services that are based on market values of assets under administration, the impact of lower balances in proprietary mutual funds and the impact of fee waivers by the Company in order to continue to pay customers a yield on their investments in proprietary money-market mutual funds. Those waived fees were approximately $10 million in 2009. Trust income totaled $153 million in 2007. Total trust assets, which include assets under management and assets under administration, aggregated $111.6 billion at December 31, 2009, compared with $111.0 billion at December 31, 2008. Trust assets under management were $13.8 billion and $12.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The Companys proprietary mutual funds, the MTB Group of Funds, had assets of $7.9 billion and $11.5 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 Brokerage services income, which includes revenues from the sale of mutual funds and annuities and securities brokerage fees, aggregated $58 million in 2009, $64 million in 2008 and $60 million in 2007. The decrease in revenues in 2009 as compared with the previous year was largely attributable to lower fees for providing services that are tied to the performance of bond and equity markets. The improvement from 2007 to 2008 was due largely to increased revenues earned from the sale of annuities. Trading account and foreign exchange activity resulted in gains of $23 million in 2009, $18 million in 2008 and $30 million in 2007. The higher revenues in 2009 as compared with 2008 were due to increases in market values of trading assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans, while the decline in revenues from 2007 to 2008 resulted from decreases in the market values of such trading assets. The Company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts with customers who need such services and concomitantly enters into offsetting trading positions with third parties to minimize the risks involved with these types of transactions. Information about the notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange and other contracts entered into by the Company for trading account purposes is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements and herein under the heading Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity. Trading account revenues related to interest rate and foreign exchange contracts totaled $10 million in 2009, compared with $21 million in each of 2008 and 2007. That decline related predominantly to lower new volumes of interest rate swap agreement transactions executed on behalf of commercial customers. Trading account assets held in connection with deferred compensation plans were $36 million and $33 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Trading account revenues resulting from net increases in the market values of such assets were $4 million in each of 2009 and 2007, compared with losses of $12 million in 2008. A largely offsetting impact on expenses resulting from corresponding increases or decreases in liabilities related to deferred compensation is included in other costs of operations.  

 Including other-than-temporary impairment losses, the Company recognized net losses on investment securities of $137 million during 2009, compared with $148 million and $126 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Other-than-temporary impairment charges of $138 million, $182 million and $127 million were recorded in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. During 2009, the Company recognized impairment charges on certain privately issued CMOs backed by residential real estate loans and CDOs backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and other entities. The impairment    

 67   
 charges recognized in 2008 included write-downs of $153 million related to preferred stock issuances of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and $29 million related to CMOs and CDOs in the investment securities portfolio and were partially offset by a gain of $33 million related to the mandatory redemption of common shares of Visa during the first quarter of that year. The losses in 2007 reflect the previously described $127 million charge for the other-than-temporary impairment in value of CDOs backed by residential mortgage-backed securities. Each reporting period the Company reviews its impaired investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment. For equity securities, such as the Companys investment in the preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Company considers various factors to determine if the decline in value is other than temporary, including the duration and extent of the decline in value, the factors contributing to the decline in fair value, including the financial condition of the issuer as well as the conditions of the industry in which it operates, and the prospects for a recovery in fair value of the equity security. For debt securities, the Company analyzes the creditworthiness of the issuer or reviews the credit performance of the underlying collateral supporting the bond. For debt securities backed by pools of loans, such as privately issued mortgage-backed securities, the Company estimates the cash flows of the underlying loan collateral using forward-looking assumptions of default rates, loss severities and prepayment speeds. Estimated collateral cash flows are then utilized to estimate bond-specific cash flows to determine the ultimate collectibility of the bond. If the present value of the cash flows indicates that the Company should not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a bond or if the Company intends to sell the bond or it more likely than not will be required to sell the bond before recovery of its amortized cost basis, an other-than-temporary impairment loss is recognized. If an other-than-temporary impairment loss is deemed to have occurred, the investment securitys cost basis is adjusted, as appropriate for the circumstances.  

 M&Ts pro-rata share of the operating losses of BLG in 2009 and 2008 was $26 million and $37 million, respectively, compared with a gain of $9 million in 2007. The operating losses of BLG in 2009 and 2008 resulted from the disruptions in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market and reflected losses from loan securitization and sales activities, lower values ascribed to loans held for sale, higher provisions for losses associated with loans held by BLG, and costs associated with severance and certain lease terminations incurred by BLG as it downsized its operations. Despite the credit and liquidity disruptions that began in 2007, BLG had been successfully securitizing and selling significant volumes of small-balance commercial real estate loans until the first quarter of 2008. In response to the illiquidity in the marketplace since that time, BLG reduced its originations activities, scaled back its workforce and made use of its contingent liquidity sources. In addition to BLGs mortgage originations and sales capabilities, BLG is also entitled to cash flows from mortgage assets that it owns or that are owned by its affiliates and from asset management and other services provided by its affiliates. Accordingly, the Company believes that BLG is capable of realizing positive cash flows that could be available for distribution to its owners, including M&T, despite a lack of positive GAAP-earnings. Nevertheless, if BLG is not able to realize sufficient cash flows for the benefit of M&T, the Company may be required to recognize an other-than-temporary impairment charge in a future period for some portion of the $246 million book value of its investment in BLG. Information about the Companys relationship with BLG and its affiliates is included in note 25 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Other revenues from operations totaled $325 million in 2009, compared with $300 million in 2008 and $286 million in 2007. The improvement from 2008 to 2009 reflects the $29 million gain recognized on the Bradford transaction in 2009 offset, in part, by modest decreases in other miscellaneous fees and revenues. The primary contributor to the 5% improvement from 2007 to 2008 was a $16 million increase in letter of credit and other credit-related fees.  

 Included in other revenues from operations were the following significant components. Letter of credit and other credit-related fees totaled $100 million, $97 million and $81 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The rise in such fees from 2007 to 2008 was due predominately to higher income from providing loan syndication and letter of credit services. Tax-exempt income earned from bank owned life insurance aggregated $49 million in each of 2009 and 2008, and $47 million in 2007. Such income includes increases in cash surrender value of life insurance policies and benefits received. Revenues from merchant discount and credit card fees were $40 million in each of 2009 and 2008, and $35 million in 2007. Insurance-related sales commissions and other revenues totaled $42 million in 2009, $31 million in    

 68   
 2008 and $33 million in 2007. Automated teller machine usage fees aggregated $19 million in 2009, $17 million in 2008 and $15 million in 2007.  

 Other Expense  

 Other expense aggregated $1.98 billion in 2009, compared with $1.73 billion in 2008 and $1.63 billion in 2007. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $64 million, $67 million and $66 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and merger-related expenses of $89 million in 2009, $4 million in 2008 and $15 million in 2007. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $1.83 billion in 2009, up 10% from $1.66 billion in 2008. The most significant factors for the rise in operating expenses from 2008 to 2009 were costs associated with the acquired operations of Provident and Bradford, a $90 million increase in FDIC assessments (including approximately $9 million relating to deposits from Provident and Bradford) and higher foreclosure-related expenses. The impact of those increases was mitigated by a reversal of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $22 million in 2009, as compared with an addition to that valuation allowance of $16 million in 2008. Noninterest operating expenses were $1.55 billion in 2007. The higher level of operating expenses in 2008 as compared with 2007 was due largely to increased expenses for salaries, occupancy, professional services, advertising and promotion, and foreclosed residential real estate properties. Also contributing to the rise in operating expenses was an addition to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $16 million in 2008, as compared with a partial reversal of the allowance of $4 million in 2007. Partially offsetting those factors was a $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to M&T Banks obligation as a member bank of Visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation against Visa, compared with a partial reversal of that charge in 2008s initial quarter of $15 million.  

 Salaries and employee benefits expense totaled $1.00 billion in 2009, up 5% from $957 million in 2008. The higher expense levels in 2009 as compared with 2008 reflect the impact of the 2009 acquisition transactions and included $10 million of merger-related expenses in 2009. Those expenses consisted predominantly of severance expense for Provident employees. Also contributing to the increased expenses in 2009 were higher costs for providing medical and pension benefits. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $908 million in 2007. The most significant contributors to the increase from 2007 to 2008 were the impact of annual merit increases, higher incentive compensation and the fourth quarter 2007 acquisition transactions. Stock-based compensation totaled $54 million in 2009, $50 million in 2008 and $51 million in 2007. The number of full-time equivalent employees was 13,639 at December 31, 2009, compared with 12,978 and 13,246 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 The Company provides pension and other postretirement benefits (including a retirement savings plan) for its employees. Expenses related to such benefits totaled $60 million in 2009, $52 million in 2008 and $54 million in 2007. The Company sponsors both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. Pension benefit expense for those plans was $32 million in 2009, $23 million in 2008 and $27 million in 2007. Included in those amounts are $11 million in 2009, $10 million in 2008 and $8 million in 2007 for a defined contribution pension plan that the Company began on January 1, 2006. The determination of pension expense and the recognition of net pension assets and liabilities for defined benefit pension plans requires management to make various assumptions that can significantly impact the actuarial calculations related thereto. Those assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the discount rate. Changes in any of those assumptions will impact the Companys pension expense. The expected long-term rate of return assumption is determined by taking into consideration asset allocations, historical returns on the types of assets held and current economic factors. Returns on invested assets are periodically compared with target market indices for each asset type to aid management in evaluating such returns. The discount rate used by the Company to determine the present value of the Companys future benefit obligations reflects specific market yields for a hypothetical portfolio of highly rated corporate bonds that would produce cash flows similar to the Companys benefit plan obligations and the level of market interest rates in general as of the year-end. Other factors used to estimate the projected benefit obligations include actuarial assumptions for mortality rate, turnover rate, retirement rate and disability    

 69   
 rate. Those other factors do not tend to change significantly over time. The Company reviews its pension plan assumptions annually to ensure that such assumptions are reasonable and adjusts those assumptions, as necessary, to reflect changes in future expectations. The Company utilizes actuaries and others to aid in that assessment.  

 The Companys 2009 pension expense for its defined benefit plans was determined using the following assumptions: a long-term rate of return on assets of 6.5%; a rate of future compensation increase of 4.6%; and a discount rate of 6.0%. To demonstrate the sensitivity of pension expense to changes in the Companys pension plan assumptions, 25 basis point increases in: the rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $2 million; the rate of increase in compensation would have resulted in an increase in pension expense of $.3 million; and the discount rate would have resulted in a decrease in pension expense of $2 million. Decreases of 25 basis points in those assumptions would have resulted in similar changes in amount, but in the opposite direction from the changes presented in the preceding sentence. The accounting guidance for defined benefit pension plans reflects the long-term nature of benefit obligations and the investment horizon of plan assets, and has the effect of reducing expense volatility related to short-term changes in interest rates and market valuations. Actuarial gains and losses include the impact of plan amendments, in addition to various gains and losses resulting from changes in assumptions and investment returns which are different from that which is assumed. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had cumulative unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately $239 million that could result in an increase in the Companys future pension expense depending on several factors, including whether such losses at each measurement date exceed ten percent of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets. In accordance with GAAP, net unrecognized gains or losses that exceed that threshold are required to be amortized over the expected service period of active employees, and are included as a component of net pension cost. Amortization of these net unrealized losses had the effect of increasing the Companys pension expense by approximately $10 million in 2009, $4 million in 2008 and $6 million in 2007.  

 GAAP requires an employer to recognize in its balance sheet as an asset or liability the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other postretirement benefit plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise during the period, but are not included as components of net periodic benefit cost, are to be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income. As of December 31, 2009, the combined benefit obligations of the Companys defined benefit postretirement plans exceeded the fair value of the assets of such plans by approximately $147 million. Of that amount, $27 million was related to qualified defined benefit plans that are periodically funded by the Company and $120 million related to non-qualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans that are generally not funded until benefits are paid. The Company was required to have a net pension and postretirement benefit liability for those plans that was at least equal to $147 million at December 31, 2009. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2009 the Company recorded an additional postretirement benefit liability of $193 million. After applicable tax effect, that liability reduced accumulated other comprehensive income (and thereby stockholders equity) by $117 million. The result of this, however, was a year-over-year decrease of $94 million to the required minimum postretirement benefit liability from the $286 million recorded at December 31, 2008. After applicable tax effect, the $94 million decrease in the minimum required liability increased accumulated other comprehensive income in 2009 by $57 million from the prior year-end amount of $174 million. The $94 million decrease to the liability was the result of gains that occurred during 2009 resulting from actual experience differing from actuarial assumptions and from changes in those assumptions. The main factor contributing to those gains was the improved performance of the qualified defined benefit plan assets, reflecting the overall improvement in global financial markets. In determining the benefit obligation for defined benefit postretirement plans the Company used a discount rate of 5.75% at December 31, 2009 and 6% at December 31, 2008. A 25 basis point decrease in the assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2009 to 5.50% would have resulted in increases in the combined benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans (including pension and other plans) of $31 million. Under that scenario, the minimum postretirement liability adjustment at    

 70   
 December 31, 2009 would have been $224 million, rather than the $193 million that was actually recorded, and the corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2009 would have been $135 million, rather than the $117 million that was actually recorded. A 25 basis point increase in the assumed discount rate to 6.00% would have decreased the combined benefit obligations of all defined benefit postretirement plans by $29 million. Under this latter scenario, the aggregate minimum liability adjustment at December 31, 2009 would have been $164 million rather than the $193 million actually recorded and the corresponding after tax-effect charge to accumulated other comprehensive income would have been $99 million rather than $117 million. During the second quarter of 2009, the Company elected to contribute 900,000 shares of common stock of M&T having a fair value of $44 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plan. During 2008, the Company made cash contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plan totaling $140 million. Information about the Companys pension plans, including significant assumptions utilized in completing actuarial calculations for the plans, is included in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Company also provides a retirement savings plan (RSP) that is a defined contribution plan in which eligible employees of the Company may defer up to 50% of qualified compensation via contributions to the plan. The Company makes an employer matching contribution in an amount equal to 75% of an employees contribution, up to 4.5% of the employees qualified compensation. RSP expense totaled $24 million in 2009, $23 million in 2008 and $22 million in 2007.  

 Expenses associated with the defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and the RSP totaled $56 million in 2009, $47 million in 2008 and $49 million in 2007. Expense associated with providing medical and other postretirement benefits was $4 million in 2009 and $5 million in each of 2008 and 2007.  

 Excluding the nonoperating expense items already noted, nonpersonnel operating expenses totaled $835 million in 2009, up 19% from $700 million in 2008. Higher FDIC deposit assessments were a significant contributor to that rise. In total, FDIC assessments in 2009 were $97 million, including a $33 million special assessment in the second quarter, compared with $7 million in 2008. Also contributing to the higher level of operating expenses in 2009 were costs associated with the acquired operations of Provident and Bradford and expenses related to the foreclosure process for residential real estate properties. Finally, a $15 million reversal in the first quarter of 2008 of an accrual established in the fourth quarter of 2007 for estimated losses stemming from certain litigation involving Visa also contributed to the year-over-year variance. Partially offsetting those factors was the impact of partial reversals of the valuation allowance for impairment of residential mortgage servicing rights in 2009 of $22 million, compared with additions to the valuation allowance of $16 million in 2008. Nonpersonnel operating expenses were $639 million in 2007. Contributing to the rise from 2007 to 2008 were increases in costs for occupancy, professional services, advertising and promotion, contributions to The M&T Charitable Foundation, and higher expenses related to foreclosed residential real estate properties. Also contributing to the higher level of operating expenses was an addition to the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $16 million in 2008, as compared with a partial reversal of the allowance of $4 million in 2007. Partially offsetting those factors was the $23 million charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2007 related to M&T Banks obligation as a member bank of Visa to share in losses stemming from certain litigation against Visa, compared with a partial reversal of that charge in 2008s initial quarter of $15 million.  

 Income Taxes  

 The provision for income taxes was $139 million in 2009, compared with $184 million in 2008 and $309 million in 2007. The effective tax rates were 26.8%, 24.9% and 32.1% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The recent years provision for income taxes was reduced as a result of a $10 million reversal of taxes accrued in earlier periods for previously uncertain tax positions in various jurisdictions. Income taxes in 2008 reflect the resolution in that year of previously uncertain tax positions related to the Companys activities in various jurisdictions during the years 1999-2007 that allowed the Company to reduce its accrual for income taxes in the third quarter of 2008 by $40 million. Exclusive of the impact of the $10 million and the $40 million credits to income taxes in 2009 and 2008, respectively, the effective tax rates in 2009 and 2008 were 28.8% and 30.3%, respectively. The effective tax rate is affected by the    

 71   
 level of income earned that is exempt from tax, the level of income allocated to the various state and local jurisdictions where the Company operates, because tax rates differ among those jurisdictions, and the impact of any large but infrequently occurring items. For example, although the higher merger-related expenses incurred during 2009 are predominantly deductible for purposes of computing income tax expense, those charges had an impact on the effective tax rate because they lowered pre-tax income relative to the amounts of tax-exempt income and other permanent differences that impact the effective tax rate. Excluding the impact of the: (i) other-than-temporary impairment charges from pre-tax income and income tax expense in 2009, 2008 and 2007; (ii) net merger-related expenses of $60 million in 2009, $4 million in 2008 and $15 million in 2007; and (iii) the $10 million and $40 million credits to income tax expense in 2009 and 2008, respectively, the Companys effective tax rates for 2009, 2008 and 2007 would have been 31.6%, 32.1% and 33.0%, respectively.  

 The Companys effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the results of operations allocated to the various tax jurisdictions within which the Company operates, any change in income tax laws or regulations within those jurisdictions, and interpretations of income tax regulations that differ from the Companys interpretations by any of various tax authorities that may examine tax returns filed by M&T or any of its subsidiaries. Information about amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions and a reconciliation of income tax expense to the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income is provided in note 13 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 International Activities  

 The Companys net investment in international assets totaled $62 million at December 31, 2009 and $99 million at December 31, 2008. Such assets included $55 million and $91 million, respectively, of loans to foreign borrowers. Offshore deposits totaled $1.1 billion at December 31, 2009 and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2008. The Company uses such deposits to facilitate customer demand and as an alternative to short-term borrowings when the costs of such deposits seem reasonable.  

 Liquidity, Market Risk, and Interest Rate Sensitivity  

 As a financial intermediary, the Company is exposed to various risks, including liquidity and market risk. Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.  

 Core deposits have historically been the most significant funding source for the Company and are generated from a large base of consumer, corporate and institutional customers. That customer base has, over the past several years, become more geographically diverse as a result of acquisitions and expansion of the Companys businesses. Nevertheless, the Company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants, including banks, thrifts, mutual funds, securities dealers and others. Core deposits financed 72% of the Companys earning assets at December 31, 2009, compared with 60% and 54% at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The substantial increase in the amount of earning assets financed by core deposits at the 2009 year-end as compared with a year earlier was the result of an $8.7 billion, or 25%, rise in core deposits, largely due to higher noninterest-bearing deposits.  

 The Company supplements funding provided through core deposits with various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch deposits and borrowings from the FHLBs and others. At December 31, 2009, M&T Bank had short-term and long-term credit facilities with the FHLBs aggregating $6.5 billion. Outstanding borrowings under these credit facilities totaled $5.4 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Such borrowings are secured by loans and investment securities. M&T Bank and M&T Bank, N.A. had available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that totaled approximately $7.0 billion at December 31, 2009. The amounts of those lines are dependent upon the balances of loans and securities pledged as collateral. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2008, secured    

 72   
 short-term borrowings from the Federal Reserve totaled $1.0 billion. Those borrowings were bid for by the Company through the Federal Reserves TAF program and had maturities of 84 days.  

 As a source of funding and to enhance regulatory capital ratios, during January 2008, M&T Capital Trust IV issued $350 million of Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities bearing a fixed rate of interest of 8.50% and maturing in 2068. The related junior subordinated debentures are included in long-term borrowings. Such securities qualify for inclusion in the Companys Tier 1 Capital as defined by federal regulators. The Company has issued subordinated capital notes from time to time to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios. Such notes qualify for inclusion in the Companys total capital as defined by federal regulators. Information about the Companys borrowings is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Company has informal and sometimes reciprocal sources of funding available through various arrangements for unsecured short-term borrowings from a wide group of banks and other financial institutions. Short-term federal funds borrowings were $2.1 billion and $809 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. In general, those borrowings were unsecured and matured on the next business day. As already noted, offshore branch deposits and brokered certificates of deposit have been used by the Company as an alternative to short-term borrowings. Offshore branch deposits also generally mature on the next business day and totaled $1.1 billion and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Outstanding brokered time deposits at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 were $868 million and $487 million, respectively. Such deposits at December 31, 2009 included $813 million of brokered time deposits obtained in the acquisition of Provident. At December 31, 2009, the weighted-average remaining term to maturity of brokered time deposits was 21 months. Certain of these brokered deposits have provisions that allow for early redemption. The Company also had brokered NOW and brokered money-market deposit accounts which aggregated $618 million and $537 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 The Companys ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively affected should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should the availability of short-term funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets. The Company attempts to quantify such credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. Such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. Information about the credit ratings of M&T and M&T Bank is presented in table 15. Additional information regarding the terms and maturities of all of the Companys short-term and long-term borrowings is provided in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. In addition to deposits and borrowings, other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets, repayments of loans and investment securities, and cash generated from operations, such as fees collected for services.

 Certain customers of the Company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds (VRDBs). The VRDBs are generally enhanced by direct-pay letters of credit provided by M&T Bank. M&T Bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the VRDBs and, at its discretion, may from time-to-time own some of the VRDBs while such instruments are remarketed. When this occurs, the VRDBs are classified as trading assets in the Companys consolidated balance sheet. Nevertheless, M&T Bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the VRDBs. The value of VRDBs in the Companys trading account totaled $19 million and $29 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At each of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the VRDBs outstanding backed by M&T Bank letters of credit totaled $1.9 billion. M&T Bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds.

 The Company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business which require future cash payments. The contractual amounts and timing of those payments as of December 31, 2009 are summarized in table 17. Off-balance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, commercial letters of credit, financial guarantees and indemnification contracts, and commitments to sell real estate loans. Because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part, the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows. Further discussion of these commitments is provided in note 21 of Notes to Financial Statements. Table 17 summarizes the Companys other commitments as of December 31, 2009 and the timing of the expiration of such commitments.

 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 M&Ts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses, shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its banking subsidiaries, which are subject to various regulatory limitations. Dividends from any banking subsidiary to M&T are limited by the amount of earnings of the banking subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years. For purposes of the test, approximately $1.2 billion at December 31, 2009 was available for payment of dividends to M&T from banking subsidiaries. These historic sources of cash flow have been augmented in the past by the issuance of trust preferred securities and senior notes payable. Information regarding trust preferred securities, the related junior subordinated debentures and senior notes is included in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. M&T also maintains a $30 million line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank, of which there were no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2009. A similar $30 million line of credit was entirely available for borrowing at December 31, 2008.

 Management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the normal course of business. Management does not anticipate engaging in any activities, either currently or in the long-term, for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either M&T or its subsidiary banks.  

 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices and/or interest rates of the Companys financial instruments. The primary market risk the Company is exposed to is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk arises from the Companys core banking activities of lending and deposit-taking, because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income earned by the Company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk. Managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income. The balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities, anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities, and expected maturities of investment securities, loans and deposits. Management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above. Those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a long-term interest rate risk metric. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk. At December 31, 2009, the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was $1.1 billion. Information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading Net Interest Income/Lending and Funding Activities and in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Companys Risk Management Committee, which includes members of senior management, monitors the sensitivity of the Companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios. In modeling changing interest rates, the Company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel (that is, simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve) and non-parallel (that is, allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts) shifts in the yield curve. In utilizing the model, market implied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation. That calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios. The model considers the impact of ongoing lending and deposit-gathering activities, as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments, including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities. When deemed prudent, management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on-or off-balance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future. Possible actions include, but are    

 77   
 not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes.  

 Table 20 displays as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 the estimated impact on net interest income from non-trading financial instruments in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year.  

 Table 20  

 SENSITIVITY OF NET INTEREST INCOME TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The Company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income. The more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgage-related assets, cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for non-trading purposes, loan and deposit volumes and pricing, and deposit maturities. In the scenarios presented, the Company also assumed gradual changes in rates during a twelve-month period of 100 and 200 basis points, as compared with the assumed base scenario. In the event that a 100 or 200 basis point rate change cannot be achieved, the applicable rate changes are limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates cannot be less than zero. The assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the Company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials (spreads) between maturity/repricing categories, as well as any actions, such as those previously described, which management may take to counter such changes. In light of the uncertainties and assumptions associated with the process, the amounts presented in the table are not considered significant to the Companys past or projected net interest income.  

 Table 21 presents cumulative totals of net assets (liabilities) repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames, as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes. Management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities equally nor, as assumed in the table, on the contractual maturity or repricing date. Furthermore, this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities, projected changes in balance sheet composition or any subsequent interest rate risk management activities the Company is likely to implement.

 Changes in fair value of the Companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets. That impact is most notable on the values assigned to the Companys investment securities. Information about the fair valuation of such securities is presented herein under the heading Capital and in notes 3 and 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Company engages in trading activities to meet the financial needs of customers, to fund the Companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans and, to a limited extent, to profit from perceived market opportunities. Financial instruments utilized in trading activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts, such as swap agreements, and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies, but have also included forward and futures contracts related to mortgage-backed securities and investments in U.S. Treasury and other government securities, mortgage-backed securities and mutual funds and, as previously described, a limited number of VRDBs. The Company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading activities by entering into offsetting trading positions. The amounts of gross and net trading positions, as well as the type of trading activities conducted by the Company, are subject to a well-defined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by M&Ts Board of Directors. However, as with any non-government guaranteed financial instrument, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the Companys trading activities.  

 The notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading purposes aggregated $13.9 billion at December 31, 2009 and $14.6 billion at December 31, 2008. The notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading purposes totaled $608 million and $713 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Although the notional amounts of these trading contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet, the fair values of all financial instruments used for trading activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of trading account assets and liabilities were $387 million and $302 million, respectively, at December 31, 2009 and $618 million and $521 million, respectively, at December 31, 2008. Included in trading account assets at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $36 million and $33 million, respectively, of assets related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the fair value of such assets are recorded as    

 79   
 trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income. Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at each of December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $38 million of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans. Changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income.  

 Given the Companys policies, limits and positions, management believes that the potential loss exposure to the Company resulting from market risk associated with trading activities was not material, however, as previously noted, the Company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions associated with the Companys trading activities. Additional information about the Companys use of derivative financial instruments in its trading activities is included in note 18 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Capital  

 Stockholders equity at December 31, 2009 was $7.8 billion and represented 11.26% of total assets, compared with $6.8 billion or 10.31% at December 31, 2008 and $6.5 billion or 10.00% at December 31, 2007. Included in stockholders equity at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008 was $600 million of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, and warrants to purchase M&T common stock issued on December 23, 2008 as part of the U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program. Provident also participated in that program in November 2008. As a result, Providents $151.5 million of preferred stock related thereto was converted to M&T Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, with warrants to purchase M&T common stock. The holder of the Series A and Series C preferred stock is entitled to cumulative cash dividends of 5% per annum for five years after the date of initial issuance and 9% per annum thereafter, payable quarterly in arrears. That preferred stock is redeemable at the option of M&T, subject to regulatory approval. M&T also obtained another series of preferred stock as part of the Provident acquisition that was converted to $26.5 million of M&T Series B Mandatory Convertible Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. The 26,500 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock will automatically convert into 433,148 shares of M&T common stock on April 1, 2011. The Series B Preferred Stock pays dividends at a rate of 10% per annum on the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, payable quarterly in arrears. The estimated fair values ascribed to the preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock of M&T associated with the acquisition of Provident were $156 million and $6 million, respectively, on the May 23, 2009 acquisition date. Additional information related to M&Ts preferred stock and the related warrants to purchase common stock is included in note 10 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Common stockholders equity was $7.0 billion, or $59.31 per share, at December 31, 2009, compared with $6.2 billion, or $56.29 per share, at December 31, 2008 and $6.5 billion, or $58.99 per share, at December 31, 2007. Tangible equity per common share, which excludes goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets and applicable deferred tax balances, was $28.27 at December 31, 2009, compared with $25.94 and $27.98 at December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Companys ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was 5.13% at December 31, 2009, compared with 4.59% and 5.01% at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. Reconciliations of total common stockholders equity and tangible common equity as of December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 are presented in table 2. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, the ratio of average total stockholders equity to average total assets was 10.79%, 9.88% and 10.67%, respectively. The ratio of average common stockholders equity to average total assets was 9.81%, 9.86% and 10.67% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  

 Stockholders equity reflects accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, which includes the net after-tax impact of unrealized gains or losses on investment securities classified as available for sale, gains or losses associated with interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges, and adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities, net of applicable tax effect, were $220 million, or $1.86 per common share, at December 31, 2009, compared with losses of $557 million, or $5.04 per common share, at December 31, 2008, and $59 million, or $.54 per common share, at December 31, 2007. Such unrealized losses represent the difference, net of applicable income tax effect, between the    

 80   
 estimated fair value and amortized cost of investment securities classified as available for sale, including the remaining unamortized unrealized losses on investment securities that have been transferred to held-to-maturity classification. The increase in net unrealized losses from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 resulted primarily from pre-tax net unrealized losses of $786 million on $3.2 billion of privately issued mortgage-backed securities at December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, pre-tax net unrealized losses on the Companys remaining $2.5 billion of privately issued mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale had decreased to $381 million.  

 Reflected in net unrealized losses at December 31, 2009 were pre tax-effect unrealized losses of $483 million on available-for-sale investment securities with an amortized cost of $3.0 billion and pre-tax effect unrealized gains of $190 million on securities with an amortized cost of $4.0 billion. The pre-tax effect unrealized losses reflect $383 million of losses considered Level 3 valuations on privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities having an amortized cost of $2.0 billion and an estimated fair value of $1.6 billion and $58 million of losses generally considered Level 2 valuations on trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions having an amortized cost of $196 million and an estimated fair value of $138 million.  

 The Companys privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities classified as available for sale are generally collateralized by prime and Alt-A residential mortgage loans as depicted in table 22. Information in the table is as of December 31, 2009. As with any accounting estimate or other data, changes in fair values and investment ratings may occur at any time.  

 Table 22  

 PRIVATELY ISSUED MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE (a)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

  (a)    All information is as of December 31, 2009.   

 Due to the severe disruption in the credit markets during the second half of 2008 and continuing in 2009, trading activity for privately issued mortgage-backed securities was dramatically reduced. In estimating values for such securities, the Company was significantly restricted in the level of market observable assumptions used in the valuation of its privately issued mortgage-backed securities portfolio. Because of the inactivity and the lack of observable valuation inputs, the Company transferred $2.2 billion of its privately issued mortgage-backed securities portfolio from Level 2 to Level 3 valuations in the third quarter of 2008. The remaining portion of its portfolio of privately issued mortgage-backed securities had already been classified as Level 3. To assist in the determination of fair value for its privately issued mortgage-backed securities, the Company engaged two independent pricing sources at December 31, 2009 and 2008. In determining fair value of those securities at December 31, 2008, in general, the Company averaged the results obtained from the independent sources. In April 2009, new accounting guidance was provided for estimating fair value when the volume and level of trading activity for an asset    

 81   
 or liability have significantly decreased. In consideration of the new guidance, the Company performed internal modeling to estimate the cash flows and fair value of 148 of its privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis of $1.9 billion at December 31, 2009. The Companys internal modeling techniques included discounting estimated bond-specific cash flows using assumptions about cash flows associated with loans underlying each of the bonds. In estimating those cash flows, the Company used conservative assumptions as to future delinquency, default and loss rates in order to mitigate exposure that might be attributable to the risk that actual future credit losses could exceed assumed credit losses. Differences between internal model valuations and external pricing indications were generally considered to be reflective of the lack of liquidity in the market for privately issued mortgage-backed securities. To determine the most representative fair value for each of the 148 bonds under current market conditions, the Company computed values based on judgmentally applied weightings of the internal model valuations and the indications obtained from the average of the two independent pricing sources. Weightings applied to internal model valuations were generally dependent on bond structure and collateral type, with prices for bonds in non-senior tranches generally receiving lower weightings on the internal model results and greater weightings of the valuation data provided by the independent pricing sources. As a result, certain valuations of privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities were determined by reference to independent pricing sources without adjustment. The average weight placed on internal model valuations was 37%, compared with a 63% weighting on valuations provided by the independent sources. Generally, the range of weights placed on internal valuations was between 0% and 40%. The impact of relying on the guidance provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and using an internal valuation modeling technique was to increase accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2009 by $72 million ($118 million pre-tax). Further information concerning the Companys valuations of privately issued mortgage-backed securities can be found in note 20 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 During 2009 the Company recognized $138 million (pre-tax) of other-than-temporary impairment losses related to privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $486 million and securities backed largely by trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $8 million. Those other-than-temporary impairment losses were determined in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, reflect the estimated credit losses on the impaired securities. In assessing impairment losses, the Company performed internal modeling to estimate bond-specific cash flows, which considered the placement of the bond in the overall securitization structure and the remaining levels of subordination. For privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities, the model utilized assumptions about the underlying performance of the mortgage loan collateral considering recent collateral performance and future assumptions regarding default and loss severity. At December 31, 2009, projected model default percentages on the underlying mortgage loan collateral ranged from 2% to 42% and loss severities ranged from 10% to 71%. For bonds in which the Company has recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge, the weighted-average percentage of defaulted collateral was 24% and the weighted-average loss severity was 49%. For bonds without other-than-temporary impairment losses, the weighted-average default percentage and loss severity were 12% and 38%, respectively. Underlying mortgage loan collateral cash flows, after considering the impact of estimated credit losses, were distributed by the model to the various securities within the securitization structure to determine the timing and extent of losses at the bond-level, if any. The other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in the consolidated statement of income were net of $126 million of unrealized losses for the same securities resulting from other factors that have been reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. Despite rising levels of delinquencies and losses in the underlying residential mortgage loan collateral, given credit enhancements resulting from the structures of individual bonds, the Company has concluded that as of December 31, 2009 its remaining privately issued mortgage-backed securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired. Nevertheless, given recent market conditions, it is possible that adverse changes in repayment performance and fair value could occur in 2010 and later years that could impact the Companys conclusions. Management has modeled cash flows from privately issued mortgage-backed securities under various scenarios and has concluded that even if home price depreciation and current delinquency trends persist for an extended period of time, the Companys principal losses on its privately    

 82   
 issued mortgage-backed securities would be substantially less than their current fair valuation losses. During 2008 the Company recognized $182 million (pre-tax) of other-than-temporary losses, $18 million of which related to privately issued mortgage-backed securities with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $20 million and $11 million related to securities backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions with an amortized cost basis (before impairment charge) of $12 million. As previously noted, the remaining $153 million of other-than-temporary impairment in 2008 related to the Companys holdings of preferred stock of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  

 Given the Companys relationship with Bayview Financial and related entities, during the third quarter of 2008, the Company reconsidered its intention to hold certain CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial with a cost basis of $385 million and a fair value of $298 million and transferred such securities from its available-for-sale investment securities portfolio to its held-to-maturity investment securities portfolio. As a result, at December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company had in its held-to-maturity portfolio CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial with an amortized cost basis of $352 million and $412 million, respectively, (including the effect of $68 million and $82 million, respectively, of unamortized fair value adjustment (pre-tax) residing in accumulated other comprehensive income from the time of transfer) and a fair value of $201 million and $319 million, respectively. At December 31, 2009, the amortized cost and fair value of CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio were $33 million and $25 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2008 were $40 million and $32 million, respectively. Given the credit enhancements within each of the individual bond structures, the Company has determined that, despite rising levels of delinquencies and losses in the underlying residential and commercial mortgage loan collateral, it expects to fully collect its contractual principal and interest payments on the private CMOs securitized by Bayview Financial and therefore believes such securities were not other-than-temporarily impaired at December 31, 2009.  

 At December 31, 2009, the Company also had net pre-tax unrealized losses of $29 million on $384 million of trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions, securities backed by trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions and other entities, and other debt securities (including $12 million of net unrealized gains on $115 million of securities using a Level 3 valuation and $41 million of net unrealized losses on $268 million of securities classified as Level 2 valuations). Pre-tax unrealized losses of $90 million existed on $241 million of such securities at December 31, 2008. After evaluating the expected repayment performance of financial institutions where trust preferred securities were held directly by the Company or were within the CDOs backed by trust preferred securities obtained in the Provident and Partners Trust acquisitions, the Company, during 2009 and 2008, recognized pre-tax other-than-temporary impairment losses of $8 million and $11 million, respectively, on securities obtained in the Partners Trust acquisition.  

 Following the U.S. Governments placement of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under conservatorship on September 7, 2008, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $153 million (pre-tax) on its preferred stock holdings of those government-sponsored entities. At December 31, 2009, the Companys investment in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock had a remaining cost basis of $9 million and a fair value of $6 million. The Company recognized a $127 million (pre-tax) other-than-temporary impairment charge in 2007 resulting from the decline in fair value of certain CDOs backed by sub-prime mortgage securities held in the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio based on its evaluation at the time that it was probable that the Company would not receive all payments owed to it under the terms and structure of the securities.  

 As of December 31, 2009, based on a review of each of the remaining securities in the investment securities portfolio, the Company concluded that it expected to recover its amortized cost basis for such securities. Accordingly, the Company concluded that the declines in the values of those securities were temporary and that additional other-than-temporary impairment charges were not appropriate at December 31, 2009. As of that date, the Company did not intend to sell nor is it anticipated that it would be required to sell any of its impaired securities, that is, where fair value is less than the cost basis of the security. The Company intends to closely monitor the performance of the privately issued mortgage-backed securities and other securities to assess if changes in their underlying credit performance or other events cause the cost basis of those securities to become other-than-temporarily impaired. However, because the unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities have generally already    

 83   
 been reflected in the financial statement values for investment securities and stockholders equity, any recognition of an other-than-temporary decline in value of those investment securities would not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition. Any other-than-temporary impairment charge related to held-to-maturity securities would result in reductions in the financial statement values for investment securities and stockholders equity. Additional information concerning fair value measurements and the Companys approach to the classification of such measurements is included in note 20 of the Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2009 was a net gain of $1 million, or $.01 per common share, and at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were net losses of $6 million or $.05 per common share and $10 million or $.09 per common share, respectively, representing unrealized gains or losses related to the termination of interest rate swap agreements that had been designated as cash flow hedges.  

 Adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, net of applicable tax effect, reduced accumulated other comprehensive income by $117 million, or $.99 per common share, at December 31, 2009, $174 million, or $1.58 per common share, at December 31, 2008, and $46 million, or $.42 per common share, at December 31, 2007. The decrease in such adjustment at December 31, 2009 as compared with December 31, 2008 was predominantly the result of actual investment performance of assets held by the Companys qualified pension plans being significantly better than assumed for actuarial purposes. Conversely, the increase in such adjustment at the 2008 year-end as compared with December 31, 2007 was predominantly the result of actual investment performance of pension plan assets being significantly worse than that assumed for actuarial purposes. Information about the funded status of the Companys pension and other postretirement benefit plans is included in note 12 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Cash dividends declared on M&Ts common stock totaled $327 million in 2009, compared with $309 million and $282 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. M&T increased the quarterly dividend on its common stock in the third quarter of 2007 from $.60 to $.70 per share. Dividends per common share totaled $2.80 in each of 2009 and 2008, and $2.60 in 2007. During 2009, cash dividends of $27 million, or $44.72 per share, were declared and paid to the U.S. Treasury on M&Ts Series A Preferred Stock issued on December 23, 2008. Cash dividends of $1 million and $4 million ($50.00 per share and $25.00 per share) were declared and paid during 2009 on M&Ts Series B and Series C Preferred Stock, respectively. Those series of preferred stock were created in connection with the Provident transaction.  

 M&T repurchased 4,514,800 shares of its common stock in 2007 at a cost of $509 million. There were no common stock repurchases by M&T in 2009 or 2008. In February 2007, M&T announced that it had been authorized by its Board of Directors to purchase up to 5,000,000 shares of its common stock. M&T had repurchased a total of 2,818,500 shares of common stock pursuant to such plan at an average cost of $108.30 per share.  

 Federal regulators generally require banking institutions to maintain Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios of at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of risk-adjusted total assets. In addition to the risk-based measures, Federal bank regulators have also implemented a minimum leverage ratio guideline of 3% of the quarterly average of total assets. As of December 31, 2009, Tier 1 capital included $1.1 billion of the trust preferred securities described in note 9 of Notes to Financial Statements. Total capital further included $1.6 billion of subordinated notes. The capital ratios of the Company and its banking subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 are presented in note 23 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 Fourth Quarter Results  

 Net income aggregated $137 million during the fourth quarter of 2009, up 34% from $102 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted and basic earnings per common share were $1.04 and $1.05, respectively, in the final quarter of 2009, 13% and 14% higher than $.92 of diluted and basic earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 2008. The annualized rates of return on average assets and average common stockholders equity for the fourth quarter of 2009 were .79% and 7.09%, respectively, compared with .63% and 6.41%, respectively, in the year-earlier period.  

 Net operating income totaled $151 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $112 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share were $1.16 in    

 84   
 the recent quarter, compared with $1.00 in the final quarter of 2008. The annualized net operating returns on average tangible assets and average tangible common equity in the last quarter of 2009 were .92% and 16.73%, respectively, compared with .72% and 15.01%, respectively, in the corresponding 2008 quarter. Core deposit and other intangible asset amortization, after tax effect, totaled $10 million in each of the fourth quarters of 2009 and 2008 ($.09 and $.08 per diluted common share, respectively). The after-tax impact of merger-related expenses associated with the Provident and Bradford acquisition transactions was $4 million ($6 million pre-tax) or $.03 of diluted earnings per common share in the fourth quarter of 2009. There were no merger-related expenses during the final quarter of 2008. Reconciliations of GAAP results with non-GAAP results for the quarterly periods of 2009 and 2008 are provided in table 24.  

 Taxable-equivalent net interest income rose 15% to $565 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 from $491 million in the year-earlier quarter. That improvement reflects a 34 basis point widening of the Companys net interest margin and higher average earning assets, which increased $2.5 billion, or 4%, to $60.5 billion from $57.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. The yield on earning assets was 4.58% in the fourth quarter of 2009, down 77 basis points from 5.35% in the year-earlier quarter. The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was 1.13% in the final quarter of 2009, 119 basis points lower than 2.32% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The resulting net interest spread was 3.45% in the recent quarter, up 42 basis points from 3.03% in the corresponding quarter of 2008. That improvement was largely due to lower interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings. The contribution of net interest-free funds to the Companys net interest margin was .26% in the final 2009 quarter, down from .34% in the year-earlier quarter. That decline reflects the impact of lower interest rates on interest-bearing liabilities used to value such contribution. As a result, the Companys net interest margin widened to 3.71% in the recent quarter from 3.37% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The major contributor to the growth experienced in average earning assets in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared with the year-earlier quarter was an increase in average loans and leases, which rose 7% to $52.1 billion from $48.8 billion. Included in average loans and leases in the recent quarter were loans obtained in the acquisition of Provident, which added approximately $3.8 billion to the average loan and lease total. In addition, loans obtained in the Bradford transaction added approximately $268 million to average loans and leases in the final quarter of 2009. Average commercial loan and lease balances were $13.5 billion in the recent quarter, compared with $14.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. Commercial real estate loans averaged $21.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009, up $2.3 billion from $18.7 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Average residential mortgage loans outstanding increased $553 million to $5.5 billion in the recent quarter from $4.9 billion in the final 2008 quarter. Consumer loans averaged $12.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2009, up $1.1 billion from $11.0 billion in the year-earlier quarter.  

 The provision for credit losses was $145 million in the three-month period ended December 31, 2009, compared with $151 million in the year-earlier period. Net charge-offs of loans were $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2009, representing an annualized 1.03% of average loans and leases outstanding, compared with $144 million or 1.17% during the final quarter of 2008. Net charge-offs included: residential real estate loans of $21 million in the recent quarter, compared with $19 million a year earlier; loans to builders and developers of residential properties of $40 million, compared with $26 million a year earlier; other commercial real estate loans of $11 million, compared with $3 million in 2008s final quarter; commercial loans of $31 million, compared with $61 million in 2008; and consumer loans of $32 million, compared with $35 million in the prior year fourth quarter.  

 Other income totaled $266 million in the recent quarter, up 10% from $241 million in the year-earlier quarter. Other-than-temporary impairment charges aggregated $34 million during the fourth quarter of 2009, compared with $24 million in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding those charges, other income was $300 million, up 13% from $265 million in the year-earlier quarter. The most significant contributors to that improvement were increases in mortgage banking revenues and service charges on acquisition-related deposit accounts.  

 Other expense in the fourth quarter of 2009 totaled $478 million, compared with $447 million in the year-earlier quarter. Included in such amounts are expenses considered to be nonoperating in nature consisting of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets of $17 million and $16 million in the final quarters of 2009 and 2008, respectively, and merger-related expenses of $6 million    

 85   
 in the fourth quarter of 2009. Exclusive of these nonoperating expenses, noninterest operating expenses were $455 million in the recently completed quarter, up 6% from $431 million in the final quarter of 2008. As compared with the fourth quarter of 2008, the recent quarters rise in operating expenses was due, in large part, to the operations obtained in the 2009 acquisition transactions and higher FDIC deposit assessments, partially offset by the impact of changes in the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. A partial reversal of the valuation allowance reduced expense by $4 million in the final quarter of 2009, compared with an addition to the valuation allowance in the year-earlier quarter which increased expense by $19 million. The Companys efficiency ratio during the fourth quarter of 2009 and 2008 was 52.7% and 57.0%, respectively. Table 24 includes a reconciliation of other expense to noninterest operating expense for each of the quarters of 2009 and 2008.  

 Segment Information  

 In accordance with GAAP, the Companys reportable segments have been determined based upon its internal profitability reporting system, which is organized by strategic business unit. Certain strategic business units have been combined for segment information reporting purposes where the nature of the products and services, the type of customer, and the distribution of those products and services are similar. The reportable segments are Business Banking, Commercial Banking, Commercial Real Estate, Discretionary Portfolio, Residential Mortgage Banking, and Retail Banking.  

 The financial information of the Companys segments was compiled utilizing the accounting policies described in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements. The management accounting policies and processes utilized in compiling segment financial information are highly subjective and, unlike financial accounting, are not based on authoritative guidance similar to GAAP. As a result, reported segments and the financial information of the reported segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information reported by other financial institutions. Furthermore, changes in management structure or allocation methodologies and procedures may result in changes in reported segment financial data. Financial information about the Companys segments is presented in note 22 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 The Business Banking segment provides a wide range of services to small businesses and professionals through the Companys branch network, business banking centers and other delivery channels such as telephone banking, Internet banking and automated teller machines within markets served by the Company. Services and products offered by this segment include various business loans and leases, including loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration, business credit cards, deposit products, and financial services such as cash management, payroll and direct deposit, merchant credit card and letters of credit. The Business Banking segment recorded net income of $124 million in 2009, 3% higher than the $120 million earned in 2008. The rise in net income in 2009 as compared with 2008 was due to higher net interest income of $33 million, largely attributable to higher average deposit and loan balances of $869 million and $416 million, respectively, partially offset by a $20 million increase in total noninterest expenses, reflecting higher FDIC deposit assessments of $10 million, and an $8 million increase in the provision for credit losses, the result of higher net charge-offs of loans. Approximately three-fourths of the higher net interest income was due to the Provident transaction. This segments net income totaled $133 million in 2007. The 10% decline in net income in 2008 as compared with 2007 was mainly due to a $15 million increase in the provision for credit losses, the result of higher net loan charge-offs, and higher noninterest expenses of $12 million, reflecting increased personnel costs. Those unfavorable factors were partially offset by a $5 million rise in service charges on deposit accounts.  

 The Commercial Banking segment provides a wide range of credit products and banking services for middle-market and large commercial customers, mainly within the markets served by the Company. Services provided by this segment include commercial lending and leasing, letters of credit, deposit products, and cash management services. The Commercial Banking segment contributed net income of $239 million in 2009, up 12% from $213 million in 2008. The higher net income in 2009 as compared with 2008 reflects a $98 million increase in net interest income, primarily due to a $3.0 billion increase in average deposit balances. Approximately 15 percent of the increase in net interest income was due to the Provident acquisition. Partially offsetting that increase were a $31 million increase in the provision for credit losses, predominately due to higher net charge-offs of loans, and a $15 million rise in FDIC deposit assessments. Net income earned in 2007 by the Commercial Banking segment was $217 million.    

 86   
 Contributing to the slight decline in net income in 2008 as compared with 2007 was a $65 million increase in the provision for credit losses, due to higher net charge-offs of loans, and higher noninterest expenses of $22 million, largely the result of increased personnel costs. Those factors were offset by a $51 million rise in net interest income, primarily the result of a $2.0 billion increase in average loan balances outstanding, and a $28 million increase in noninterest income resulting from higher fees of $14 million for providing credit-related services, a $9 million increase in fees earned for providing deposit account services, and a $3 million increase in income from providing credit card and merchant-related services.  

 The Commercial Real Estate segment provides credit and deposit services to its customers. Real estate securing loans in this segment is generally located in the New York City metropolitan area, upstate New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the northwestern portion of the United States. Commercial real estate loans may be secured by apartment/multifamily buildings; office, retail and industrial space; or other types of collateral. Activities of this segment also include the origination, sales and servicing of commercial real estate loans through the Fannie Mae DUS program and other programs. The Commercial Real Estate segments net income declined 5% to $155 million in 2009 from $164 million in 2008. Contributing to that decline were a $69 million increase in the provision for credit losses, primarily due to higher net charge-offs of loans, and higher noninterest expenses of $15 million, including increased deposit assessments of $4 million. Partially offsetting those increased costs was higher net interest income of $59 million. The increase in net interest income was largely attributable to higher average loan and deposit balances of $1.4 billion and $489 million, respectively, and an 18 basis point widening of the net interest margin on loans. Approximately one-half of the increase in net interest income was due to the Provident acquisition. Net income for the Commercial Real Estate segment aggregated $148 million in 2007. As compared with 2007, the improvement in 2008 was due to a $31 million increase in net interest income, largely the result of higher average loan and deposit balances of $1.8 billion and $189 million, respectively, and a $13 million increase in commercial mortgage banking revenues. Those positive factors were partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses of $11 million, mainly due to higher net charge-offs of loans, and a rise in personnel costs of $10 million, due largely to higher incentive compensation.  

 The Discretionary Portfolio segment includes investment and trading securities, residential mortgage loans and other assets; short-term and long-term borrowed funds; brokered certificates of deposit and interest rate swap agreements related thereto; and offshore branch deposits. This segment also provides foreign exchange services to customers. Included in the assets of the Discretionary Portfolio segment are the investment securities for which the Company has recognized other-than-temporary impairment charges in each of the last three years and the portfolio of Alt-A mortgage loans. The Discretionary Portfolio segment incurred net losses of $28 million, $48 million and $7 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Included in those results were other-than-temporary impairment charges of $138 million in 2009, $182 million in 2008 and $127 million in 2007. The impairment charges recorded in 2009 were related to private CMOs and CDOs backed by residential mortgages ($130 million) and CDOs backed by trust preferred securities ($8 million). The 2008 impairment charges were related to the Companys holdings of preferred stock issuances of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ($153 million), private CMOs ($18 million) and CDOs backed by trust preferred securities ($11 million). The impairment charges recorded in 2007 related entirely to CDOs backed by sub-prime residential mortgage securities. All of the impairment charges relate to bonds or preferred stock held in the Companys available-for-sale investment securities portfolio. Factors contributing to the lower net loss in 2009 as compared with 2008 were a $44 million decline in other-than-temporary impairment charges, the impact of a partial reversal of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights of $6 million in 2009, compared with an addition to the valuation allowance of $6 million in 2008, and lower foreclosure-related costs of $10 million. Those factors were partially offset by a $14 million increase in the provision for credit losses, driven by higher net charge-offs, and a $7 million decline in net interest income, reflecting lower average balances of investment securities and loans of $529 million and $290 million, respectively. The Discretionary Portfolio segments higher net loss in 2008 as compared with 2007 was due, in part, to the following unfavorable factors: higher other-than-temporary impairment charges of $55 million; an increase in the provision for credit losses of $41 million, resulting largely from higher net    

 87   
 charge-offs of Alt-A loans; higher foreclosure-related costs of $13 million; a $6 million increase in the valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights; and a rise in costs incurred for professional services of $4 million. Partially offsetting those unfavorable factors were a $55 million increase in net interest income, largely resulting from a 21 basis point widening of the net interest margin on investment securities and a 23% increase in the average balances of investment securities, reflecting purchases of residential mortgage-backed securities during the first quarter of 2008 and the full-year impact of third quarter 2007 purchases of approximately $800 million of CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities.  

 The Residential Mortgage Banking segment originates and services residential mortgage loans and sells substantially all of those loans in the secondary market to investors or to the Discretionary Portfolio segment. This segment also originated loans to developers of residential real estate properties, although that activity has been significantly curtailed. In addition to the geographic regions served by or contiguous with the Companys branch network, the Company maintains mortgage loan origination offices in several states throughout the western United States. The Company also periodically purchases the rights to service mortgage loans. Residential mortgage loans held for sale are included in this segment. This segment incurred net losses of $13 million and $48 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, reflecting significant losses on loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. The lower net loss in 2009 resulted from the following factors: a $55 million rise in noninterest revenues from residential mortgage loan origination activities due to increased volume and wider margins; the impact of a partial reversal of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance of $16 million in 2009, compared with a $10 million addition to such allowance in 2008; and a $13 million increase in net interest income, partly due to a 68 basis point widening of the net interest margin on loans. Those factors were offset, in part, by a $43 million increase in total noninterest expenses (excluding the capitalized mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance reversal), reflecting higher foreclosure-related costs of $23 million. Compared with the net loss of $48 million in 2008, the Residential Mortgage Banking segment recorded net income of $13 million in 2007. The main factor that contributed to the net loss in 2008 was the continued deterioration of the residential real estate market, including the valuation of residential real estate, which resulted in a $100 million increase to the provision for credit losses that was predominately attributable to a significant rise in net charge-offs of loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. Also contributing to the unfavorable performance of this segment in 2008 was a $15 million decrease in net interest income, mainly due to lower average loan balances outstanding of $369 million and a 17 basis point narrowing of the net interest margin associated with such loans, and a $14 million increase in the valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights. Partially offsetting those factors was a $25 million increase in noninterest revenues from residential mortgage banking activities, reflecting the impact of $12 million of losses recorded in 2007 related to Alt-A mortgage loans and higher servicing revenues of $8 million in 2008.  

 The Retail Banking segment offers a variety of services to consumers through several delivery channels which include branch offices, automated teller machines, telephone banking and Internet banking. The Company has branch offices in New York State, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, the District of Columbia, West Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey. The Retail Banking segment also offers certain deposit products on a nationwide basis through the delivery channels of M&T Bank, N.A. Credit services offered by this segment include consumer installment loans, automobile loans (originated both directly and indirectly through dealers), and home equity loans and lines of credit. The segment also offers to its customers deposit products, including demand, savings and time accounts; investment products, including mutual funds and annuities; and other services. The Retail Banking segment contributed net income of $237 million in 2009, down 5% from the $250 million recorded in 2008. The following factors contributed to that decline: a $42 million increase in FDIC deposit assessments; a rise in the provision for credit losses of $32 million, resulting from higher net charge-offs of consumer loans; and increases in personnel and net occupancy costs of $17 million and $16 million, respectively, related to the operations added with the Provident acquisition. Those unfavorable factors were partially offset by a $48 million increase in net interest income and a $34 million rise in fees earned for providing deposit account services to Provident customers. The higher net interest income was due to a $2.4 billion increase in average deposit balances (approximately 60 percent of the increase in those balances was due to the impact of the Provident transaction) and a 26 basis point widening of the net interest margin on    

 88   
 loans, offset, in part, by a 26 basis point narrowing of the deposit net interest margin. Net income for this segment in 2008 was 21% lower than the $316 million earned in 2007. That decline resulted from increases in: the provision for credit losses of $38 million, mainly due to higher net charge-offs of loans; personnel costs of $22 million, reflecting merit increases and the impact of the late-2007 acquisitions; net occupancy expenses of $12 million, largely the result of the 2007 acquisitions; and higher advertising and promotion costs of $6 million. Another contributing factor in the decline in net income was lower net interest income of $19 million, largely attributable to the narrowing of the net interest margins on deposits and loans of 34 basis points and 14 basis points, respectively, partially offset by the impact of higher average deposit and loan balances of $1.5 billion and $979 million, respectively.  

 The All Other category reflects other activities of the Company that are not directly attributable to the reported segments. Reflected in this category are the amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of financial institutions, M&Ts equity in the earnings (loss) of BLG, merger-related gains and expenses resulting from acquisitions and the net impact of the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with the earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments and the provision for credit losses. The various components of the All Other category resulted in net losses of $335 million, $95 million and $167 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Contributing to the higher net loss in 2009 as compared with 2008 were the following unfavorable factors: the impact from the Companys allocation methodologies for internal transfers for funding charges and credits associated with the earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities of the Companys reportable segments and the provision for credit losses; $89 million of merger-related expenses associated with the Provident and Bradford acquisitions recorded in 2009, compared with $4 million of merger-related expenses in 2008 related to acquisition transactions completed in the fourth quarter of 2007; Visa-related transactions that were recorded in the first quarter of 2008, including a $33 million gain realized from the mandatory partial redemption of Visa stock owned by M&T Bank and $15 million related to the reversal of Visa litigation-related accruals initially recorded in 2007s fourth quarter; increased personnel costs associated with the business and support units included in the All Other category of $35 million, including higher costs for medical, pension and post-retirement benefits; the impact of a $10 million reduction of income tax expense resulting from the reversal of taxes previously accrued for uncertain tax positions in various jurisdictions, compared with a $40 million reduction of income tax expense recorded in 2008s third quarter relating to M&Ts resolution of certain tax issues from its activities in various jurisdictions during the years 1999-2007; lower trust income of $28 million; a $16 million increase in FDIC deposit assessments; and a $6 million increase in charitable contributions made to the M&T Charitable Foundation. Partially offsetting those factors was the previously noted $29 million merger-related gain associated with the Bradford transaction in 2009 and a $13 million (pre-tax) improvement from M&Ts share of the operating results of BLG (inclusive of interest expense to fund that investment). The lower net loss recorded in 2008 as compared with 2007 resulted from several factors, including the previously mentioned $40 million reduction of income tax expense in 2008; the $33 million gain realized in the first quarter of 2008 from the mandatory partial redemption of Visa stock; the impact from the $23 million accrual recorded in the final quarter of 2007 related to Visa litigation and the subsequent $15 million partial reversal of such accrual in the first quarter of 2008; lower merger-related costs resulting from the 2007 acquisition transactions of $11 million; and the favorable impact from the Companys allocation methodologies for internal funds transfer pricing and the provision for credit losses. Those favorable factors were partially offset by a $32 million after-tax reduction in 2008 of the contribution from M&Ts investment in BLG, inclusive of interest expense to fund that investment, compared with a similar reduction in 2007 of $4 million; higher personnel and professional services costs of $15 million and $11 million, respectively, related to the business and support units included in the All Other category; and contributions to The M&T Charitable Foundation that totaled $6 million.  

 Recent Accounting Developments  

 In January 2010, the FASB amended fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to require disclosure of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers and to require separate presentation of information about purchases, sales, issuances, and    

 89   
 settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements. The amended guidance also clarifies existing requirements that (i) fair value measurement disclosures should be disaggregated for each class of asset and liability and (ii) disclosures about valuation techniques and inputs for both recurring and nonrecurring Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements should be provided. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for the disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements in the roll forward of activity in Level 3 fair value measurements, which are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2010 and for interim periods within those years. The adoption of this guidance will not impact the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

 In June 2009, the FASB amended accounting guidance relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities to eliminate the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The amended guidance instead requires a reporting entity to qualitatively assess the determination of the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity based on whether the reporting entity has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entitys economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. The amended guidance requires ongoing reassessments of whether the reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. The amended guidance is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. Earlier adoption is prohibited.  

 In June 2009, the FASB also issued amended accounting guidance relating to accounting for transfers of financial assets to eliminate the exceptions for qualifying special purpose entities from the consolidation guidance and the exception that permitted sale accounting for certain mortgage securitizations when a transferor has not surrendered control over the transferred assets. The amended guidance is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after November 15, 2009, for interim periods within that first annual reporting period, and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The recognition and measurement provisions of the amended guidance should be applied to transfers that occur on or after the effective date. Additionally, on and after the effective date, the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity will no longer be relevant for accounting purposes. Therefore, formerly qualifying special-purpose entities will be evaluated for consolidation on and after the effective date in accordance with applicable consolidation guidance, including the new accounting guidance relating to the consolidation of variable interest entities discussed in the previous paragraph.  

 Effective January 1, 2010, the Company includes in its consolidated financial statements one-to-four family residential mortgage loans that were included in two separate non-recourse securitization transactions using qualified special trusts. The effect of that consolidation was to increase loans receivable by $424 million, decrease the amortized cost of available-for-sale investment securities by $360 million (fair value of $355 million), and increase borrowings by $65 million. Information concerning these securitization transactions is included in note 19 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued a revision of the business combinations accounting standard. The revised guidance retains the fundamental requirements of the previous accounting standard that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination. The revised accounting guidance defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date the acquirer achieves control. The revised accounting guidance retains the provisions in the previous accounting standard for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill. With limited exceptions, the revised guidance requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair value as of that date. That replaces the previous accounting standards cost-allocation process, which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. As a result, certain acquisition-related costs previously included in the cost of an acquisition are now required to be expensed as    

 90   
 incurred. In addition, certain restructuring costs previously recognized as if they were an assumed liability from an acquisition are also required to be expensed. The revised accounting guidance also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages (sometimes referred to as a step acquisition) to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities, as well as the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, at the full amounts of their fair values. The revised accounting guidance requires an acquirer to recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date measured as a residual, which in most types of business combinations will result in measuring goodwill as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. The revised accounting guidance also eliminates the recognition of a separate valuation allowance, such as an allowance for credit losses, as of the acquisition date for assets acquired in a business combination that are measured at their acquisition-date fair values because the effects of uncertainty about future cash flows should be included in the fair value measurement of those assets. The revised accounting guidance must be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. Earlier adoption is prohibited. The adoption of the revised accounting guidance significantly impacts the accounting for acquisitions consummated in 2009 and beyond, including the Companys acquisition of Provident in a stock-for-stock transaction, which was completed on May 23, 2009, and the FDIC-assisted Bradford transaction, which was completed on August 28, 2009. Information concerning the Provident and Bradford transactions is included in note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.  

 In April 2009, the FASB issued amended accounting rules relating to the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies to amend and clarify the business combination accounting standard to address application issues with respect to initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. This guidance applies to all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies, except for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies that are subject to specific provisions in the business combinations accounting rules. The accounting guidance requires an acquirer to recognize at fair value, at the acquisition date, an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency if the acquisition-date fair value of that asset or liability can be determined during the measurement period. If the acquisition-date fair value of an asset acquired or a liability assumed in a business combination that arises from a contingency cannot be determined during the measurement period, an asset or liability shall be recognized if it is probable that an asset existed or that a liability had been incurred at the acquisition date and the amount of the asset or liability can be reasonably estimated. An acquirer shall develop a rational basis for subsequently measuring and accounting for assets and liabilities arising from contingencies depending on their nature. This accounting guidance is effective for assets or liabilities arising from contingencies in business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008. The Company applied the guidance in accounting for the aforementioned Provident and Bradford transactions completed during the 2009 second and third quarters, respectively. Information concerning the Provident and Bradford acquisitions is included in note 2 of Notes to Financial Statements.
