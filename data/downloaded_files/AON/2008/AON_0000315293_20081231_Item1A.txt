Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

 The following are certain risks related to our business specifically and the insurance industry generally that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risk factors are:   

Our results may fluctuate due to many factors, including cyclical or permanent changes in the insurance and reinsurance industries.   

 Our results have historically been subject to significant fluctuations arising from uncertainties and changes in the insurance industry. Changes in premium rates generally affect the commissions and fees earned by our brokerage businesses.   

Our results may be adversely affected by changes in the mode of compensation in the insurance industry.   

 Since the Attorney General of New York brought charges against one of our competitors in 2004, there has been a great deal of uncertainty concerning then longstanding methods of compensating insurance brokers. Soon after the Attorney General brought those charges, Aon and certain other large insurance brokers announced that they would terminate contingent commission arrangements with underwriters. Most other insurance brokers, however, continue to enter into such arrangements, and regulators have not taken action to end such arrangements throughout the industry. In July 2008, New York regulators held hearings on potential rules relating to compensation and disclosures. The outcome of these hearings could affect how we are compensated and how we disclose our compensation to clients.  

7 

Our results may be adversely affected by the impact that disruptions in the credit and financial markets have on our customers and the insurance industry.   

 The recent disruptions in the global economy, the repricing of credit risk and the deterioration of the financial markets have created increasingly difficult conditions for financial institutions, including participants in the insurance industry. These conditions include significant losses, greater volatility, significantly less liquidity and widening of credit spreads. In recent months, such volatility has reached unprecedented levels. Continued volatility and further deterioration in the credit markets may reduce our customers' demand for our brokerage and reinsurance services and products, including increasing their levels of self-insurance. Other clients may be significantly impacted by credit pressures or other financial difficulties which could result in their insolvency. These events could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the potential for a significant insurer to fail or withdraw from writing certain insurance coverages that we offer our clients could negatively impact overall capacity in the industry, which could then reduce placement of certain lines and types of insurance and reduce our revenues and profitability. The potential for an insurer to fail could also result in errors and omissions claims by clients.  

 The current economic conditions have also created significant uncertainty in the industries our consulting operations participate in. A severe and/or prolonged economic downturn could hurt our clients' financial condition and the levels of business activities in the industries and geographies where we operate. These challenges may reduce demand for some of our services or depress pricing of those services and have an adverse effect on our new business and results of operations.   

We face significant competitive pressures in each of our businesses.   

 We believe that competition in our lines of business is based on service, product features, price, commission structure, financial strength and name recognition. In particular, we compete with a large number of national, regional and local insurance companies and other financial services providers and brokers.  

 We encounter strong competition for both clients and professional talent in our insurance brokerage and risk management services operations from other insurance brokerage firms which also operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms throughout the world, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants that provide risk related services and products. Our consulting operations compete with independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms around the world.  

 In addition, the increase in competition due to new legislative or industry developments could adversely affect us. These developments include:    

the selling of insurance by insurance companies directly to insureds;   

changes in our business compensation model as a result of regulatory actions or changes;   

the establishment of programs in which state sponsored entities provide property insurance in catastrophe prone areas or other alternative types of coverage;   

additional regulations promulgated by the FSA in the United Kingdom, or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which we operate.   

 New competition as a result of these developments could cause the supply of, and demand for, our products and services to change, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We may not realize all of the expected benefits from our restructuring plans.   

 In fourth quarter 2008, we announced a global restructuring plan (the "Aon Benfield Plan") in connection with our merger with Benfield. The restructuring plan, which will continue through the end of 2011, is intended to integrate and streamline operations across the combined Aon Benfield organization. The Aon Benfield Plan includes an estimated 500 to 700 job eliminations, the closing or consolidation of several offices, asset impairments and other expenses necessary to implement these initiatives. We estimate that the Aon Benfield Plan will result in cumulative costs totaling approximately $185 million over a three-year period, and that approximately $104 million of these costs will be included in the purchase price allocation, with the remainder being recorded in operations in future periods. We anticipate that our annualized savings from the Aon Benfield Plan will be approximately $122 million by 2011. We cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings.  

 In third quarter 2007, we announced a global restructuring plan intended to create a more streamlined organization and to reduce future expense growth to better serve clients (the "2007 Plan"). As a result, we have adopted restructuring initiatives that are expected to result in the elimination of an estimated 3,900 employee positions, the closing or consolidation of various offices, asset impairments and other expenses necessary to implement these initiatives. We currently expect that the 2007 Plan will result in cumulative pretax charges of $550 million. We anticipate that our annualized savings from the 2007 Plan will be approximately $370 million by 2010. We cannot assure that we will achieve the targeted savings.   

Changes in interest rates and deterioration of credit quality could reduce the value of our cash balances and investment portfolios and adversely affect our financial condition or results.   

 Operating funds available for corporate use and funds held on behalf of clients and insurers were $388 million and $3.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2008. These funds are held in cash, short-term investments, and in fiduciary assets. We also carry an investment portfolio of preferred stock and other long-term investments. As of December 31, 2008, these investments had a carrying value of $332 million. Changes in interest rates and counterparty credit quality could reduce the value of these funds and investments, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results. For example, changes in domestic and international interest rates directly affect our income from cash balances and short-term investments. Similarly, general economic conditions, stock market conditions and other factors beyond our control affect the value of our preferred stock and other long-term investments. We monitor our portfolio for other-than-temporary impairments in carrying value. For securities judged to have an other-than-temporary impairment, we write down the value of those securities and recognize a realized loss through the statement of income.   

Our pension obligations could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity.   

 To the extent that the present value of the benefits incurred to date for pension obligations for our major plans continue to exceed the value of the assets supporting those obligations, our financial position and results of operations may be adversely affected. In certain previous years, there have been declines in interest rates. As a result of lower interest rates, the present value of plan liabilities increased faster than the value of plan assets, resulting in significantly higher unfunded positions in several of our major pension plans.  

 We currently plan on contributing approximately $400 million to our major pension plans in 2009, although we may elect to contribute more. Total cash contributions to these pension plans in 2008 were $177 million, which was a decrease of $34 million from 2007.  

 The magnitude of our worldwide pension plans means that our earnings are comparatively sensitive to various market factors. These factors include equity and bond market returns, the assumed interest rates we use to discount our pension liabilities, foreign exchange rates, rates of inflation, mortality assumptions, potential regulatory and legal changes and counterparty exposure from various  

9 

investments including annuities. Variations in any of these factors could cause significant fluctuation in our earnings from year to year.  

 The periodic revision of pension assumptions can materially change the present value of future benefits, and therefore the funded status of the plans and resulting periodic pension expense. Changes in our pension benefit obligations and the related net periodic costs or credits may occur in the future due to any variance of actual results from our assumptions and changes in the number of participating employees. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will not experience future decreases in stockholders' equity, net income, cash flow and liquidity or that we will not be required to make additional cash contributions in the future beyond those which have been estimated.   

We are subject to a number of contingencies and legal proceedings which, if determined unfavorably to us, would adversely affect our financial results.   

 We are subject to numerous claims, tax assessments, lawsuits and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The damages claimed in these matters are or may be substantial, including, in many instances, claims for punitive, treble or extraordinary damages. We have purchased errors and omissions ("E&O") insurance and other appropriate insurance to provide protection against losses that arise in such matters. Accruals for these items, and related insurance receivables, when applicable, have been provided to the extent that losses are deemed probable and are reasonably estimable. These accruals and receivables are adjusted from time to time as developments warrant. Amounts related to settlement provisions are recorded in other general expenses in the consolidated statements of income.  

 At the time of the 2004-05 investigation of the insurance industry by the Attorney General of New York ("NYAG") and other regulators, purported classes of clients filed civil litigation against us and other companies under a variety of legal theories, including state tort, contract, fiduciary duty, antitrust and statutory theories and federal antitrust and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO") theories. The federal actions were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, and a state court collective action was filed in California. In the New Jersey actions, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' federal antitrust and RICO claims in separate orders in August and October 2007, respectively. Plaintiffs have appealed these dismissals. We believe we have meritorious defenses in all of these cases and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.  

 Also at the time of the NYAG investigation, putative classes filed actions against us in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois under the federal securities laws and ERISA. Plaintiffs in the federal securities class action have recently submitted purported expert reports estimating a range of alleged damages of $353 million to $490 million, and plaintiffs in the ERISA class actions have recently submitted purported expert reports estimating a range of alleged damages of $59 million to $349 million. In January 2009, we submitted our own expert reports, which concluded that plaintiffs' theories of liability and causation are meritless and that, in any event, plaintiffs incurred no damages. We believe we have meritorious defenses in all of these cases and intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims. The outcome of these lawsuits, and any losses or other payments that may occur as a result, cannot be predicted at this time.  

 Following inquiries from regulators, we commenced an internal review of our compliance with certain U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). An outside law firm with significant experience in the area is overseeing the review. Certain governmental agencies, including the U.K. Financial Services Authority ("FSA"), the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"), have also been investigating these matters. We are fully cooperating with these investigations, and have agreed with the U.S. agencies to toll any applicable statute of limitations pending completion of the investigations. On January 8, 2009, we and the FSA announced a settlement under which the FSA concluded its investigation by assessing a £5.25 million ($7.9 million) fine on Aon Limited, our principal U.K.  

10 

brokerage subsidiary, for failing to maintain effective systems and controls. Based on current information, we are unable to predict at this time when the remaining SEC and DOJ matters will be concluded, or what regulatory or other outcomes may result.  

 A financial institution in the U.K. called Standard Life Assurance Ltd. brought an action in London Commercial Court against us seeking more than £50 million ($73 million at December 31, 2008 exchange rates) for alleged errors or omissions in the placement of a professional indemnity policy with certain underwriters. In a preliminary decision issued on February 13, 2008, the court construed the relevant policy language to excuse the underwriters from paying Standard Life and concluded that we were negligent in not seeking changes to the language. We filed an interlocutory appeal of this preliminary decision. In July 2008, we reached a settlement with the underwriters under which the underwriters agreed to pay a portion of the ultimate recovery by Standard Life in exchange for us dropping our appeal of the preliminary decision. In subsequent proceedings in the Commercial Court, we will vigorously contest Standard Life's claims based on a variety of legal and factual arguments. We have a potential negligence claim against a different third party which provided advice with respect to the relevant policy language, and we further believe that, as a result of an indemnity given to us by a third party, we are entitled to indemnification in whole or part for any losses in this matter.  

 A putative class action, Buckner v. Resource Life, is pending in state court in Columbus, Georgia against a former subsidiary, Resource Life Insurance Company. The complaint alleges that Resource Life, which wrote policies insuring repayment of auto loans, was obligated to identify and return unearned premium to policyholders whose loans terminated before the end of their scheduled terms. In connection with the sale of Resource Life in 2006, we agreed to indemnify Resource Life's buyer in certain respects relating to this action. We believe that Resource Life has meritorious defenses and are vigorously defending this action. The outcome of the action, and the amount of any losses or other payments that may result, cannot be predicted at this time.  

 Although the ultimate outcome of all matters referred to above cannot be ascertained, and liabilities in indeterminate amounts may be imposed on us or our subsidiaries, on the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of these matters.   

We are subject to E&O claims against us.   

 In our insurance brokerage and consulting businesses, we often assist our clients with matters which include the placement of insurance coverage or employee benefit plans and the handling of related claims. Errors and omission ("E&O') claims against us may allege our potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. E&O claims could include, for example, the failure of our employees or sub agents, whether negligently or intentionally, to place coverage correctly or notify carriers of claims on behalf of clients or to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information relating to the risks being insured. It is not always possible to prevent and detect errors and omissions, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. In addition, E&O claims may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating our business.   

Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel.   

 Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel, including brokers and other professional personnel. Competition for such experienced professional personnel is intense. If we cannot hire and retain talented personnel, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  

11 

Our businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth.   

 Our businesses are subject to extensive federal, state, and foreign governmental regulation and supervision, which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, limiting or restricting the products or services we sell or the methods by which we sell our products and services, or subjecting our businesses to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. With respect to our insurance brokerage businesses, this supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and third party administrators and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokering and third party administration in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions. Also, we can be affected indirectly by the governmental regulation and supervision of other insurance companies. For instance, if we are providing managing general underwriting services for an insurer, we may have to contend with regulations affecting our client. Further, regulation affecting the insurance companies with whom our brokers place business can affect how we conduct those operations.  

 Although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including employee benefit plan regulation, Medicare, age, race, disability and sex discrimination, investment company regulation, financial services regulation, securities laws and federal taxation, and the FCPA, do affect the insurance industry generally. For instance, several laws and regulations adopted by the federal government, including the Gramm Leach Bliley Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, have created additional administrative and compliance requirements for us.  

 With respect to our international operations, we are subject to various regulations relating to, among other things, licensing, currency, policy language and terms, reserves and the amount of local investment. These various regulations also add to our cost of doing business through increased compliance expenses, the financial impact of use of capital restrictions and increased training and employee expenses. Furthermore, the loss of a license in a particular jurisdiction could restrict or eliminate our ability to conduct business in that jurisdiction.  

 In all jurisdictions the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our business can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past.   

Our significant global operations expose us to various international risks that could adversely affect our business.   

 A significant portion of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. Accordingly, we are subject to legal, economic and market risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:    

the general economic and political conditions existing in those countries;   

devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;   

imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries;   

imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;   

12 

difficulties in staffing and managing our foreign offices, and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal and compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;   

hyperinflation in certain foreign countries;   

imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments;   

longer payment cycles;   

greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection; and   

the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws.  

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that could negatively impact our financial results and cash flows.   

 Because a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. These exposures may change over time and they could have a material adverse impact on our financial results and cash flows. Our four biggest exposures in order of sensitivity are the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. As slightly more than half of our pretax income is non-U.S. Dollar denominated, we generally prefer a weaker U.S. Dollar versus the Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, with the Euro as our largest exposure at approximately 40% of pretax income. Offsetting our normal translation exposure is our transactional exposure between the U.S. Dollar revenue and Pound expense. In the U.K., part of our revenue is denominated in U.S. Dollars, although our operating expenses are in Pounds. Therefore, we prefer a stronger U.S. Dollar versus the Pound. Additionally, we have exposures to emerging market currencies, which can have extreme currency volatility. An increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the real cost to our customers in foreign markets where we receive our revenue in U.S. Dollars, and a weakened U.S. Dollar could potentially affect demand for our services.  

 Although we use various derivative financial instruments to help protect against adverse transaction and translation effects due to exchange rate fluctuations, we cannot eliminate such risks, and significant changes in exchange rates may adversely affect our results.   

Our financial results could be adversely affected if assumptions used in establishing our underwriting reserves differ from actual experience.   

 We maintain claims reserves as an estimate of our liability under insurance policies issued by our remaining property and casualty insurance underwriting operations, which are currently in runoff and are expected to be sold in 2009. These reserves could cause variability in our financial results.  

 Claim reserves reflect our estimated liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses, including legal and other fees and general expenses for administering the claims adjustment process, and for reported and unreported losses incurred as of the end of each accounting period. If the reserves, as currently estimated for future claims, prove inadequate, we would be required to increase our liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  

 The obligation for future claims does not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent our management's best estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost. These estimates represent informed judgments based on our assessment of currently available data, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial and legal developments and legislative changes, can cause our estimates to vary. The inherent uncertainty of estimating reserves is greater for certain types of liabilities, where the variables affecting these types of claims are subject to change and long periods of time may elapse before a definitive  

13 

determination of liability is made. Reserve estimates are periodically refined as experience develops and further losses are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed. Because setting the level of claims reserves is inherently uncertain, we cannot assure investors that our current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.   

Each of our business lines may be adversely affected by an overall decline in economic activity.   

 The demand for property and casualty insurance generally rises as the overall level of economic activity increases and generally falls as such activity decreases, affecting both the commissions and fees generated by our brokerage and consulting businesses. In particular, a growing number of insolvencies associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of clients or by hampering our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business. Moreover, the results of our consulting business are generally affected by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these clients serve. As our clients become adversely affected by declining business conditions, they may choose to delay or forgo consulting engagements with Aon.   

We have debt outstanding that could adversely affect our financial flexibility.   

 As of December 31, 2008, we had total consolidated debt outstanding of approximately $2.0 billion. The level of debt outstanding could adversely affect our financial flexibility.  

 We have two primary committed credit facilities outstanding, one for our U.S. operations, the other for our European operations. The U.S. facility totals $600 million and matures in February 2010. It is intended as a back-up against commercial paper, source for letters of credit, or to address capital needs in times of extreme liquidity pressure. At year end 2008 there was $580 million of available borrowing capacity off of the facility. The Euro facility totals €650 million ($912 million at December 31, 2008 exchange rates) and matures in October 2010. It is intended as a revolving working capital line for our European operations. At year end 2008 there was €219 million ($307 million) of available borrowing capacity off of the facility. Both facilities require certain representations and warrants be made before drawing and both have the same two financial covenants. The representations and warrants are standard for agreements of this type and include such things as: compliance with laws and contracts, timely filing of taxes, and insurance licenses in good standing. For both the U.S. and Euro facilities, we are required to maintain a ratio of consolidated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) to consolidated interest expense of 4 to 1 and a ratio of consolidated debt to EBITDA of not greater than 3 to 1. At year end 2008, we could make all representations and warrants and were within our financial covenants.   

A decline in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper may adversely affect our borrowing costs and financial flexibility.   

 A downgrade in the credit ratings of our senior debt and commercial paper could increase our borrowing costs and reduce our financial flexibility. There are ratings triggers in our U.S., U.K. and Canada Cananwill facilities. The U.S. Cananwill agreement requires that if our senior unsecured debt rating were to become lower than BBB- (Standard & Poors) or Baa3 (Moody's Investor Services), the agreement could be terminated whereby cash flows related to the receivables in the facility must be utilized to pay down the outstanding balance of the program; moreover, no additional receivables can be sold into the facility. The same applies to the Canadian Facility except our senior unsecured debt must be rated lower than BBB, and the Australian facility, where our senior unsecured debt rating must be rated lower than BBB+ or Baa1. The U.K. Facility requires Cananwill to find a new backup service provider within 90 days in the event our long term senior unsecured debt rating becomes lower than BBB- or Baa3. In the event we cannot obtain a backup service provider, the agreement could be terminated. Our senior debt ratings at December 31, 2008 were BBB+ and Baa2.  

14 

 A downgrade would increase our commercial paper interest rates or may result in our inability to access the commercial paper market altogether. We cannot assume that our financial position would not be adversely affected if we are unable to access the commercial paper market.   

Changes in our accounting estimates and assumptions could negatively affect our financial position and results.   

 We prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. We are also required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period. We periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to reserves to pay policy liabilities, income taxes, stock-based compensation and contingencies and litigation. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and changes in accounting standards could increase costs to our organization and could have an adverse impact on our future financial position and results of operations.   

We are a holding company and, therefore, may not be able to receive dividends in needed amounts from our subsidiaries.   

 Our principal assets are the shares of capital stock of our subsidiaries. We have to rely on dividends from these subsidiaries to meet our obligations for paying principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations and for paying dividends to stockholders and corporate expenses.   

We cannot guarantee that our reinsurers of our property and casualty business will pay in a timely fashion, if at all.   

 To better manage our portfolio of underwriting risk, we purchased reinsurance by transferring part of the risk (known as ceding) to reinsurance companies in exchange for part of the premium that we had received in connection with the risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred (or ceded) to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. Recently, due to industry and general economic conditions, there is an increasing risk of insolvency among reinsurance companies, resulting in a greater incidence of litigation and affecting the recoverability of claims. We cannot assure that our reinsurers will pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to us or that they will pay these recoverables on a timely basis.  

 In connection with the sale of Aon Warranty Group ("AWG") on November 30, 2006, we sold the capital stock of Virginia Surety Company ("VSC"). Because VSC issued property and casualty policies, VSC continues to remain liable to property and casualty policyholders. However, pursuant to contractual arrangements entered into as part of the sale of AWG, Aon has agreed to indemnify the buyer of VSC for obligations arising out of the property and casualty business, including a failure by reinsurers to meet their obligations with respect to the property and casualty business. We have also agreed to guarantee amounts owed by reinsurers in respect of the Construction Program Group ("CPG") business issued prior to the closing of that transaction. If reinsurers fail to pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to VSC with respect to the property and casualty business (including with respect to CPG business) or do not pay on a timely basis, we will be responsible for these amounts. In conjunction with the sale of our remaining property and casualty insurance underwriting operations, scheduled to be completed by mid 2009, the buyer will assume the responsibility if the reinsurers fail to pay the reinsurance recoverables owed to VSC with respect to the property and casualty business, including with respect to CPG insurers.  

15 

The occurrence of natural or man made disasters could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.   

 We are exposed to various risks arising out of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods and tornadoes, and pandemic health events such as avian influenza, as well as man-made disasters, including acts of terrorism and military actions. The continued threat of terrorism and ongoing military actions may cause significant volatility in global financial markets, and a natural or man-made disaster could trigger an economic downturn in the areas directly or indirectly affected by the disaster. These consequences could, among other things, result in a decline in business and increased claims from those areas. Disasters also could disrupt public and private infrastructure, including communications and financial services, which could disrupt our normal business operations.  

 A natural or man-made disaster also could disrupt the operations of our counterparties or result in increased prices for the products and services they provide to us. In addition, a disaster could adversely affect the value of the assets in our investment portfolio if it affects companies' ability to pay principal or interest on their securities. Finally, a natural or man-made disaster could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims against us.  

 Through our merger with Benfield, we acquired two variable interest entities that we consolidate, Globe Re Limited ("Globe Re") and Juniperus Insurance Opportunities Fund Limited ("Juniperus"), because we are the primary beneficiary. Globe Re is a limited-life special purpose vehicle which provides for reinsurance coverage for U.S. catastrophic risk, such as wind (hurricanes) or earthquakes. The portfolio has a 50% concentration of risks in Florida. Juniperus invests its equity in a limited liability company that invests 77% of its assets in collateralized reinsurance transactions through collateralized swaps with a reinsurance company, and the remaining assets in instruments such as catastrophe bonds, industry loss warrants and insurer or reinsurer sidecar debt and equity arrangements. If a disaster such as U.S. wind damage, which accounts for approximately 80% of the coverage occurs, we could lose our equity investment in Globe Re of approximately $20 million. In addition, if the counterparty bank which we have a total return swap with defaults, we could also lose our equity investment. For Juniperus, if a disaster such as wind, earthquakes or other named catastrophe occurs, we could lose some or all of our equity investment of approximately $55 million.  

 As part of the Benfield merger, Aon acquired Benfield's $5 million equity stakes in certain Florida-domiciled homeowner insurance companies. Benfield's subsidiaries maintain ongoing agreements to provide modeling, actuarial, and consulting services to these insurance companies. These firms' financial results could be adversely affected if assumptions used in establishing their underwriting reserves differ from actual experience. Reserve estimates represent informed judgments based on currently available data, as well as estimates of future trends in claims severity, frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors. Many of these factors are not quantifiable in advance and both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial and legal developments and legislative changes, can cause estimates to vary. Additionally, a natural disaster occurring in Florida could increase the incidence or severity of E&O claims relating to these existing service agreements.   

In connection with the implementation of our corporate strategy, we face certain risks associated with the acquisition or disposition of businesses.   

 In pursuing our corporate strategy, we may acquire other businesses, or dispose of or exit businesses we currently own. The success of this strategy is dependent upon our ability to identify appropriate acquisition and disposition targets, negotiate transactions on favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions. If acquisitions are made, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including revenue growth, operational efficiencies or expected synergies. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could incur or assume unknown or unanticipated liabilities or contingencies, which  

16 

may impact our results of operations. If we dispose of or otherwise exit certain businesses, there can be no assurance that we will not incur certain disposition related charges, or that we will be able to reduce overhead related to the divested assets.   

Significant adjustments may occur to previously recognized tax assets and liabilities.   

 We operate in many foreign jurisdictions where tax laws relating to our businesses are not well developed. In such jurisdictions, we obtain professional guidance and consider existing industry practices before using tax planning strategies and meeting our tax obligations. Tax returns are routinely subject to audit in most jurisdictions, and tax liabilities are frequently finalized through negotiations. While historically we have not experienced significant adjustments to previously recognized tax assets and liabilities as a result of finalizing tax returns, there can be no assurance that significant adjustments will not arise.   

The anticipated benefits from the merger with Benfield may not be realized.   

 The success of the merger with Benfield will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from combining the businesses of Aon and Benfield including, among other things, synergies, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Although we expect to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger, no assurance can be given that we will successfully combine the businesses of Aon and Benfield and that these anticipated benefits will actually be achieved because achieving such benefits is subject to a number of uncertainties. Additionally, the elimination of duplicative costs may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated, and the benefits from the merger may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating Benfield with Aon. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. If we fail to realize all or some of the benefits we anticipate from the acquisition or if we fail to realize those benefits in the anticipated time period, our results of operations may be adversely affected.   

The integration of Benfield may not be successful.   

 We may be unable to effectively integrate Benfield with our operations, which would result in fewer benefits from the merger than are currently anticipated, as well as increased costs. The merger involves numerous integration and other risks, including:    

potential difficulties in the assimilation of operations, services, products and personnel;   

potential loss of customers, vendors and other business partners;   

the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns;   

the potential loss of key employees;   

the consolidation of functional areas, such as sales and marketing operations;   

possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between us and Benfield;   

the integration of information, purchasing, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll and regulatory compliance systems;   

the coordination of organizations headquartered in different geographic regions; and   

potentially significant transaction, integration and restructuring costs.   

 If the integration is not successful, we may not be able to achieve expected results and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. We cannot give any assurance that Benfield will be successfully or cost-effectively integrated into our operations.
