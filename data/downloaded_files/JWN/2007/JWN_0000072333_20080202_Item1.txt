PART I  

Item 1. Business.  

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 Nordstrom incorporated in the state of Washington in 1946 as the successor to a retail shoe business that started in 1901. We are one of the nations leading fashion specialty retailers, with 157 U.S. stores located in 28 states. The west coast and east coast are the areas in which we have the largest presence. Nordstrom is comprised of four segments: Retail Stores, Direct, Credit, and Other.  

Retail Stores derives its revenues from sales of designer, luxury and high-quality apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories. It includes our 103 Nordstrom full-line stores, 50 discount Nordstrom Rack stores, two Jeffrey boutiques, and two clearance stores that operate under the name Last Chance. The Nordstrom Rack stores purchase merchandise directly from manufacturers and also serve as outlets for clearance merchandise from our full-line stores.  

In 2007, we opened three full-line stores (Natick, Massachusetts; Novi, Michigan; and Denver, Colorado), opened one Rack store (Tukwila, Washington), and increased our ownership in two Jeffrey boutiques (Atlanta, Georgia and New York, New York). We also sold our four U.S. Façonnable boutiques (Los Angeles, California; Costa Mesa, California; New York, New York; and Miami, Florida), and our 37 international Façonnable boutiques. To date in 2008, we have opened two full-line stores (Aventura, Florida and Honolulu, Hawaii) and closed one free-standing shoe store (Honolulu, Hawaii). We are scheduled to open six more full-line stores (Burlington, Massachusetts; Clinton Township, Michigan; Thousand Oaks, California; Indianapolis, Indiana; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; and Naples, Florida), relocate one full-line store (Tacoma, Washington) and open three Rack stores (Naperville, Illinois; Laguna Hills, California; and Danvers, Massachusetts). In 2009, we are scheduled to open five full-line stores, relocate one full-line store and open two Rack stores.  

Direct generates revenues from sales of designer, luxury and high-quality apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories by serving our customers on the internet at www.nordstrom.com and through our catalogs. Direct segments sales are primarily shipped via third-party carriers from our fulfillment center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  

Through our wholly owned federal savings bank, Nordstrom fsb, we offer a private label card, two co-branded Nordstrom VISA credit cards and a debit card for Nordstrom purchases. The credit and debit cards feature a shopping-based loyalty program designed to increase customer visits and spending in our Retail Stores and Direct segments. Our Credit segment generates income through finance charges and fees on these cards.  

Our Other segment includes our product development team, called Nordstrom Product Group, which designs and coordinates the production of private label merchandise sold in our Retail Stores and Direct. In addition, this segment includes our corporate center operations. Until the sale of Façonnable in the third quarter of 2007, the Other segment also included our four U.S. Façonnable boutiques and the 37 Façonnable boutiques located in France, Portugal and Belgium. Façonnable is a wholesaler and retailer of high quality mens, womens and boys apparel and accessories with distribution to over 45 countries. Façonnable has licensee and franchisee agreements with others who operate wholesale distribution and/or boutique locations in Spain, Turkey, Greece, the Middle East, Taiwan, Canada and Latin America. We sold the Façonnable business in the third quarter of 2007. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further discussion.  

For more information about our business and our reportable segments, see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 15 and Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

TRADEMARKS

 We have approximately 144 registered trademarks or trademark applications. Our most notable trademarks include Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, John W. Nordstrom, Caslon, and Classiques Entier. Each of our trademarks is renewable indefinitely provided that it is still used in commerce at the time of the renewal.  

RETURN POLICY

 We offer our customers a fair and liberal return policy at our full-line stores and Nordstrom Direct (online and catalog). Our Nordstrom Rack stores accept returns up to 30 days from the date of purchase. In general, our return policy is somewhat more generous than industry standards. We utilize historical return patterns to estimate our expected returns.  

SEASONALITY

 Due to our anniversary sale in July and the holidays in December, sales are higher for our Retail Stores and Direct in the second and fourth quarters of the fiscal year than in the first and third quarters.  

INVENTORY

 We plan our merchandise purchases and receipts to coincide with the selling patterns that we expect. For instance, we purchase and receive a larger amount of merchandise in the fall as we prepare for the holiday shopping season (from late November through early January). Also, our merchandise purchases and receipts increase prior to our Anniversary Sale, which extends over the last two weeks of July. We pay for our merchandise purchases under the terms established with our vendors, which is usually within 30 days of the date that the merchandise was shipped to us.  

4   
In order to offer merchandise that our customers want, we purchase merchandise from a wide variety of high-quality suppliers. We also have arrangements with agents and contract manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise. Our suppliers include domestic and foreign businesses. We expect our suppliers to meet our Nordstrom Partnership: Standards and Business Practice Guidelines, which address our standards for matters such as law, labor, health and safety, and environment.  

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

 Our business is highly competitive. Each of our stores competes with other national, regional and local retail establishments that may carry similar lines of merchandise, including department stores, specialty stores, boutiques, mail order and Internet businesses. Our specific competitors vary from market to market. We believe the principal methods of competing in our industry include customer service, fashion, quality of product, depth of selection, store environment and location.  

EMPLOYEES

 During 2007, we regularly employed on a full or part-time basis approximately 55,000 employees. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, employment increased to approximately 58,500 employees in July 2007 and 56,500 in December 2007.
