ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY

We are one of the world's largest food companies with leading brands such as Tyson®, Jimmy Dean®, Hillshire Farm®, Sara Lee®, Ball Park®, Wright®, Aidells® and State Fair®. We are a recognized market leader in chicken, beef and pork as well as prepared foods, including bacon, breakfast sausage, turkey, lunchmeat, hot dogs, pizza crusts and toppings, tortillas and desserts. Some of the key factors influencing our business are customer demand for our products; the ability to maintain and grow relationships with customers and introduce new and innovative products to the marketplace; accessibility of international markets; market prices for our products; the cost and availability of live cattle and hogs, raw materials, and feed ingredients; and operating efficiencies of our facilities. 

We operate in four reportable segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Following the sale of our Mexico and Brazil operations in fiscal 2015, we began reporting our international operation, which was previously reported as the International segment, in Other. Other now includes our foreign chicken production operations in China and India and third-party merger and integration costs. All periods presented have been reclassified to reflect this change. Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods results were not impacted by this change.

On August 28, 2014, we acquired and consolidated The Hillshire Brands Company ("Hillshire Brands"), a manufacturer and marketer of branded, convenient foods. Hillshire Brands results from operations subsequent to the acquisition closing are included in the Prepared Foods segment.

OVERVIEW

•Fiscal year – Our accounting cycle resulted in a 53-week year for fiscal 2015 and a 52-week year for 2014 and 2013.

•General – Operating income grew 52% in fiscal 2015 over fiscal 2014, which was led by record earnings in our Chicken and Prepared Foods segments. Sales increased 10% to a record $41.4 billion, driven by price and mix improvements, the incremental impact of Hillshire Brands and the positive impact of 53 weeks in fiscal 2015. We continued to execute our strategy of accelerating growth in domestic value-added chicken sales, prepared food sales, innovating products, services and customer insights and cultivating our talent development to support Tyson's growth for the future.

•Hillshire Integration – We continue to maintain focus on the integration of Hillshire Brands and synergy capture. As we execute our Prepared Foods strategy, we estimate the impact of the Hillshire Brands synergies, along with the profit improvement plan related to our legacy Prepared Foods business, will have a positive impact of more than $500 million in fiscal 2016 and more than $700 million by fiscal 2017. The majority of these benefits are expected to be realized in the Prepared Foods segment. We will invest a portion of the synergies in innovation, new product launches and strengthening our brands. In fiscal 2015, we captured $322 million of synergies and profit improvement initiatives, of which $285 million impacted the Prepared Foods segment. 

•Market environment – Our Chicken segment delivered record results in fiscal 2015 driven by strong demand and favorable domestic market conditions, partially offset by disruptions caused by export bans. The Pork segment results remained in its normalized operating margin range, but were down from last year due to unfavorable market conditions from a decline in exports and periods of increased domestic availability of pork products. Our Prepared Foods segment delivered record operating income and operating margins as we continued to execute our profit improvement plan and integrate Hillshire Brands. The Beef segment experienced a loss driven by lower availability of fed cattle supplies, higher fed cattle costs, export market disruptions, and reduced demand for premium beef products due to the relative value of competing proteins.

•Mexico – We recorded a $161 million pre-tax gain as a result of the sale of our Mexico operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The gain is reflected in Other for segment reporting and included in Cost of Sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

•China impairment – Following the sale of our Mexico and Brazil chicken production operations, we have continued to review our strategies and outlook for the remaining international businesses, which operations include our chicken production operations in China. Despite our belief in the potential for this business, our Chinese operations have not achieved profitability. Given the ongoing losses being generated in this business, recent changes in the strategy and management of the business, and the depressed economic outlook for China, we assessed our Chinese operations for potential impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As a result of this evaluation, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a $169 million impairment charge. The impairment was comprised of $126 million of property, plant and equipment, $23 million of goodwill and $20 million of other assets. The China operation is included in Other for segment reporting and the impairment is included in Cost of Sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

SUMMARY OF RESULTS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015 vs. 2014 –

•Sales Volume – Sales were positively impacted by higher sales volume, which accounted for an increase of $2.4 billion. The Chicken segment had an increase in sales volume primarily due to an extra week in fiscal 2015, and the Prepared Foods segment had an increase in sales volume primarily due to the acquisition and consolidation of Hillshire Brands in our final month of fiscal 2014 in addition to an extra week in fiscal 2015. The increase in sales volume was partially offset by a decrease in the Beef and Pork segments along with the divestitures of the Mexico and Brazil chicken operations in fiscal 2015.

•Average Sales Price – Sales were positively impacted by higher average sales prices, which accounted for an increase of $1.4 billion. The Beef and Prepared Foods segments each had an increase in average sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in average sales prices in the Chicken and Pork segments. The increase in average sales price was largely due to continued tight domestic availability of beef products along with the change in mix in the Prepared Foods segment as a result of the acquisition and consolidation of Hillshire Brands in our final month of fiscal 2014.

2014 vs. 2013 –

•Sales Volume – Sales were positively impacted by an increase in sales volume, which accounted for an increase of $679 million. All segments, with the exception of the Beef segment, had an increase in sales volume. Prepared Foods contributed to the majority of the increase due to the acquisition and consolidation of Hillshire Brands in our final month of fiscal 2014.

•Average Sales Price – Sales were positively impacted by higher average sales price, which accounted for an increase of approximately $2.5 billion. Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods experienced increased average sales price, partially offset by decreased pricing in Chicken. The increase in average sales price was largely due to continued tight domestic availability of protein, increased pricing associated with rising live and raw material costs, and improved mix. The majority of the increase was driven by the Beef and Pork segments. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015 vs. 2014 –

•Cost of sales increased by approximately $2.6 billion. Higher input costs per pound increased cost of sales approximately $330 million and higher sales volume increased cost of sales approximately $2.3 billion. 

•The approximate $330 million impact of higher input costs was primarily driven by:

•Increase in live cattle cost of approximately $1.1 billion and operating costs of approximately $90 million in our Beef segment.

•Increase in input cost per pound related to the acquisition of Hillshire Brands on August 28, 2014.

•Increase of $49 million and $12 million related to Prepared Foods network optimization impairment charges and Denison plant impairment and closure costs, respectively. 

•Decrease in live hog costs of approximately $500 million in our Pork segment.

•Decrease in raw material and other input costs of approximately $290 million in our Prepared Foods segment. 

•Decreases in feed costs of approximately $450 million in our Chicken segment.

•Decrease due to net unrealized gains of $55 million in fiscal 2015, compared to net unrealized losses of $39 million in fiscal 2014, from our Beef and Pork segment commodity risk management activities. 

•The $2.3 billion impact of higher sales volume was driven by an increase in sales volume in our Chicken and Prepared Foods segments, partially offset by decreases in sales volume in our Beef and Pork segments. Prepared Foods contributed a majority of the increase due to the acquisition of Hillshire Brands on August 28, 2014, in addition to the extra week in fiscal 2015.

25

2014 vs. 2013 –

•Cost of sales increased by approximately $2.9 billion. Higher input costs per pound increased cost of sales $2.3 billion and higher sales volume increased cost of sales $610 million. 

•The $2.3 billion impact of higher input costs was primarily driven by:

•Increase in live cattle and live hog costs of approximately $1.7 billion and $550 million, respectively.

•Increase in raw material and other input costs in our Prepared Foods segment of approximately $210 million. 

•Increase due to net losses of $260 million in fiscal 2014, compared to net gains of approximately $5 million in fiscal 2013, from our Beef and Pork segment commodity risk management activities. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical purchase transactions, which mostly offset the losses. 

•Decrease in feed costs of $600 million in our Chicken segment.

•The $610 million impact of higher sales volume was driven by increases in all of our segments, with the exception of Beef. Chicken and Prepared Foods contributed to the majority of the increase, with the Prepared Foods increase mainly attributable to the acquisition and consolidation of Hillshire Brands in our final month of fiscal 2014.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015 vs. 2014 –

•Increase of $493 million in selling, general and administrative was primarily driven by:

•Increase of $487 million related to the inclusion of Hillshire Brands in fiscal 2015 results with only one month in fiscal 2014 results.

•Increase of $69 million related to incremental amortization associated with the acquired Hillshire Brands' intangibles.

•Increase of $27 million related to employee costs including payroll and stock-based compensation.

•Decrease of $59 million related to advertising and sales promotions in the legacy Tyson business primarily attributable to discontinuing certain programs that were present in fiscal 2014.

•Decrease of $14 million related to merger and integration costs and employee severance and retention costs associated with the Hillshire Brands acquisition and implementation of our Prepared Foods strategy.

•Decrease of $17 million in all other primarily related to professional fees.

2014 vs. 2013 –

•Increase of $272 million in selling, general and administrative was primarily driven by:

•Increase of $71 million related to employee costs including payroll and stock-based and incentive-based compensation, of which $19 million related to employee severance and retention costs associated with the Hillshire Brands acquisition and implementation of our Prepared Foods strategy. 

•Increase of $32 million related to advertising and sales promotions. 

•Increase of $82 million related to professional fees, of which $52 million related to the Hillshire Brands acquisition and integration costs.

•Increases of $17 million in information technology costs, $7 million in charitable contributions and donations and $5 million in commissions. 

•Increase of $50 million related to the Hillshire Brands selling, general and administrative post-closing expenses in our final month of fiscal 2014. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015/2014/2013 – Interest income remained relatively flat due to continued low interest rates.

26

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015/2014/2013 –

•Cash interest expense primarily included interest expense related to the coupon rates for senior notes and term loans and commitment/letter of credit fees incurred on our revolving credit facilities. The increase in cash interest expense in fiscal 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to senior notes and term loans issued and debt assumed in connection with our completed acquisition of Hillshire Brands on August 28, 2014.

•Non-cash interest expense primarily included amounts related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts/premiums on note issuances, offset by interest capitalized. The decrease in non-cash interest expense in fiscal 2015 and 2014 is primarily due the reduction in non-cash interest expense on our 2013 Notes which were retired in early fiscal 2014. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015 – Included $12 million of equity earnings in joint ventures and $21 million of gains on the sale of equity securities.

2014 – Included $60 million of costs associated with bridge financing facilities for the Hillshire Brands acquisition and $6 million of other than temporary impairment related to an available-for-sale security, partially offset with $14 million of equity earnings in joint ventures and net foreign currency exchange gains.

2013 – Included $19 million related to recognized currency translation adjustment gain.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SEGMENT RESULTS

We operate in four reportable segments: Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods. Following the sale of our Mexico and Brazil operations in fiscal 2015, we began reporting our international operation in Other, which was previously reported as the International segment. Other now includes our foreign chicken production operations in China and India, in addition to third-party merger and integration costs. Chicken, Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods results were not impacted by this change. All periods presented have been reclassified to reflect this change. Additionally, the results from Dynamic Fuels, which was sold in fiscal 2014, are also included in Other in comparative periods. The following table is a summary of sales and operating income (loss), which is how we measure segment income (loss). 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015 vs. 2014 –

•Sales Volume – Sales volume grew as a result of the additional week in fiscal 2015 as well as stronger demand for chicken products and mix of rendered product sales.

•Average Sales Price – Average sales price decreased as feed ingredient costs declined, partially offset by mix changes. 

•Operating Income – Operating income increased due to higher sales volume and lower feed ingredient costs of $450 million, partially offset by disruptions caused by export bans. 

2014 vs. 2013 –

•Sales Volume – Sales volume grew as a result of stronger demand for chicken products and mix of rendered product sales.

•Average Sales Price – Average sales price decreased as feed ingredient costs declined, partially offset by mix changes.

•Operating Income – Operating income increased due to higher sales volume and lower feed ingredient costs of $600 million, partially offset by decreased average sales price. 

28

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015 vs. 2014 –

•Sales Volume – Sales volume decreased due to reduced live cattle supplies available to process, partially offset by an additional week in fiscal 2015. 

•Average Sales Price – Average sales price increased due to lower domestic availability of beef products.

•Operating Income – Operating income decreased due to unfavorable market conditions associated with a decrease in supply which drove up fed cattle costs, export market disruptions, the relative value of competing proteins and increased operating costs. Additionally, in fiscal 2015, we incurred $12 million in Denison plant impairment and closure costs and $81 million of losses from mark-to-market open derivative positions and lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments, which was mostly the result of a large and rapid decline in live cattle futures in September of fiscal 2015.

2014 vs. 2013 –

•Sales Volume – Sales volume decreased due to a reduction in live cattle processed.

•Average Sales Price – Average sales price increased due to lower domestic availability of beef products.

•Operating Income – Operating income increased due to improved operational execution and maximizing our revenues relative to the rising live cattle markets, partially offset by increased operating costs.

•Derivative Activities – Operating results included net losses of $72 million in fiscal 2014, compared to net gains of $9 million in fiscal 2013 for commodity risk management activities related to futures contracts. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which mostly offset the commodity risk management gains and losses. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015 vs. 2014 –

•Sales Volume – Sales volume decreased due to the divestiture of our Heinold Hog Markets business in the first quarter of fiscal 2015. Excluding the impact of the divestiture, we had a 5.4% increase in sales volume as a result of the additional week in fiscal 2015 as well as better demand for our pork products. 

•Average Sales Price – Average sales price decreased due to an increase in live hog supplies, which drove down livestock cost and average sales price.

•Operating Income – While reduced compared to prior year, operating income remained strong as we maximized our revenues relative to live hog markets, partially attributable to operational and mix performance.

2014 vs. 2013 –

•Sales Volume – Sales volume increased due to better domestic demand for our pork products.

•Average Sales Price – Average sales price increased due to lower total hog supplies, which resulted in higher input costs.

•Operating Income – Operating income increased as we maximized our revenues relative to live hog markets, partially attributable to operational and mix performance.

•Derivative Activities – Operating results included net losses of $112 million in fiscal 2014, compared to net losses of $15 million in fiscal 2013 for commodity risk management activities related to futures contracts. These amounts exclude the impact from related physical sale and purchase transactions, which mostly offset the commodity risk management losses. 

29

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015 vs. 2014 –

•Sales Volume – Sales volume increased due to incremental volumes from the acquisition of Hillshire Brands and an additional week in fiscal 2015.

•Average Sales Price – Average sales price increased primarily due to better product mix which was positively impacted by the acquisition of Hillshire Brands.

•Operating Income – Operating income improved due to an increase in sales volume and average sales price mainly attributed to Hillshire Brands, as well as lower raw material costs of approximately $290 million for fiscal 2015 related to our legacy Prepared Foods business. Profit improvement initiatives and Hillshire Brands synergies positively impacted Prepared Foods operating income by $285 million for fiscal 2015. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we incurred $59 million in impairment charges associated with optimizing our Prepared Foods network. 

2014 vs. 2013 – 

•Sales Volume – Sales volume increased as a result of improved demand for our Prepared Foods products and incremental volumes as a result of the acquisition of Hillshire Brands in our final month of fiscal 2014. 

•Average Sales Price – Average sales price increased due to price increases associated with higher input costs along with better product mix which was positively impacted incrementally by the acquisition of Hillshire Brands in our final month of fiscal 2014.

•Operating Income – Operating income decreased as a result of higher raw material and other input costs of approximately $210 million. Because many of our sales contracts are formula based or shorter-term in nature, we are typically able to offset rising input costs through pricing. However, there is a lag time for price increases to take effect. Additionally, operating income was reduced by $113 million due to additional costs associated with the Prepared Foods improvement plan, Hillshire Brands post-closing results, purchase price accounting adjustments and ongoing costs related to a legacy Hillshire Brands plant fire.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2015 vs. 2014 –

•Sales – Sales decreased due to the sale of the Mexico and Brazil chicken production operations in fiscal 2015.

•Operating loss – Operating loss improved $69 million from our international operations due to the sale of our Brazil operation and better market conditions in Mexico (prior to its sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015), partially offset by challenging market conditions in China. Additionally, third-party merger and integration costs decreased by $12 million and losses associated with Dynamic Fuels, which was sold in fiscal 2014, decreased $15 million.

2014 vs. 2013 – 

•Operating loss – Operating loss increased $84 million from our international operations due to poor operational execution in Brazil, charges of $42 million for an impairment of Brazil assets and other costs related to the sale of the Brazil operation, challenging market conditions in Brazil and China and additional costs incurred as we grew our international operation. Additionally, third-party merger and integration costs increased $59 million in fiscal 2014 and losses associated with Dynamic Fuels, which was sold in fiscal 2014, increased by $15 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our cash needs for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, the repurchases of senior notes, repayment of term loans and share repurchases are expected to be met with current cash on hand, cash flows provided by operating activities, or short-term borrowings. Based on our current expectations, we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business. However, we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions. The amount, nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Operating cash outflow associated with the Convertible debt discount related to the initial debt discount of $92 million on our 3.25% convertible notes issued in 2008, which matured on October 15, 2013, and were retired in fiscal 2014. 

•Impairment of assets in fiscal 2015 included $59 million of impairment charges related to our Prepared Foods network optimization and $169 million of impairments related to our China operation. For further description regarding these charges refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3: Acquisitions and Dispositions and Note 10: Other Income and Charges.

•Other, net increase in fiscal 2015 is primarily driven by non-cash pension expense.

•Cash flows associated with changes in operating assets and liabilities:

•2015 – Increased primarily due to the decrease in inventory and accounts receivable balances and an increase in taxes payable, partially offset by the decrease in accounts payable. The decreased inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable balances were largely due to decreased raw material costs and timing of sales and payments.

•2014 – Decreased primarily due to the increase in inventory and accounts receivable balances and decrease in income taxes payable, partially offset by the increase in accounts payable. The higher inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable balances are primarily attributable to significant increases in input costs and price increases associated with the increased input costs.

•2013 – Decreased primarily due to a higher accounts receivable balance, partially offset by increases in accrued salaries, wages and benefits and income tax payable. The higher accounts receivable balance is largely due to significant increases in input costs and price increases associated with the increased input costs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Additions to property, plant and equipment included acquiring new equipment and upgrading our facilities to maintain competitive standing and position us for future opportunities. 

31

•Capital spending for fiscal 2016 is expected to approximate $900 million and will include spending on our operations for production and labor efficiencies, yield improvements and sales channel flexibility.

•Purchases of marketable securities included funding for our deferred compensation plans.

•Proceeds from sale of businesses primarily included proceeds, net of cash transferred, from the sale of the Mexico and Brazil operations.

•Acquisitions in fiscal 2014 related to acquiring Hillshire Brands and an additional value-added food business as part of our strategy to accelerate growth in our prepared foods sales. Both of these acquisitions are included in the Prepared Foods segment. For further description regarding these transactions refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3: Acquisitions and Dispositions.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Payments on debt included –

•2015 –$353 million related to the 5-year tranche A term loan facility and $1,172 million related to the 3-year tranche A term loan facility.

•2014 – Our 3.25% convertible notes issued in 2008 matured on October 15, 2013, at which time we paid the $458 million principal value with cash on hand and settled the conversion premium by issuing 11.7 million shares of our Class A stock from available treasury shares. These notes were initially recorded at a $92 million discount, which equaled the fair value of an equity conversion premium instrument. The portion of the payment of these notes related to the initial $92 million discount was recorded in cash flows from operating activities. Simultaneous to the settlement of the conversion premium, we received 11.7 million shares of our Class A stock from the call options purchased at the time of issuance of the notes.

•2014 – $194 million related to the 5-year tranche A term loan facility and $30 million related to the 3-year tranche A term loan facility.

•Proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and borrowings/payments on revolving credit facility –

•2015 –$500 million from term loans, the full balance of which was used to prepay outstanding borrowings under the 3-year tranche A term loan facility. In addition, we had borrowings and payments on our revolver of $1,345 million for fiscal 2015. We utilized our revolving credit facility to balance our cash position with term loan deleveraging and changes in working capital. Additionally, total debt of our foreign subsidiaries was $10 million at October 3, 2015, all of which is classified as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

•2014 – $2,300 million from term loans and $3,243 million from senior unsecured notes after original issue discounts of $7 million. Additionally, total debt related to our foreign subsidiaries was $8 million at September 27, 2014, all of which is classified as long-term in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

•2013 – $68 million primarily from our foreign subsidiaries. Total debt of our foreign subsidiaries was $60 million at September 28, 2013 ($40 million current, $20 million long-term).

32

•Proceeds from issuance of debt and equity components of tangible equity units – 

•2014 – We issued 30 million, 4.75% tangible equity units (TEUs). Total proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and other expenses, were $1,454 million. Each TEU is comprised of a prepaid stock purchase contract and a senior amortizing note due July 15, 2017. We allocated the proceeds from the issuance of the TEUs to equity and debt based on the relative fair values of the respective components of each TEU. The fair value of the prepaid stock purchase contracts, which was $1,295 million, is recorded in Capital in Excess of Par Value, net of $40 million issuance costs. The fair value of the senior amortizing notes, which was $205 million, was recorded in debt, of which $65 million was current.

•Proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs – 

•2014 – We issued 23.8 million shares of our Class A common stock, for total proceeds, net of underwriting discounts and other offering related fees and expenses, of $873 million. 

•Purchases of Tyson Class A common stock include –

•$455 million, $250 million and $550 million for shares repurchased pursuant to our share repurchase program in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

•$40 million, $45 million and $64 million for shares repurchased to fund certain obligations under our equity compensation plans in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

•We expect to continue repurchasing shares under our share repurchase program. As of October 3, 2015, 21.1 million shares remain authorized for repurchases. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares will depend upon, among other things, our working capital needs, market conditions, liquidity targets, our debt obligations and regulatory requirements.

•Subsequent to October 3, 2015, we have repurchased $257 million, or approximately 5.7 million shares, of our common stock under our share repurchase program. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The revolving credit facility supports our short-term funding needs and letters of credit. The letters of credit issued under this facility are primarily in support of leasing obligations and workers’ compensation insurance programs. Our maximum borrowing under the revolving credit facility during fiscal 2015 was $450 million. 

•At October 3, 2015, we had current debt of $715 million, which we intend to repay with cash generated from our operating activities and other liquidity sources. 

•We expect net interest expense will approximate $255 million for fiscal 2016.

•At October 3, 2015, approximately $270 million of our cash was held in the international accounts of our foreign subsidiaries. Generally, we do not rely on the foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs. Rather, we manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The repatriation of cash balances from certain of our foreign subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences or be subject to regulatory capital requirements; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations. United States income taxes, net of applicable foreign tax credits, have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Our intention is to reinvest the cash held by foreign subsidiaries permanently or to repatriate the cash only when it is tax efficient to do so.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Capital Resources

Credit Facility

Cash flows from operating activities and current cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. We also have a revolving credit facility, with a committed capacity of $1.25 billion, to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs, letters of credit and a source of financing for growth opportunities. As of October 3, 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $6 million issued under this facility, none of which were drawn upon, which left $1,244 million available for borrowing. Our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 42 banks, with commitments ranging from $0.3 million to $85 million per bank. The syndicate includes bank holding companies that are required to be adequately capitalized under federal bank regulatory agency requirements.

Capitalization

To monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. We monitor the ratio of our net debt to EBITDA as support for our long-term financing decisions. At October 3, 2015, and September 27, 2014, the ratio of our net debt to EBITDA was 2.1x and 4.1x, respectively. Refer to Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data, for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures. The decrease in this ratio for fiscal 2015 is due to increased EBITDA and the approximate $1.7 billion net debt reduction during fiscal 2015.

Credit Ratings

2016 Notes

On February 11, 2013, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P), upgraded the credit rating of the 2016 Notes from "BBB-" to "BBB." This upgrade did not impact the interest rate on the 2016 Notes. 

On June 7, 2012, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's) upgraded the credit rating of the 2016 Notes from "Ba1" to "Baa3." This upgrade decreased the interest rate on the 2016 Notes from 6.85% to 6.60%, effective beginning with the six-month interest payment due October 1, 2012. 

A one-notch downgrade by Moody's would increase the interest rates on the 2016 Notes by 0.25%. A two-notch downgrade from S&P would increase the interest rates on the 2016 Notes by 0.25%.

Revolving Credit Facility

S&P’s corporate credit rating for Tyson Foods, Inc. is "BBB." Moody’s senior, unsecured, subsidiary guaranteed long-term debt rating for Tyson Foods, Inc. is "Baa3." Fitch Ratings' (Fitch), issuer default rating for Tyson Foods, Inc. is "BBB." The below table outlines the fees paid on the unused portion of the facility (Facility Fee Rate) and letter of credit fees (Undrawn Letter of Credit Fee and Borrowing Spread) depending on the rating levels of Tyson Foods, Inc. from S&P, Moody's and Fitch.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the event the rating levels are split, the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level in effect for two of the rating agencies, or, if all three rating agencies have different rating levels, the applicable fees and spread will be based upon the rating level that is between the rating levels of the other two rating agencies.

Debt Covenants

Our revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In addition, we are required to maintain minimum interest expense coverage and maximum debt-to-capitalization ratios. 

Our senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. 

We were in compliance with all debt covenants at October 3, 2015.

34

Pension Plans 

As further described in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits, the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets. The funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of $410 million at the end of fiscal 2015 as compared to an underfunded position of $381 million at the end of fiscal 2014. 

We expect to contribute approximately $63 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2016 as compared to approximately $14 million in fiscal 2015 and $9 million in fiscal 2014. The exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements. As a result, the actual funding in fiscal 2016 may be different from the estimate. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. The off-balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of debt of outside third parties, including leases and grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion.

35

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of October 3, 2015:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) In the event of a default on payment, acceleration of the principal payments could occur.

(2) Interest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. Payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective interest rates at October 3, 2015, and expected payment dates.

(3) Amounts include guarantees of debt of outside third parties, which consist of leases and grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments.

(4) Amounts include minimum lease payments under lease agreements.

(5) Amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains, livestock contracts and fixed grower fees, that provide terms that meet the above criteria. For certain grain purchase commitments with a fixed quantity provision, we have assumed the future obligations under the commitment based on available commodity futures prices as published in observable active markets as of October 3, 2015. We have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders are not included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and is cancelable. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded.

(6) Amounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of October 3, 2015.

(7) Other long-term liabilities primarily consist of deferred compensation, deferred income, self-insurance, and asset retirement obligations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of these payments beyond fiscal 2016; therefore, we have only included the total liability in the table above. We also have employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits of $495 million that are excluded from the table above. A discussion of the Company's pension and postretirement plans, including funding matters, is included in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.

In addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $284 million and related interest and penalties of $46 million at October 3, 2015, recorded as liabilities.

The maximum contractual obligation associated with our cash flow assistance programs at October 3, 2015, based on the estimated fair values of the livestock supplier’s net tangible assets on that date, aggregated to approximately $310 million. There were no receivables under these programs at October 3, 2015.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties 

Effect if Actual Results Differ From

Assumptions

Contingent liabilities    

We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.

A determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required, if any, for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. We accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable. Our contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events, and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances, differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages, and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control. 

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.

Marketing and advertising costs    

We incur advertising, retailer incentive and consumer incentive costs to promote products through marketing programs. These programs include cooperative advertising, volume discounts, in-store display incentives, coupons and other programs.

Marketing and advertising costs are charged in the period incurred. We accrue costs based on the estimated performance, historical utilization and redemption of each program.

Cash consideration given to customers is considered a reduction in the price of our products, thus recorded as a reduction to sales. The remainder of marketing and advertising costs is recorded as a selling, general and administrative expense. 

Recognition of the costs related to these programs contains uncertainties due to judgment required in estimating the potential performance and redemption of each program.

These estimates are based on many factors, including experience of similar promotional programs. 

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our marketing accruals during the past three fiscal years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our marketing accruals. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.

A 10% change in our marketing accruals at October 3, 2015, would impact pretax earnings by approximately $19 million.

Assumptions

Accrued self-insurance    

We are self-insured for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability claims.

We use an independent third-party actuary to assist in determining our self-insurance liability. We and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our self-insurance liability, including claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.

We periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third-party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our self-insurance liability. Our policy is to maintain an accrual within the central to high point of the actuarial range. 

Our self-insurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgment used.

Costs to settle our obligations, including legal and healthcare costs, could increase or decrease causing estimates of our self-insurance liability to change.

Incident rates, including frequency and severity, could increase or decrease causing estimates in our self-insurance liability to change. 

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our self-insurance liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.

A 10% increase in the actuarial estimate at October 3, 2015, would result in an increase in the amount we recorded for our self-insurance liability of approximately $27 million. A 10% decrease in the actuarial estimate at October 3, 2015, would result in a decrease in the amount we recorded for our self-insurance liability of approximately $3 million.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties 

Effect if Actual Results Differ From

Assumptions

Defined benefit pension plans    

We sponsor nine defined benefit pension plans that provide retirement benefits to certain employees. We also participate in a multi-employer plan that provides defined benefits to certain employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Such plans are usually administered by a board of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives.

We use independent third-party actuaries to assist us in determining our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. We and the actuaries review assumptions that include estimates of the present value of the projected future pension payment to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. We accumulate and amortize the effect of actuarial gains and losses over future periods.

Net periodic benefit costs for the defined benefit pension plans were $16 million in fiscal 2015. The projected benefit obligation was $1,986 million at the end of fiscal 2015. Unrecognized actuarial losses were $100 million at the end of fiscal 2015. We currently expect net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2016 to be approximately $35 million.

Plan assets are currently comprised of approximately 85% fixed income securities and 11% equity securities. Fixed income securities can include, but are not limited to, direct bond investments and pooled or indirect bond investments. Other investments may include, but are not limited to, international and domestic equities, real estate, commodities and private equity.

We expect to contribute approximately $63 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2016. The exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements.

Our defined benefit pension plans contain uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgments used. 

The key assumptions used in developing the required estimates include such factors as discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement rates, and mortality. 

These assumptions can have a material impact upon the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost. 

The discount rates were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate. In determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we first examined historical rates of return for the various asset classes within the plans. We then determined a long-term projected rate-of-return based on expected returns. Investment, management and other fees paid out of plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. 

It is reasonably likely that changes in external factors will result in changes to the assumptions used to measure pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost in future periods. 

The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans. The net pension cost of the multiemployer plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our employees. The future cost of these plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations.  

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost during the past three fiscal years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, they are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect the net periodic benefit cost in future periods.

A 1% increase in the discount rate at October 3, 2015, would result in a decrease in the projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost of approximately $240 million and $5 million, respectively. A 1% decrease in the discount rate at October 3, 2015, would result in an increase in the projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost of approximately $298 million and $11 million, respectively. 

A 1% change in the return on plan assets at October 3, 2015, would impact the net periodic benefit cost by approximately $16 million.

The sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time with the remaining assumptions held constant. Economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and that the effect of changes in assumptions are not necessarily linear.

Description Judgments and Uncertainties 

Effect if Actual Results Differ From

Assumptions

Income taxes    

We estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income.

Federal income tax includes an estimate for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be taxable upon remittance to the United States, except for earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary.

Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.

Valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset.

We record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.

Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.

Changes in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future.

Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate.

Our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances. However, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities.

To the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution.

Impairment of long-lived assets and definite life intangibles  

Long-lived assets and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset, a change in its physical condition, or an unexpected change in financial performance.

When evaluating long-lived assets and definite life intangibles for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset. For assets held for sale, we compare the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value. The impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.

We recorded impairment charges related to long-lived assets and definite life intangibles of $262 million, $107 million and $74 million, in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions, including useful lives of assets, forecasted sales, operating margins, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 

that reflects the risk inherent

in future cash flows to determine fair

value. 

We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles during the last three fiscal years.

We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material. 

We are conducting a project designed to optimize our network capacity and to enhance manufacturing efficiencies in the future. Additionally, we continue to evaluate our international operations and strategies. If we have a significant change in strategies, outlook, or a manner in which we plan to use these assets, we may be exposed to future impairments.

Impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets

Description: Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. If it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may be more likely than not less than carrying amount or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. We can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test. 

The quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed using a two-step process. The first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the quantitative impairment test is not necessary. However, if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any.

The second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying amount, then goodwill is not considered impaired. However, if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination (i.e., the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all the assets and liabilities, including any unrecognized intangible assets, as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was determined as the exit price a market participant would pay for the same business).

For indefinite life intangible assets, a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired. Similar to goodwill, we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test. Upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We elected to forgo the qualitative assessments on our indefinite life intangible assets for the fiscal 2015 impairment test.

We have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets prior to the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business or a sustained decline in market capitalization.

Judgments and Uncertainties: We estimate the fair value of our reporting units, using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.

We include assumptions about sales, operating margins and growth rates which consider our budgets, business plans and economic projections, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. Generally, we utilize normalized operating margin assumptions based on future expectations and operating margins historically realized in the reporting units' industries. For the fiscal 2015 impairment test of material reporting units, our Beef and Prepared Foods reporting units utilized operating margins in future years in excess of the operating margin realized in the most recent year. 

Our Beef reporting unit, which is our Beef operating segment, had goodwill at October 3, 2015, totaling $676 million. We generally assumed operating margins in future years would be in our normalized range of 1.5% to 3%, as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. Had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year, we would have failed the first step of the annual impairment test, which would have required the second step to be performed and may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss. The current year Beef reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction, primarily due to unusual items in fiscal 2015 including unfavorable market conditions associated with a temporary decline in supply which drove up live cattle prices, export market disruptions, and losses from mark-to-market open derivative positions and lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments due to a large and rapid decline in live cattle futures in September of fiscal 2015. To pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2015, the Beef reporting unit’s projected operating margins had to average 1.2% (breakeven). Although, the Beef reporting unit’s actual performance in fiscal 2015 was below this amount, it has performed above the 1.2% breakeven operating margin level in each of the previous six years and is expected to perform at or above this level in fiscal 2016. Valuing the Beef reporting unit utilizing projected operating margins averaging less than 1.2% (breakeven), or a 62% increase in the discount rate used in fiscal 2015, would have caused the carrying value of the Beef reporting unit to be in excess of fair value, which would have required the second step to be performed.

41

Our Prepared Foods reporting unit, which is our Prepared Foods operating segment, had goodwill at October 3, 2015, totaling $4,005 million. We generally assumed operating margins in future years would be in our expected range of 10% to 12%, as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. Had we assumed future operating margins consistent with those realized in the current fiscal year, we would have failed the first step of the annual impairment test, which would have required the second step to be performed and may have resulted in a material goodwill impairment loss. The current year Prepared Foods reporting unit results were not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction as we are still integrating Hillshire Brands into the reporting unit including capturing the full benefit of the expected synergies. As we proceed with the integration of Hillshire Brands, we realized synergies of $322 million in fiscal 2015 and expect to realize more than $500 million in fiscal 2016 and $700 million in fiscal 2017, of which the majority of these benefits will be realized in the Prepared Foods segment. To pass the first step of the annual impairment test in fiscal 2015, the Prepared Foods reporting unit’s projected operating margins had to average 7.7% (breakeven). We exceeded the breakeven operating margin level for the second half of fiscal 2015 and expect to exceed it in fiscal 2016.

The fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings valuation approaches, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy, and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data.

Our impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to uncontrollable events that could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions.

Effect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions: We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and intangible assets during the last three years. 

During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, all of our material reporting units that underwent a quantitative test passed the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis and therefore, the second step was not necessary. In fiscal 2015, we recorded a $23 million full impairment of an immaterial reporting unit’s goodwill.

Some of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates and credit ratings. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangibles, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, we may be required to perform the second step, which could result in additional material impairments of our goodwill.

All of our material reporting units' estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20% at the date of their most recent estimated fair value determination. Consequently, we do not currently consider any of our material reporting units at significant risk of failing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test.

The discount rate used in our annual goodwill impairment test decreased to 6.8% in fiscal 2015 from 7.9% in fiscal 2014. Discount rates continue to be low compared to historical levels. A 35% increase in the discount rate would have caused our Prepared Foods reporting unit, with $4,005 million of goodwill at October 3, 2015, to fail the first step of the goodwill impairment step and may have resulted in a material impairment upon completion of the second step. 

We did not have material indefinite life intangible assets prior to the acquisition of Hillshire Brands in August 2014. Our fiscal 2015 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge. A 3.5% decrease in the fair value of an indefinite life intangible with a carrying value of $301 million, and a 16.5% decrease in the fair value of an indefinite life intangible with a carrying value of $2,175 million, would have caused their carrying value to exceed fair value. All other indefinite life intangible assets’ estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value by more than 20%. 

The discount rate used in our annual indefinite life intangible assets impairment test was 8.0% in fiscal 2015. A 20% increase in the discount rate would have caused the carrying value of three intangible assets, which have a combined carrying value of $3,008 million, to exceed fair value.
