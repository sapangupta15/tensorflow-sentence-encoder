PART I 

     Item 1. Business. 

 OVERVIEW  

 Aon Corporation (which may be referred to as "Aon," "the Company," "we," "us," or "our") provides risk management and human capital consulting services, delivering distinctive client value via innovative and effective risk management solutions, including insurance and reinsurance brokerage and workforce productivity solutions. Aon's technical expertise is delivered locally through colleagues worldwide.  

 We serve clients through the following businesses:    

Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services business acts as an advisor and insurance broker, helping clients manage their risks, as well as negotiating and placing insurance risk with insurance carriers through our global distribution network.   

Consulting business provides advice and services to clients related to health and benefits, retirement, compensation, strategic human capital, and human resource outsourcing.   

 Our clients include corporations and businesses, insurance companies, professional organizations, independent agents and brokers, governments, and other entities. We also serve individuals through personal lines, affinity groups, and certain specialty operations.  

 In November 2008, we expanded our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services product offerings through the merger with Benfield Group Limited ("Benfield"), a leading independent reinsurance intermediary. Benfield products have been integrated with our existing reinsurance products.  

 In April 2008, we completed the sale of our Combined Insurance Company of America ("CICA") and Sterling Insurance Company ("Sterling") subsidiaries, which represented the majority of the operations of our former Insurance Underwriting segment. In August 2009, we completed the sale of our remaining property and casualty insurance underwriting operations that were in run-off. The results of all of these operations are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented.  

 Aon was incorporated in 1979 under the laws of Delaware, and is the parent corporation of both long-established and acquired companies. We have approximately 36,200 employees and conduct our operations through various subsidiaries in more than 120 countries and sovereignties.  

 BUSINESS SEGMENTS  

 Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services Segment  

 The Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment generated approximately 83% of our consolidated total revenues in 2009, and has approximately 28,800 employees worldwide. We provide risk and insurance brokerage and related services in this segment primarily through our Aon Risk Services and Aon Benfield companies.  

 Principal Products and Services  

 We operate in this segment through two product lines: retail brokerage and reinsurance brokerage.  

 Retail brokerage encompasses our retail brokerage services, affinity products, managing general underwriting, placement, and captive management services. The Americas' operations provide products and services to clients in North, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and Bermuda. Our United Kingdom; Europe, Middle East & Africa; and Asia Pacific operations offer similar products and services to clients throughout the rest of the world.  

2 

 Our employees draw upon our global network of resources, industry-leading data and analytics, and specialized expertise to deliver value to clients ranging from small and mid-sized businesses to multi-national corporations as well as individuals in need of personal coverage. We work with clients to identify their business needs and help them assess and understand their total cost of risk. Once we have gained an understanding of our client's risk management needs, we are able to leverage our global network and implement a customized risk approach with local Aon resources. The outcome is a comprehensive risk solution provided locally and personally. The "Client Promise" enables our colleagues around the globe to describe, benchmark and price the value we deliver to clients in a unified approach, based on the ten most important criteria that our clients believe are critical to managing their total cost of risk.  

 Knowledge and foresight, unparalleled benchmarking and carrier knowledge are the qualities at the heart of our professional services excellence. With advanced technology such as our Global Risk Insight PlatformSM, we are uniquely positioned to provide clients with insights into market conditions, premium rates and best practices in program design, across all industries and economic centers.  

 As a retail broker, we serve as an advisor to clients and facilitate a wide spectrum of risk management solutions for property liability, general liability, professional and directors' and officers' liability, workers' compensation, and additional exposures. Our business is comprised of several specialty areas structured around specific product and industry needs.  

 We deliver specialized advice and services in such industries as technology, financial services, agribusiness, aviation, construction, health care and energy, among others. Through our global Affinity business, we provide products for professional liability, life, disability income and personal lines for individuals, associations and businesses around the world.  

 In addition, we are a major provider of risk consulting services, including captive management, that provide our clients with alternative vehicles for managing risks that would be cost-prohibitive or unavailable in traditional insurance markets.  

 Finally, our eSolutions products enable clients to manage risks, policies, claims and safety concerns efficiently through an integrated technology platform.  

 Reinsurance brokerage offers sophisticated advisory services in program design and claim recoveries that enhance the risk/return characteristics of insurance policy portfolios, improve capital utilization, and evaluate and mitigate catastrophic loss exposures worldwide. An insurance or reinsurance company may seek reinsurance or other risk-transfer solutions on all or a portion of the risks it insures. To accomplish this, our reinsurance brokerage services use dynamic financial analysis and capital market alternatives, such as transferring catastrophe risk through securitization. Reinsurance brokerage also offers investment banking products and services.  

 We act as a broker or intermediary for all classes of reinsurance. We place two main types of property and casualty reinsurance: treaty reinsurance, which involves the transfer of a portfolio of risks, and facultative reinsurance, which entails the transfer of part or all of the coverage provided by a single insurance policy. We also place specialty lines such as professional liability, medical malpractice, accident, life and health.  

 We also provide actuarial, enterprise risk management, catastrophe management and rating agency advisory services. We have also developed tools and models that help our clients understand the financial implications of natural and man-made catastrophes around the world. Aon Benfield Securities provides global investment banking services for insurance and reinsurance clients. In this capacity, Aon Benfield Securities is recognized as a leader in: (i) the structuring, underwriting and trading of insurance-linked securities; (ii) the arrangement of financing for insurance and reinsurance companies, including Lloyd's syndicates; and (iii) providing advice on strategic and capital alternatives, including mergers and acquisitions.

 Compensation  

 We generate revenues through commissions, fees from clients, and compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies for services we provide to them. Commission rates and fees vary depending upon several factors, which may include the amount of premium, the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular services provided to an insurer or reinsurer, and the capacity in which we act. Payment terms are competitive with current industry practice.  

 We typically hold funds on behalf of clients as a result of premiums received from clients and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. These funds held on behalf of clients are generally invested in interest-bearing premium trust accounts and can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect cash from our clients and when premiums are remitted to the insurance carriers. We earn interest on these accounts. However, the principal is segregated and not available for general operating purposes.  

 Competition  

 The risk and insurance brokerage services business is highly competitive, and we compete primarily with two other global insurance brokers, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Willis Group Holdings Ltd., in addition to numerous specialists, regional and local firms in almost every area of our business. We also compete with insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents; and with other businesses that do not fall into the categories above, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms, and consultants that provide risk-related services and products. We are ranked as the largest retail insurance broker worldwide based on pure brokerage operations, as well as the largest worldwide reinsurance broker, and we have been recognized by the readers of Business Insurance magazine as the leading retail/agent broker with greater than $250 million in revenue for the last three consecutive years.  

 Seasonality  

 The Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment typically experiences higher revenues in the fourth and first calendar quarters of each year, primarily due to the timing of policy renewals.  

 Consulting  

 The Consulting segment generated approximately 17% of our consolidated total revenues in 2009. This segment has approximately 6,400 employees worldwide with operations in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Europe, South Africa, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific region.  

 Principal Products and Services  

 We provide products and services in this segment primarily through Aon Consulting, offering a broad range of consulting services in the following practice areas:  

 Consulting Services:  

 Health and Benefits advises clients about structuring, funding, and administering employee benefit programs, which attract, retain, and motivate employees. Benefits consulting includes health and welfare, executive benefits, workforce strategies and productivity, absence management, benefits administration, data-driven health, compliance, employee commitment, investment advisory, and elective benefits services.  

 Retirement specializes in providing global actuarial services, defined contribution consulting, investment consulting, tax and ERISA consulting, and pension administration.  

4 

 Compensation focuses on compensation advisory/counsel including: compensation planning design, executive reward strategies, salary survey and benchmarking, market share studies and sales force effectiveness, with special expertise in the financial services and technology industries.  

 Strategic Human Capital delivers advice to complex global organizations on talent, change and organizational effectiveness issues, including talent strategy and acquisition, executive on-boarding, performance management, leadership assessment and development, communication strategy, workforce training and change management.  

 Outsourcing:  

 Human Resource Outsourcing offers employment processing, performance improvement, benefits administration, and other employment-related services.  

 Aon Consulting works to maximize the value of clients' human resources spending, increase employee productivity, and improve employee performance. Our approach addresses a trend toward more diverse workforces (demographics, nationalities, cultures and work/lifestyle preferences) that require more choices and flexibility among employers  in order that they can provide benefit options suited to individual needs.  

 Our consulting professionals work with their clients to identify options in human resource outsourcing and process improvements. Prime areas where companies choose to use outsourcing services include the assessment and selection of job candidates, employment processing, training and development, benefits administration, and the individual benefits enrollment process.  

 Compensation  

 Revenues are principally derived from fees paid by clients for advice and services. In addition, insurance companies pay us commissions for placing individual and group insurance contracts, primarily life, health and accident coverages, and pay us fees for consulting and other services that we provide to them. Payment terms are competitive with current industry practice.  

 Competition  

 Our consulting business faces strong competition from other worldwide and national consulting companies, as well as regional and local firms. Competitors include independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, and financial services firms. Some of our competitors provide administrative or consulting services as an adjunct to other primary services. Based on total revenues, we believe we are among the top five largest employee benefits consultants in the world.  

 Seasonality  

 Due to buying patterns in the markets we serve, revenues tend to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter.  

 Licensing and Regulation  

 Our business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well as the laws of other countries in which we operate. See the discussion contained in the "Risk Factors" section in Part I, Item 1A of this report for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.  

5 

 Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services  

 Regulatory authorities in the states or countries in which the operating subsidiaries of our Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment conduct business may require individual or company licensing to act as producers, brokers, agents, third party administrators, managing general agents, reinsurance intermediaries, or adjusters.  

 Under the laws of most states in the U.S. and most foreign countries, regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion with respect to granting, renewing and revoking producers', brokers' and agents' licenses to transact business in the state or country. The operating terms may vary according to the licensing requirements of the particular state or country, which may require, among other things, that a firm operate in the state or country through a local corporation. In a few states and countries, licenses may be issued only to individual residents or locally owned business entities. In such cases, our subsidiaries either have such licenses or have arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in the state or country.  

 Our subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business. These laws and regulations are enforced by state agencies in the U.S., by the Financial Services Authority ("FSA") in the U.K., and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business, licensing of agents, monitoring of trade practices, policy form approval, limits on commission rates, and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements.  

 Insurance authorities in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, including the FSA in the U.K., also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them.  

 Further, certain of our business activities within the Risk and Insurance Brokerage Services segment are governed by other regulatory bodies, including investment, securities and futures licensing authorities. In the U.S., Aon Consulting, Aon Risk Services and Aon Benfield utilize Aon Benfield Securities, Inc., a U.S.-registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, member of FINRA/SIPC, and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Aon, for investment banking services and other broker-dealer activities.  

 Consulting  

 Certain of the retirement-related consulting services provided by Aon Consulting and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the pension and financial laws and regulations of applicable jurisdictions, including oversight and/or supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in the U.S., the FSA in the U.K., and regulators in other countries. In addition, other services provided by Aon Consulting and its subsidiaries and affiliates, such as trustee services, investment services (including advice to clients on the investment of personal pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities) and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services, are subject in various jurisdictions to pension, investment, and securities and/or insurance laws and regulations and/or supervision by national regulators.  

 Clientele  

 Our clients operate in many businesses and industries throughout the world. No one client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated total revenues in 2009. Additionally, we place insurance with many insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2009.

 Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements  

 This report contains certain statements related to future results, or states our intentions, beliefs and expectations or predictions for the future which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations or forecasts of future events. They use words such as "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "project," "intend," "plan," "potential," and other similar terms, and future or conditional tense verbs like "could," "may," "might," "should," "will" and "would." You can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. For example, we may use forward-looking statements when addressing topics such as: market and industry conditions, including competitive and pricing trends; changes in our business strategies and methods of generating revenue; the development and performance of our services and products; changes in the composition or level of our revenues; our cost structure and the outcome of cost-saving or restructuring initiatives; the outcome of contingencies; dividend policy; the expected impact of acquisitions and dispositions; pension obligations; cash flow and liquidity; future actions by regulators; and the impact of changes in accounting rules. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from either historical or anticipated results depending on a variety of factors. Potential factors that could impact results include:    

general economic conditions in different countries in which we do business around the world;   

changes in global equity and fixed income markets that could affect the return on invested assets;   

fluctuations in exchange and interest rates that could impact revenue and expense;   

rating agency actions that could affect our ability to borrow funds;   

changes in the funded status of our various defined benefit pension plans and the impact of any increased pension funding resulting from those changes;   

changes in the competitive environment;   

our ability to implement restructuring initiatives and other initiatives intended to yield cost savings and the ability to achieve those cost savings;   

the impact on risk and insurance services commission revenues of changes in the availability of, and the premium insurance carriers charge for, insurance and reinsurance products, including the impact on premium rates and market capacity attributable to catastrophic events;   

7 

the outcome of inquiries from regulators and investigations related to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws;   

the impact of investigations brought by U.S. state attorneys general, U.S. state insurance regulators, U.S. federal prosecutors, U.S. federal regulators, and regulatory authorities in the U.K. and other countries;   

the impact of class actions and individual lawsuits including client class actions, securities class actions, derivative actions and ERISA class actions;   

the cost of resolution of other contingent liabilities and loss contingencies, including potential liabilities arising from errors and omissions claims against us;   

the extent to which we retain existing clients and attract new business, and our ability to incentivize and retain key employees;   

the impact of, and potential challenges in complying with, legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate, particularly given the global scope of our businesses and the possibility of conflicting regulatory requirements across jurisdictions in which we do business; and   

our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Benfield merger.   

 Any or all of our forward-looking statements may turn out to be inaccurate, and there are no guarantees about our performance. The factors identified above are not exhaustive. Aon and its subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the dates on which they are made. We are under no obligation (and expressly disclaim any obligation) to update or alter any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Further information about factors that could materially affect Aon, including our results of operations and financial condition, is contained in the "Risk Factors" section in Part I, Item 1A of this report.
