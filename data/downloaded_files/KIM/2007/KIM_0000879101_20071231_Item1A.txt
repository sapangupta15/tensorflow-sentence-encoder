Item 1A. Risk Factors 

We are subject to certain business risks including, among other factors, the following: 

Loss of our tax status as a real estate investment trust could have significant adverse consequences to us and the value of our securities. 

We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes under the Code. We currently intend to operate so as to qualify as a REIT and believe that our current organization and method of operation complies with the rules and regulations promulgated under the federal income tax code to enable us to qualify as a REIT. 

Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex federal income tax code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. New legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments. There can be no assurance that we have qualified or will continue to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes. 

If we lose our REIT status, we will face serious tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available to pay dividends to stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT: 

· 

we would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates; 

· 

we could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes;  

13 

· 

unless we were entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which we were disqualified; and 

· 

we would not be required to make distributions to stockholders. 

As a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT could impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital, and could adversely affect the value of our securities. 

Adverse market conditions and competition may impede our ability to generate sufficient income to pay expenses and maintain properties. 

The economic performance and value of our properties is subject to all of the risks associated with owning and operating real estate including: 

· 

changes in the national, regional and local economic climate; 

· 

local conditions, including an oversupply of, or a reduction in demand for, space in properties like those that we own; 

· 

the attractiveness of our properties to tenants; 

· 

the ability of tenants to pay rent; 

· 

competition from other available properties; 

· 

changes in market rental rates; 

· 

the need to periodically pay for costs to repair, renovate and re-let space; 

· 

changes in operating costs, including costs for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes; 

· 

the fact that the expenses of owning and operating properties are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the properties; and 

· 

changes in laws and governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes. 

Downturns in the retailing industry likely will have a direct impact on our performance. 

Our properties consist primarily of community and neighborhood shopping centers and other retail properties. Our performance therefore is linked to economic conditions in the market for retail space generally. The market for retail space could in the future be adversely affected by: 

· 

weakness in the national, regional and local economies;  

· 

the adverse financial condition of some large retailing companies;  

· 

ongoing consolidation in the retail sector; 

· 

the excess amount of retail space in a number of markets; and 

· 

increasing consumer purchases through catalogues and the internet.  

Failure by any anchor tenant with leases in multiple locations to make rental payments to us because of a deterioration of its financial condition or otherwise, could impact our performance. 

14 

Our performance depends on our ability to collect rent from tenants. At any time, our tenants may experience a downturn in their business that may significantly weaken their financial condition. As a result, our tenants may delay a number of lease commencements, decline to extend or renew leases upon expiration, fail to make rental payments when due, close stores or declare bankruptcy. Any of these actions could result in the termination of the tenants leases and the loss of rental income attributable to the terminated leases. In addition, lease terminations by an anchor tenant or a failure by that anchor tenant to occupy the premises could result in lease terminations or reductions in rent by other tenants in the same shopping centers under the terms of some leases. In that event, we may be unable to re-lease the vacated space at attractive rents or at all. The occurrence of any of the situations described above, particularly if it involves a substantial tenant with leases in multiple locations, could impact our performance. 

We may be unable to collect balances due from tenants in bankruptcy. 

A tenant that files for bankruptcy protection may not continue to pay us rent. A bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar all efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from the tenant or the lease guarantor, or their property, unless the bankruptcy court permits us to do so. A tenant or lease guarantor bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. If a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims it holds, if at all. 

We may be unable to sell our real estate property investments when appropriate or on favorable terms. 

Real estate property investments are illiquid and generally cannot be disposed of quickly. In addition, the federal tax code imposes restrictions on a REITs ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies. Therefore, we may not be able to vary its portfolio in response to economic or other conditions promptly or on favorable terms. 

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies and this may create risks. 

We may acquire or develop properties or acquire other real estate related companies when we believe that an acquisition or development is consistent with our business strategies. We may not succeed in consummating desired acquisitions or in completing developments on time or within budget. We face competition in pursuing these acquisition or development opportunities that could increase our costs. When we do pursue a project or acquisition, we may not succeed in leasing newly developed or acquired properties at rents sufficient to cover the costs of acquisition or development and operations. Difficulties in integrating acquisitions may prove costly or time-consuming and could divert managements attention. Acquisitions or developments in new markets or industries where we do not have the same level of market knowledge may result in poorer than anticipated performance. We may also abandon acquisition or development opportunities that it has begun pursuing and consequently fail to recover expenses already incurred and have devoted management time to a matter not consummated. Furthermore, our acquisitions of new properties or companies will expose us to the liabilities of those properties or companies, some of which we may not be aware at the time of acquisition. In addition, development of our existing properties presents similar risks. 

There is a lack of operating history with respect to our recent acquisitions and development of properties and we may not succeed in the integration or management of additional properties. 

These properties may have characteristics or deficiencies currently unknown to us that affect their value or revenue potential. It is also possible that the operating performance of these properties may decline under our management. As we acquire additional properties, we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties, including lease-up and tenant retention. In addition, our ability to manage our growth effectively will require us to successfully integrate our new acquisitions into our existing management structure. We may not succeed with this integration or effectively manage additional properties. Also, newly acquired properties may not perform as expected. 

We do not have exclusive control over our joint venture and preferred equity investments, such that we are unable to ensure that our objectives will be pursued. 

15 

We have invested in some cases as a co-venturer or partner in properties instead of owning directly. In these investments, we do not have exclusive control over the development, financing, leasing, management and other aspects of these investments. As a result, the co-venturer or partner might have interests or goals that are inconsistent with us, take action contrary to our interests or otherwise impede our objectives. The co-venturer or partner also might become insolvent or bankrupt. 

We may not be able to recover our investments in our joint venture or preferred equity investments, which may result in losses to us. 

Our joint venture and preferred equity investments generally own real estate properties for which the economic performance and value is subject to all the risks associated with owning and operating real estate as described above. 

We have significant international operations that carry additional risks. 

We invest in, and conduct operations outside the United States. The risks we face in international business operations include, but are not limited to: 

· 

currency risks, including currency fluctuations; 

· 

unexpected changes in legislative and regulatory requirements; 

· 

potential adverse tax burdens; 

· 

burdens of complying with different permitting standards, labor laws and a wide variety of foreign laws; 

· 

obstacles to the repatriation of earnings and cash; 

· 

regional, national and local political uncertainty; 

· 

economic slowdown and/or downturn in foreign markets; 

· 

difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and 

· 

reduced protection for intellectual property in some countries. 

Each of these risks might impact our cash flow or impair our ability to borrow funds, which ultimately could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 

We may be unable to obtain financing through the debt and equities market, which may have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy, our results of operations, and our financial condition.  

Market conditions may make it difficult to obtain financing, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing or that we will be able to obtain it on favorable terms. The inability to obtain financing could have negative effects on our business, such as: 

· 

We could have difficulty acquiring or developing properties, which could materially adversely affect our business strategy; 

· 

Our liquidity could be adversely affected; 

· 

We may be unable to repay or refinance our indebtedness; 

· 

We may need to make higher interest and principal payments or sell some of our assets on unfavorable terms to fund our indebtedness; and 

· 

We may need to issue additional capital stock, which could further dilute the ownership of our existing shareholders. 

Financial covenants to which we are subject may restrict our operating and acquisition activities. 

Our revolving credit facilities and the indentures under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contain certain financial and operating covenants, including, among other things, certain coverage ratios, as well as limitations on our ability to incur debt, make dividend payments, sell all or substantially all of our assets and engage in mergers and consolidations and certain acquisitions. These covenants may restrict our ability to pursue certain business initiatives or certain acquisition transactions that might otherwise be advantageous. In addition, failure to meet any of the financial covenants could cause an event of default under and/or accelerate some or all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on us. 

We may be subject to environmental regulations. 

Under various federal, state, and local laws, ordinances and regulations, we may be considered an owner or operator of real property and may be responsible for paying for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances released on or in our property, as well as certain other potential costs which could relate to hazardous or toxic substances (including governmental fines and injuries to persons and property). This liability may be imposed whether or not we knew about, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous or toxic substances. 

We face competition in leasing or developing properties. 

16 

We face competition in the acquisition, development, operation and sale of real property from others engaged in real estate investment. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than us. This results in competition for the acquisition of properties for tenants who lease or consider leasing space in our existing and subsequently acquired properties and for other real estate investment opportunities. 

Changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our publicly traded securities. 

As with other publicly traded securities, the market price of our publicly traded securities depends on various market conditions, which may change from time-to-time. Among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following: 

· 

the extent of institutional investor interest in us; 

· 

the reputation of REITs generally and the reputation of REITs with portfolios similar to us; 

· 

the attractiveness of the securities of REITs in comparison to securities issued by other entities (including securities issued by other real estate companies); 

· 

our financial condition and performance; 

· 

the markets perception of our growth potential and potential future cash dividends; 

· 

an increase in market interest rates, which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares; and 

· 

general economic and financial market conditions. 

We may not be able to recover our investments in marketable securities or mortgage receivables, which may result in losses to us. 

Our investments in marketable securities are subject to specific risks relating to the particular issuer of the securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer, which may result in losses to us. Marketable securities are generally unsecured and may also be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. As a result, investments in marketable securities are subject to risks of: 

· 

limited liquidity in the secondary trading market; 

· 

substantial market price volatility resulting from changes in prevailing interest rates; 

· 

subordination to the prior claims of banks and other senior lenders to the issuer; 

· 

the possibility that earnings of the issuer may be insufficient to meet its debt service and distribution obligations; and 

· 

the declining creditworthiness and potential for insolvency of the issuer during periods of rising interest rates and economic downturn.  

These risks may adversely affect the value of outstanding marketable securities and the ability of the issuers to make distribution payments.  

We invest in mortgage receivables. Our investments in mortgage receivables normally are not insured or otherwise guaranteed by any institution or agency. In the event of a default by a borrower it may be necessary for us to foreclose our mortgage or engage in costly negotiations. Delays in liquidating defaulted mortgage loans and repossessing and selling the underlying properties could reduce our investment returns. Furthermore, in the event of default, the actual value of the property securing the mortgage may decrease. A decline in real estate values will adversely affect the value of our loans and the value of the mortgages securing our loans. 

17 

Our mortgage receivables may be or become subordinated to mechanics' or materialmen's liens or property tax liens. In these instances we may need to protect a particular investment by making payments to maintain the current status of a prior lien or discharge it entirely. In these cases, the total amount we recover may be less than our total investment, resulting in a loss. In the event of a major loan default or several loan defaults resulting in losses, our investments in mortgage receivables would be materially and adversely affected.
