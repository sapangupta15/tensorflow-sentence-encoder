ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

American Airlines Group  

American Airlines and American Eagle offer an average of nearly 6,700 flights per day to nearly 350 destinations in more than 50 countries. American has hubs in Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. American is a founding member of the oneworld alliance, whose members and members-elect serve nearly 1,000 destinations with 14,250 daily flights to 150 countries. In 2015, approximately 201 million passengers boarded our mainline and regional flights. As of December 31, 2015, we operated 946 mainline aircraft and were supported by our regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers, which operated an additional 587 regional aircraft.  

As previously discussed, our Merger was consummated on December 9, 2013. Since the Merger, we have made significant progress towards completing our integration. During 2015, we achieved the following:  

       Adopted a single reservations system, which when completed, resulted in no operational or customer disruption  

       Reached ratified contracts with industry-leading pay rates for pilots, flight attendants and customer service and reservation agents  

       Received a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing American to be regulated as one airline  

       Merged loyalty programs by moving US Airways Dividend Miles members into AAdvantage  

       Opened the new state-of-the-art Robert W. Baker Integrated Operations Center in Fort Worth  

       Optimized the airlines flight schedules at Chicago OHare International Airport and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport  

       Substantially completed the co-location of our airport operations and consolidated all mainline operations at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport into three terminals, gaining efficiencies in gate use and line maintenance  

       Announced plans to masterplan our Fort Worth campus and build a new corporate headquarters building to begin the process of modernizing our facilities and co-locate our headquarters staff with our training functions and integrated operations support teams  

Year in Review  

The U.S. Airline Industry  

In 2015, the U.S. airline industry benefited significantly from lower fuel prices. However, this benefit was offset in part by a decline in revenues driven by reduced yields.  

Jet fuel prices closely follow the price of Brent crude oil. Oil prices declined significantly throughout 2015, and in December, the price of Brent crude oil fell below $40 a barrel for the first time since 2009. On average, the price of Brent crude oil per barrel was approximately 47% lower in 2015 as compared to 2014. The average daily spot price for Brent crude oil during 2015 was $52 per barrel as compared to an average daily spot price of $99 per barrel during 2014. On a daily basis, Brent crude oil prices fluctuated during 2015 between a high of $66 per barrel to a low of $35 per barrel, and closed the year on December 31, 2015 at $37 per barrel.  

With respect to revenue, in its most recent data available through the third quarter of 2015, Airlines for America, the trade association for U.S. airlines, reported U.S. industry passenger revenues and yields declined as compared to 2014. Additionally, domestic markets outperformed international markets (Atlantic, Pacific and Latin America) in both yield and overall revenue performance.

While jet fuel prices have declined year-over-year as described above, uncertainty exists regarding the economic conditions driving these declines. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  Downturns in economic conditions adversely affect our business and Our business is dependent on the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Continued periods of high volatility in fuel costs, increased fuel prices and significant disruptions in the supply of aircraft fuel could have a significant negative impact on our operating results and liquidity.  

American Airlines Group  

Driven by substantially lower fuel costs, we realized operating income of $6.2 billion and net income of $7.6 billion in 2015. This compares to operating income of $4.2 billion and net income of $2.9 billion in 2014. As a result of not hedging our fuel consumption, we fully benefited from the decline in fuel prices.  

Excluding the effects of net special charges (credits), we recognized operating income of $7.3 billion and net income of $6.3 billion in 2015 as compared to operating income of $5.1 billion and net income of $4.2 billion in 2014. This represents improvements of 44% and 50%, respectively, in operating income and net income in 2015.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  AAGs 2015 results were impacted by a net special credit of $1.3 billion, consisting principally of a $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit related to the reversal of the Companys valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets. This credit was offset in part by $1.1 billion of operating special charges, consisting principally of merger integration expenses and a $592 million charge related to a write off of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held. See Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  AAGs Results of Operations of this report for more information on net special items.  

Revenue  

In 2015, we reported operating revenues of $41.0 billion. Mainline and regional passenger revenues were $35.5 billion, a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 4.3%, as compared to 2014. The decline in revenues was driven by a 6.5% decrease in yield due to competitive growth in certain domestic markets, including Dallas/Fort Worth and international weakness resulting from foreign currency devaluation relative to the U.S. dollar, lower fuel surcharges, and continued economic softness in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Venezuela. Our mainline and regional passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) was 13.21 cents in 2015, a 5.4% decrease, as compared to 13.97 cents in 2014.

Table of Contents 

Fuel  

Mainline and regional fuel expense totaled $7.5 billion in 2015, which was $5.1 billion, or 40.8%, lower as compared to 2014. This decrease was driven by a 40.7% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.72 in 2015 from $2.91 in 2014.  

As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any fuel hedging contracts outstanding to hedge our fuel consumption. As such, and assuming we do not enter into any future transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, we will continue to be fully exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices. Our current policy is not to enter into transactions to hedge our fuel consumption, although we review that policy from time to time based on market conditions and other factors.  

Cost Control  

We remain committed to actively managing our cost structure, which we believe is necessary in an industry whose economic prospects are heavily dependent upon two variables we cannot control: the health of the economy and the price of fuel. Our 2015 mainline cost per available seat mile (CASM) excluding special items and fuel was 8.99 cents, an increase of 4.2% as compared to 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher salaries, wages and benefits driven by new merger related labor contracts with industry-leading pay rates. See below for the Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Information to Non-GAAP Financial Information.  

Customer Service  

We are committed to consistently delivering safe, reliable and convenient service to our customers in every aspect of our operation. The table below summarizes the operating statistics we reported to the DOT for our mainline operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We are working to improve these metrics by making investments in our operations, which include the hiring of additional maintenance personnel to reduce the time aircraft are out of service. We are also making capital investments in new baggage handling technology.

 (c)  Rate of mishandled baggage reports per 1,000 passengers.  

 (d)  Rate of customer complaints filed with the DOT per 100,000 enplanements.  

Liquidity Position  

As of December 31, 2015, AAGs total cash, short-term investments and restricted cash and short-term investments were $6.9 billion, of which $695 million was restricted. We also had $2.4 billion of undrawn revolving line of credit facilities.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

 (1)  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a $592 million special charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us, due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. During 2014, we significantly reduced capacity in the Venezuelan market and we no longer accept bolivars as payment for airline tickets.  

 (2)  Restricted cash and short-term investments primarily include cash collateral to secure workers compensation obligations.  

In 2015, we utilized cash generated from operations to invest in our airline. We continued our fleet renewal program by investing more than $5.3 billion in new aircraft, which has provided us with the youngest and most modern fleet of the U.S. network airlines. In 2015, we took delivery of 75 new mainline aircraft while retiring 112 aircraft. We also added 52 regional aircraft to our fleet and removed 31 regional aircraft.  

In 2015, we returned $3.9 billion to our shareholders through the payment of $278 million in quarterly dividends and the repurchase of $3.6 billion of common stock, or 85.1 million shares. In addition, in 2015 we elected to pay approximately $306 million in satisfaction of certain tax withholding obligations associated with equity awards, further reducing the share count by 7.0 million.  

These cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from financing transactions, principally aircraft related. We ended the year with $8.7 billion in available liquidity (including available lines of credit). We believe it is important to retain liquidity levels above our network peers as we expect capital expenditures of approximately $4.5 billion in each of 2016 and 2017 as we continue our fleet renewal program. See Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Commitments for further discussion of 2015 financing transactions and our contractual commitments.  

2016 Outlook  

We have taken significant actions to restore our competitiveness and to complete our integration. Although it is difficult to predict the price of oil or the strength of the economy, we believe that our 2015 financial results are evidence of the substantial progress we have made and can continue to build on.

Reconciliation of GAAP Financial Information to Non-GAAP Financial Information  

We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors as both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and the exclusion of special items provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.

AAGs Results of Operations  

In 2015, we realized operating income of $6.2 billion and net income of $7.6 billion. Our 2015 net income included net special operating charges of $1.1 billion and total net special credits of $1.3 billion. Excluding the effects of these special charges and credits, we realized operating income of $7.3 billion and net income of $6.3 billion.  

In 2014, we realized operating income of $4.2 billion and net income of $2.9 billion. Our 2014 net income included net special operating charges of $824 million and total net special charges of $1.3 billion. Excluding the effects of these special charges, we realized operating income of $5.1 billion and net income of $4.2 billion.  

We completed the Merger on December 9, 2013. Under GAAP, AAGs results do not include the financial results of US Airways Group prior to the closing of the Merger. Accordingly, our 2014 period GAAP results are not comparable to the GAAP results for 2013 as 2013 excludes the results of US Airways Group except for the 23 day post-Merger period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013.  

In 2013, we realized operating income of $1.4 billion and net loss of $1.8 billion. Our 2013 net income included net special operating charges of $536 million and total net special charges of $3.1 billion. Excluding the effects of these special charges, we realized operating income of $1.9 billion and net income of $1.2 billion.

Table of Contents 

The components of total net special charges (credits) in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations are as follows (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  In 2013, other revenue special item, net included a credit to other revenues related to a change in accounting method resulting from the modification of Americans AAdvantage miles agreement with Citibank.  

 (2)  In 2015, mainline operating special items, net principally included $1.0 billion of merger integration expenses related to information technology, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance, share-based compensation, fleet restructuring, re-branding of aircraft and airport facilities, relocation and training.  

In 2014, mainline operating special items, net principally included $810 million of merger integration expenses related to information technology, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance and retention, share-based compensation, divestiture of London Heathrow slots, fleet restructuring, re-branding of aircraft and airport facilities, relocation and training. In addition, we recorded a net charge of $81 million for bankruptcy related items principally consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy settlement obligations and an $81 million charge to revise prior estimates of certain aircraft residual values and other spare parts asset impairments. These charges were offset in part by a $309 million gain on the sale of slots at DCA.  

In 2013, mainline operating special items, net included $443 million of merger related expenses related to the alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance, share-based compensation and fees for US Airways to exit the Star Alliance and its codeshare agreement with United Airlines. In addition, we recorded a $107 million charge related to Americans pilot long-term disability obligation, a $43 million charge for workers compensation claims and a $33 million aircraft impairment charge. These charges were offset in part by a $67 million gain on the sale of slots at LGA.  

 (3)  The 2015 regional operating special items, net principally related to merger integration expenses.  

The 2014 regional operating special items, net consisted primarily of a $24 million charge due to a new pilot labor contract at our Envoy regional subsidiary as well as $7 million of merger integration expenses, offset in part by an $8 million gain on the sale of certain spare parts.  

 (4)  In 2015, nonoperating special items, net principally included a $592 million charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela.  

In 2014, nonoperating special items, net principally included a $43 million charge for Venezuelan foreign currency losses, $56 million of early debt extinguishment costs primarily related to the prepayment of 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness and $33 million of non-cash interest accretion on bankruptcy settlement obligations.  

In 2013, nonoperating special items, net consisted of interest charges of $138 million primarily to recognize post-petition interest expense on unsecured obligations pursuant to the Plan and penalty interest related to 10.5% secured notes and 7.50% senior secured notes, a $54 million charge related to the premium on tender for existing EETC financings and the write-off of debt issuance costs and $19 million in charges related to the repayment of existing EETC financings.

Table of Contents 

 (5)  In 2013, we recognized reorganization expenses as a result of the filing of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11. These amounts consisted primarily of estimated allowed claim amounts and professional fees.  

 (6)  In 2015, income tax special items totaled a net credit of $3.0 billion. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets, which include our NOLs, would be realized. Accordingly, we reversed $3.0 billion of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, which resulted in a special $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for 2015.  

In 2014, income tax special items, net were $346 million. During 2014, we sold our portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. In connection with this sale, we recorded a special non-cash tax provision of $330 million in the second quarter of 2014 that reversed the non-cash tax provision which was recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI), a subset of stockholders equity, principally in 2009. This provision represents the tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of our fuel hedging contracts. In accordance with GAAP, we retained the $330 million tax provision in OCI until the last contract was settled or terminated.  

In 2013, income tax special items, net included a $538 million non-cash income tax benefit from continuing operations. We are required to consider all items (including items recorded in OCI) in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that should be allocated to continuing operations. As a result, we recorded a tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations for the year, which was exactly offset by income tax expense on OCI. However, while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported on the income statement, the income tax expense on OCI is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of stockholders equity. Because the income tax expense on OCI is equal to the income tax benefit from continuing operations, our year-end net deferred tax position is not impacted by this tax allocation. The 2013 tax benefit was offset in part by a $214 million tax charge attributable to additional valuation allowance required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believed was more likely than not to be realized.  

Income Taxes  

At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $8.0 billion of gross NOL Carryforwards to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2016. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in 2023 if unused. These NOL Carryforwards include an unrealized tax benefit of $1.2 billion related to share-based compensation that will be recorded in equity when realized. We also had approximately $4.0 billion of NOL Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2015, which will expire in years 2016 through 2034 if unused. Our ability to deduct our NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 where an ownership change has occurred. We experienced an ownership change in connection with our emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, and US Airways Group experienced an ownership change in connection with the Merger. As a result of the Merger, US Airways Group is now included in the AAG consolidated federal and state income tax returns. The general limitation rules of Section 382 for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. We elected to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that permitted approximately $9.0 billion (with $6.6 billion of unlimited NOL remaining at December 31, 2015) of our federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the Section 382 annual limitation rules unless a second ownership change occurred on or before December 9, 2015. No second ownership change occurred within that period. Substantially all of our remaining federal NOL Carryforwards (attributable to US Airways Group) are subject to limitation under Section 382; however, our ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. Our ability to utilize any new NOL Carryforwards arising after the ownership changes is not affected by the annual limitation rules imposed by Section 382 unless another ownership change occurs.

Table of Contents 

At December 31, 2015, we had an Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credit carryforward of approximately $341 million available for federal income tax purposes, which is available for an indefinite period.  

In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that it was more likely than not that substantially all of our deferred tax assets, which include our NOLs, would be realized. Accordingly, we reversed $3.0 billion of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, which resulted in a special $3.0 billion non-cash tax benefit recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for 2015.  

Beginning in 2016, we expect to record income tax expense with an effective rate of approximately 38%, which will be substantially non-cash as we utilize the NOLs described above to offset cash income taxes due.  

For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded a $330 million tax provision, which included $346 million of special tax charges as described above.  

For the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded a $346 million tax benefit, which included $324 million of net special tax benefits as described above.

Operating Revenues  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating revenues in 2015 decreased $1.7 billion, or 3.9%, from 2014 principally due to competitive growth and weaker international yields primarily due to foreign currency devaluation relative to the U.S. dollar. Significant changes in the components of operating revenues are as follows:  

       Mainline passenger revenues were $29.0 billion in 2015 as compared to $30.8 billion in 2014. Mainline RPMs increased 2.0% as mainline capacity, as measured by ASMs, increased 0.8%, resulting in a 0.9 point increase in load factor to 83.3%. Mainline passenger yield decreased 7.5% to 14.56 cents in 2015 from 15.74 cents in 2014. Mainline PRASM decreased 6.5% to 12.13 cents in 2015 from 12.97 cents in 2014.  

       Regional passenger revenues were $6.5 billion in 2015 as compared to $6.3 billion in 2014. Regional RPMs increased 6.0% as regional capacity, as measured by ASMs, increased 4.4%, resulting in a 1.2  

68  

Table of Contents 

     point increase in load factor to 80.2%. Regional passenger yield decreased 3.3% to 27.50 cents in 2015 from 28.46 cents in 2014. Regional PRASM decreased 1.9% to 22.05 cents in 2015 from 22.47 cents in 2014.  

       Cargo revenue decreased $115 million, or 13.1%, in 2015 from 2014 driven primarily by a decrease in international freight yields.  

Operating Expenses  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating expenses were $34.8 billion in 2015, a decrease of $3.6 billion, or 9.4%, from 2014. The decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to substantially lower aircraft fuel costs, offset in part by higher salaries, wages and benefits driven by new merger related labor contracts. See detailed explanations below relating to changes in operating costs per ASM.  

Mainline Operating Expenses per ASM  

Our mainline CASM decreased 1.39 cents, or 10.4%, from 13.42 cents in 2014 to 12.03 cents in 2015 on 0.8% increase in capacity primarily due to lower fuel prices. Excluding special items and aircraft fuel and related taxes, our mainline CASM increased 0.36 cents, or 4.2%, from 8.63 cents in 2014 to 8.99 cents in 2015, primarily due to higher salaries, wages and benefits due to new merger related labor contracts.  

69  

Table of Contents 

The table below sets forth the major components of our total mainline CASM and our mainline CASM excluding special items and aircraft fuel and related taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  We believe that the presentation of mainline CASM excluding fuel is useful to investors because both the cost and availability of fuel are subject to many economic and political factors beyond our control, and the exclusion of special items provides investors the ability to measure financial performance in a way that is more indicative of our ongoing performance and that is more comparable to measures reported by other major airlines. Management uses mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel to evaluate our operating performance. Amounts may not recalculate due to rounding.  

Significant changes in the components of mainline operating expense per ASM are as follows:  

       Aircraft fuel and related taxes per ASM decreased 41.7% primarily due to a 40.7% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.72 in 2015 from an average price per gallon of $2.91 in 2014.  

       Salaries, wages and benefits per ASM increased 11.1% primarily due to increased costs associated with the new, merger related pilot, flight attendant and customer service and reservation agent joint collective bargaining agreements.  

       Maintenance, materials and repairs per ASM decreased 8.6% primarily due to fewer engine overhauls in 2015, driven by our fleet renewal program.  

       Selling expenses per ASM decreased 10.5% primarily due to lower contractually negotiated rates for certain commissions and booking fees as well as lower revenues in 2015.  

       Other operating expenses per ASM increased 5.4% in 2015 as compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in crew travel and certain information technology projects, as well as enhancements to our aircraft food and catering offerings.  

Regional Operating Expenses  

Total regional expenses decreased $533 million, or 8.2%, in 2015 to $6.0 billion from $6.5 billion in 2014. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a $779 million, or 38.8%, decrease in fuel costs, offset in part by a $246 million, or 5.4%, increase in other regional operating expenses. The average price per gallon of fuel decreased 40.9% to $1.73 in 2015 from $2.92 in 2014. The increase in other regional operating expenses was principally due to increased flying under capacity purchase agreements.

Nonoperating Income (Expense)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments that provided nominal returns.  

The following table provides the components of interest expense:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other nonoperating expense, net in 2015 included a net $594 million in other nonoperating special charges and $159 million of foreign currency losses. The other nonoperating special charges were primarily due to a $592 million write off of all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela and $41 million in charges principally related to non-cash write offs of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs associated with refinancing certain of our secured term loan facilities, prepayments of certain aircraft financings and the purchase and subsequent remarketing of certain special facility revenue bonds. These charges were offset in part by a $22 million gain associated with the sale of an investment and a $17 million early debt extinguishment gain associated with the repayment of Americans AAdvantage loan with Citibank. The foreign currency losses were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies during 2015, principally in Latin American and European markets, including a 34% decrease in the value of the Argentinian peso, a 30% decrease in the value of the Brazilian real, a 14% decrease in the value of the Mexican peso, a 10% decrease in the value of the Euro and a 5% decrease in the value of the British pound.  

Other nonoperating expense, net in 2014 consisted of $114 million of net foreign currency losses, including a $43 million special charge for Venezuelan foreign currency losses, and $56 million in other nonoperating special charges primarily due to early debt extinguishment costs related to the prepayment of our 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness. The foreign currency losses were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies during 2014, principally in the Latin American market, including a 48% decrease in the value of the Venezuelan bolivar and a 14% decrease in the value of the Brazilian real.

Operating Revenues  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The following discussion of operating revenues excludes the results of the Merger in order to provide a more meaningful year-over-year comparison.  

Total operating revenues in 2014 increased $1.4 billion, or 5.4%, from 2013, which was driven by strong demand for air travel. Significant changes in the components of operating revenues, excluding the results of the Merger, are as follows:  

       Mainline passenger revenues increased $751 million, or 3.8%, in 2014 from 2013 due to higher yields and ASMs, offset in part by slightly lower load factors.  

       Cargo revenues increased $41 million, or 6.1%, in 2014 from 2013 driven primarily by an increase in international freight volumes.  

       Other revenues increased $624 million, or 23.9%, in 2014 from 2013 driven primarily by higher revenues associated with our loyalty programs driven by our affinity card agreement with Citibank.

The following discussion of operating expenses excludes the results of the Merger in order to provide a more meaningful year-over-year comparison.  

Total operating expenses in 2014 increased $641 million, or 2.6%, from 2013. Significant changes in the components of mainline operating expenses, excluding the results of the Merger, are as follows:  

       Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased $437 million, or 5.7%, in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to a decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel.  

       Salaries, wages and benefits increased $395 million, or 7.5%, in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to increased costs associated with merger related labor contracts.  

       Maintenance, materials and repairs increased $112 million, or 9.2%, in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in the rate per engine overhaul.  

       Aircraft rent increased $117 million, or 15.7%, in 2014 from 2013 primarily as a result of new leased aircraft deliveries in 2014 as we continued our fleet renewal program.  

       Depreciation and amortization increased $67 million, or 7.9%, in 2014 from 2013 primarily as a result of new purchased aircraft deliveries since the end of 2013 as we continued our fleet renewal program.  

Regional Operating Expenses  

Total regional expenses, excluding the results of the Merger, increased $85 million, or 2.8%, in 2014 from 2013. Other regional operating expenses increased $143 million, or 7.0%, primarily due to higher expenses associated with certain capacity purchase agreements, offset by a $58 million, or 5.4%, decrease in fuel costs as a result of a decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel.  

Nonoperating Income (Expense)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest income was $31 million and $20 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our short-term investments in each period consisted of highly liquid investments, which provided nominal returns.

The following discussion of nonoperating income and expense excludes the results of the Merger in order to provide a more meaningful year-over-year comparison.  

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest decreased $249 million in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to a $149 million decrease in special charges recognized year-over-year as further described below, as well as refinancing activities that resulted in $100 million less interest expense recognized in 2014.  

 (1)  In 2014, we recognized $33 million of special charges relating to non-cash interest accretion on bankruptcy settlement obligations. In 2013, we recognized $138 million of special charges relating to post-petition interest expense on unsecured obligations pursuant to the Plan and penalty interest related to Americans 10.5% secured notes and 7.50% senior secured notes. In addition, in 2013 we recorded special charges of $44 million for debt extinguishment costs incurred as a result of the repayment of certain aircraft secured indebtedness, including cash interest charges and non-cash write offs of unamortized debt issuance costs.  

 (2)  As a result of the 2013 refinancing activities and the early extinguishment of Americans 7.50% senior secured notes in 2014, we recognized $100 million less interest expense in 2014 as compared to 2013.  

Other nonoperating expense, net in 2014 consisted of $114 million of net foreign currency losses, including a $43 million special charge for Venezuelan foreign currency losses, and $56 million in other nonoperating special charges primarily due to early debt extinguishment costs related to the prepayment of our 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness. The foreign currency losses were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies during 2014, principally in the Latin American market, including a 48% decrease in the value of the Venezuelan bolivar and a 14% decrease in the value of the Brazilian real.  

Other nonoperating expense, net in 2013 consisted principally of net foreign currency losses of $56 million and early debt extinguishment charges of $29 million.  

Reorganization Items, Net  

Reorganization items refer to revenues, expenses (including professional fees), realized gains and losses and provisions for losses that are realized or incurred as a direct result of the Chapter 11 Cases. The following table summarizes the components included in reorganization items, net on AAGs consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  In exchange for employees contributions to the successful reorganization, including agreeing to reductions in pay and benefits, we agreed in the Plan to provide each employee group a deemed claim, which was used to provide a distribution of a portion of the equity of the reorganized entity to those employees. Each employee group received a deemed claim amount based upon a portion of the value of cost savings provided by that group through reductions to pay and benefits as well as through certain work rule changes. The total value of this deemed claim was approximately $1.7 billion.  

 (2)  Amounts include allowed claims (claims approved by the Bankruptcy Court) and estimated allowed claims relating to (i) the rejection or modification of financings related to aircraft and (ii) entry of orders treated as unsecured claims with respect to facility agreements supporting certain issuances of special facility revenue bonds. The Debtors recorded an estimated claim associated with the rejection or modification of a financing

     or facility agreement when the applicable motion was filed with the Bankruptcy Court to reject or modify such financing or facility agreement and the Debtors believed that it was probable the motion would be approved, and there was sufficient information to estimate the claim. See Note 2 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A for further information.  

 (3)  Pursuant to the Plan, the Debtors agreed to allow certain post-petition unsecured claims on obligations. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded reorganization charges to adjust estimated allowed claim amounts previously recorded on rejected special facility revenue bonds of $180 million, allowed general unsecured claims related to the 1990 and 1994 series of special facility revenue bonds that financed certain improvements at JFK, and rejected bonds that financed certain improvements at ORD, which are included in the table above.  

 (4)  The Plan allowed unsecured creditors receiving AAG Series A Preferred Stock a conversion discount of 3.5%. Accordingly, we recorded the fair value of such discount upon the confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court.  

Americans Results of Operations  

On December 30, 2015, in order to simplify AAGs internal corporate structure and as part of the integration efforts following the business combination of AAG and US Airways Group, US Airways merged with and into American, with American as the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger of US Airways and American, US Airways transferred all of its assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments to American. For financial reporting purposes, this transaction constituted a transfer of assets between entities under common control and was accounted for at historical cost. As a result, Americans consolidated financial statements as well as this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (unless otherwise indicated) are presented as though the transaction had occurred on December 9, 2013, when a subsidiary of AMR merged with and into US Airways Group, which represents the earliest date that American and US Airways were under common control. Thus, the full years of 2015 and 2014 and the period from December 9, 2013 to December 31, 2013 are comprised of the financial data of American and US Airways. The periods prior to December 9, 2013 are comprised of the financial data of American only.  

In 2015, American realized operating income of $6.2 billion and net income of $8.1 billion. Americans 2015 net income included net special operating charges of $1.1 billion and total net special credits of $1.8 billion. Excluding the effects of these special charges and credits, American realized operating income of $7.3 billion and net income of $6.3 billion.  

In 2014, American realized operating income of $4.3 billion and net income of $2.9 billion. Americans 2014 net income included net special operating charges of $788 million and total net special charges of $1.3 billion. Excluding the effects of these special charges, American realized operating income of $5.1 billion and net income of $4.2 billion.  

In 2013, American realized operating income of $1.4 billion and a net loss of $1.7 billion. Americans 2013 net loss included net special operating charges of $528 million and total net special charges of $3.0 billion. Excluding the effects of these charges, American realized operating income of $1.9 billion and net income of $1.2 billion.

The components of Americans total net special charges (credits) included in Americans accompanying consolidated statements of operations are as follows (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  In 2013, other revenue special item, net included a credit to other revenues related to a change in accounting method resulting from the modification of Americans AAdvantage miles agreement with Citibank.  

 (2)  In 2015, mainline operating special items, net principally included $1.0 billion of merger integration expenses related to information technology, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance, share-based compensation, fleet restructuring, re-branding of aircraft and airport facilities, relocation and training.  

In 2014, mainline operating special items, net principally included $803 million of merger integration expenses related to information technology, alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance and retention, share-based compensation, divestiture of London Heathrow slots, fleet restructuring, re-branding of aircraft and airport facilities, relocation and training. In addition, American recorded a net charge of $60 million for bankruptcy related items principally consisting of fair value adjustments for bankruptcy settlement obligations and an $81 million charge to revise prior estimates of certain aircraft residual values and other spare parts asset impairments. These charges were offset in part by a $309 million gain on the sale of slots at DCA.  

In 2013, mainline operating special items, net principally included $443 million of merger related expenses related to the alignment of labor union contracts, professional fees, severance, share-based compensation and fees for US Airways to exit the Star Alliance and its codeshare agreement with United Airlines. In addition, American recorded a $107 million charge related to Americans pilot long-term disability obligation, a $43 million charge for workers compensation claims and a $33 million aircraft impairment charge. These charges were offset in part by a $67 million gain on the sale of slots at LGA.  

 (3)  The 2015 and 2014 regional operating special items, net principally related to merger integration expenses.  

 (4)  In 2015, nonoperating special items, net principally included a $592 million charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by American due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela.  

In 2014, nonoperating special items, net principally included a $43 million charge for Venezuelan foreign currency losses, $56 million of early debt extinguishment costs primarily related to the prepayment of 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness and $29 million of non-cash interest accretion on bankruptcy settlement obligations.  

In 2013, nonoperating special items, net consisted of interest charges of $48 million primarily to recognize post-petition interest expense on unsecured obligations pursuant to the Plan and penalty interest related to 10.5% secured notes and 7.50% senior secured notes, a $54 million charge related to the premium on tender for existing EETC financings and the write-off of debt issuance costs and $19 million in charges related to the repayment of existing EETC financings.  

 (5)  In 2013, American recognized reorganization expenses as a result of the filing of voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11. These amounts consisted primarily of estimated allowed claim amounts and professional fees.

 (6)  In 2015, income tax special items totaled a net credit of $3.5 billion. In connection with the preparation of Americans financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2015, management determined that it was more likely than not that substantially all of its deferred tax assets, which include its NOLs, would be realized. Accordingly, American reversed $3.5 billion of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, which resulted in a special $3.5 billion non-cash tax benefit recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for 2015.  

In 2014, income tax special items, net were $344 million. During 2014, American sold its portfolio of fuel hedging contracts that were scheduled to settle on or after June 30, 2014. In connection with this sale, American recorded a special non-cash tax provision of $328 million in the second quarter of 2014 that reversed the non-cash tax provision which was recorded in OCI, a subset of stockholders equity, principally in 2009. This provision represents the tax effect associated with gains recorded in OCI principally in 2009 due to a net increase in the fair value of Americans fuel hedging contracts. In accordance with GAAP, American retained the $328 million tax provision in OCI until the last contract was settled or terminated.  

In 2013, income tax special items, net included a $538 million non-cash income tax benefit from continuing operations. American is required to consider all items (including items recorded in OCI) in determining the amount of tax benefit that results from a loss from continuing operations and that should be allocated to continuing operations. As a result, American recorded a tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations for the year, which was exactly offset by income tax expense on OCI. However, while the income tax benefit from continuing operations is reported on the income statement, the income tax expense on OCI is recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is a component of stockholders equity. Because the income tax expense on OCI is equal to the income tax benefit from continuing operations, Americans year-end net deferred tax position is not impacted by this tax allocation. The 2013 tax benefit was offset in part by a $214 million tax charge attributable to additional valuation allowance required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount American believed was more likely than not to be realized.  

Income Taxes  

At December 31, 2015, American had approximately $8.8 billion of gross NOL Carryforwards to reduce future federal taxable income, substantially all of which are expected to be available for use in 2016. American is a member of AAGs consolidated federal and certain state income tax returns. The amount of federal NOL Carryforwards available in those returns is $8.0 billion, substantially all of which is expected to be available for use in 2016. The federal NOL Carryforwards will expire beginning in 2023 if unused. These NOL Carryforwards include an unrealized tax benefit of $1.2 billion related to share-based compensation that will be recorded in equity when realized. American had approximately $3.7 billion of NOL Carryforwards to reduce future state taxable income at December 31, 2015, which will expire in years 2016 through 2034 if unused. Americans ability to deduct its NOL Carryforwards and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 where an ownership change has occurred. American experienced an ownership change in connection with its emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases, and US Airways Group experienced an ownership change in connection with the Merger. As a result of the Merger, US Airways Group is now included in the AAG consolidated federal and state income tax returns. The general limitation rules of Section 382 for a debtor in a bankruptcy case are liberalized where the ownership change occurs upon emergence from bankruptcy. American elected to be covered by certain special rules for federal income tax purposes that permitted approximately $9.5 billion (with $7.3 billion of unlimited NOL remaining at December 31, 2015) of its federal NOL Carryforwards to be utilized without regard to the Section 382 annual limitation rules unless a second ownership change occurred on or before December 9, 2015. No second ownership change occurred within that period. Substantially all of Americans remaining federal NOL Carryforwards (attributable to US Airways Group) are subject to limitation under Section 382; however, Americans ability to utilize such NOL Carryforwards is not anticipated to be effectively constrained as a result of such limitation. Similar limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. Americans ability to utilize any new NOL Carryforwards arising after the ownership changes is not affected by the annual limitation rules imposed by Section 382 unless another ownership change occurs.  

77  

Table of Contents 

At December 31, 2015, American had an Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) credit carryforward of approximately $458 million available for federal income tax purposes, which is available for an indefinite period.  

In connection with the preparation of Americans financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2015, management determined that it was more likely than not that substantially all of its deferred tax assets, which include its NOLs, would be realized. Accordingly, American reversed $3.5 billion of the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015, which resulted in a special $3.5 billion non-cash tax benefit recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for 2015.  

Beginning in 2016, American expects to record income tax expense with an effective rate of approximately 38%, which will be substantially non-cash as American utilizes the NOLs described above to offset cash income taxes due.  

For the year ended December 31, 2014, American recorded a $320 million tax provision, which included $344 million of special tax charges as described above.  

For the year ended December 31, 2013, American recorded a $354 million tax benefit, which included $324 million of net special tax benefits as described above.

Operating Revenues  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating revenues in 2015 decreased $1.7 billion, or 3.9%, from 2014 principally due to competitive growth and weaker international yields primarily due to foreign currency devaluation relative to the U.S. dollar. Significant changes in the components of operating revenues are as follows:  

       Mainline passenger revenues decreased $1.8 billion, or 5.7%, in 2015 from 2014 driven primarily by a decrease in yield.  

       Regional passenger revenues increased $153 million, or 2.4%, in 2015 from 2014 due primarily to higher ASMs, offset in part by a decrease in yield.  

       Cargo revenue decreased $115 million, or 13.1%, in 2015 from 2014 driven primarily by a decrease in international freight yields.

Operating Expenses  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total operating expenses in 2015 decreased $3.6 billion, or 9.4%, from 2014. Significant changes in the components of mainline operating expenses are as follows:  

       Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased $4.4 billion, or 41.2%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to a 40.7% decrease in the average price per gallon of fuel to $1.72 in 2015 from an average price per gallon of $2.91 in 2014.  

       Salaries, wages and benefits increased $1.0 billion, or 11.9%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increased costs associated with the new, merger related pilot, flight attendant and customer service and reservation agent collective bargaining agreements.  

       Maintenance, materials and repairs decreased $162 million, or 7.9%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to fewer engine overhauls in 2015, driven by Americans fleet renewal program.  

       Selling expenses decreased $150 million, or 9.7%, in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to lower contractually negotiated rates for certain commissions and booking fees as well as lower revenues in 2015.  

Regional Operating Expenses  

Total regional expenses decreased $466 million, or 7.1%, in 2015 to $6.1 billion from $6.6 billion in 2014. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a $779 million, or 38.8%, decrease in fuel costs, offset in part by a $313 million, or 6.9%, increase in other regional operating expenses. The average price per gallon of fuel decreased 40.9% to $1.73 in 2015 from $2.92 in 2014. The increase in other regional operating expenses was principally due to increased flying under capacity purchase agreements.

Other nonoperating expense, net in 2015 included a net $616 million in other nonoperating special charges and $159 million of foreign currency losses. The other nonoperating special charges consisted of a $592 million write off of all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by American due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela and $41 million in charges principally related to non-cash write offs of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs associated with refinancing certain of our secured term loan facilities, prepayments of certain aircraft financings and the purchase and subsequent remarketing of certain special facility revenue bonds. These charges were offset in part by a $17 million early debt extinguishment gain associated with the repayment of Americans AAdvantage loan with Citibank. The foreign currency losses were driven primarily by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies during 2015, principally in Latin American and European markets, including a 34% decrease in the value of the Argentinian peso, a 30% decrease in the value of the Brazilian real, a 14% decrease in the value of the Mexican peso, a 10% decrease in the value of the Euro and a 5% decrease in the value of the British pound.  

Other nonoperating expense, net in 2014 consisted of $114 million of net foreign currency losses, including a $43 million special charge for Venezuelan foreign currency losses, and $56 million in other nonoperating special charges primarily due to early debt extinguishment costs related to the prepayment of our 7.50% senior secured notes and other indebtedness.

As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2013, American recorded reorganization charges to adjust estimated allowed claim amounts previously recorded on rejected special facility revenue bonds of $180 million, allowed general unsecured claims related to the 1990 and 1994 series of special facility revenue bonds that financed certain improvements at JFK, and rejected bonds that financed certain improvements at ORD, which are included in the table above.  

 (4)  The Plan allowed unsecured creditors receiving AAG Series A Preferred Stock a conversion discount of 3.5%. Accordingly, American recorded the fair value of such discount upon the confirmation of the Plan by the Bankruptcy Court.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Cash  

As of December 31, 2015, AAGs total cash, short-term investments and restricted cash and short-term investments was $6.9 billion, of which $695 million was restricted. Additional detail is provided in the table below (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Our restricted cash and short-term investments related primarily to collateral held to support workers compensation obligations.  

As of December 31, 2015, $150 million of our cash and short-term investment balances were held as foreign currency in foreign bank accounts. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recognized a $592 million special charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us, due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela. During 2014, we significantly reduced capacity in the Venezuelan market and we no longer accept bolivars as payment for airline tickets.  

As of December 31, 2014, $804 million of our cash and short-term investment balances were held as foreign currency in foreign bank accounts, of which approximately $656 million was held in Venezuelan bolivars. This balance included approximately $621 million valued at 6.3 bolivars and approximately $35 million valued at 12.0 bolivars, with the rate depending on the date we submitted our repatriation request to the Venezuelan government.  

Generally, fluctuations in foreign currencies, including devaluations, cannot be predicted by us and can significantly affect the value of our cash and short-term investments located outside the United States. These conditions, as well as any further delays, devaluations or imposition of more stringent repatriation restrictions, may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A.

Sources and Uses of Cash  

AAG  

2015 Compared to 2014  

Operating Activities  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $6.2 billion and $3.1 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively, a year-over-year increase of $3.2 billion. The increase was primarily due to increased profitability driven by substantially lower fuel costs. In addition, a decrease in pension contributions from $810 million in 2014 to $6 million in 2015 contributed to increased operating cash flows. Our 2015 profitability was negatively affected by a $592 million charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by us due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela.  

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities was $5.6 billion and $2.9 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

Principal investing activities in 2015 included expenditures of $6.2 billion for property and equipment, consisting primarily of the purchase of 114 newly delivered aircraft and eight spare engines, including 31 Airbus A321 family aircraft, 24 Embraer 175 aircraft, 20 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, 17 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 13 Boeing 787 aircraft, seven Airbus A319 aircraft and two Boeing 777 aircraft and the purchase of five Boeing 757 aircraft previously being leased. These cash outflows were offset in part by $391 million in net sales of short-term investments and a $79 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments primarily due to lower collateral requirements with respect to workers compensation obligations.  

Principal investing activities in 2014 included expenditures of $5.3 billion for property and equipment, consisting primarily of the purchase of 70 newly delivered aircraft, including 25 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 16 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, six Boeing 777 aircraft, and three Airbus A330 family aircraft, the purchase of aircraft previously leased, including nine Airbus A320 family aircraft, three Airbus A330 family aircraft and three Boeing 777 aircraft, as well as pre-delivery deposits for certain aircraft on order. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.8 billion in net sales of short-term investments, $307 million in proceeds from the sale of DCA slots and a $261 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments primarily due to lower collateral requirements with respect to workers compensation obligations.  

Financing Activities  

Net cash used in financing activities was $1.3 billion and $315 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

Principal financing activities in 2015 included share repurchases of $3.6 billion, debt repayments of $2.2 billion, including the $400 million repayment of Americans AAdvantage loan with Citibank, and $278 million in dividend payments. These cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of $5.0 billion of debt primarily including $4.2 billion of EETC equipment notes and other aircraft related financings and $500 million principal amount of 4.625% senior notes.  

Principal financing activities in 2014 included $1.0 billion in stock repurchases and debt repayments of $3.1 billion, including the $1.0 billion prepayment of Americans 7.50% senior secured notes and the $366 million  

85

 prepayment of certain airport facility revenue bonds. These cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of $3.3 billion of debt, primarily including $1.8 billion of proceeds from EETC equipment notes and other aircraft related financings, $1.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% senior notes and the term loan under the 2014 Credit Facilities, as well as $811 million of proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions related to the financing of 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  

2014 Compared to 2013  

Operating Activities  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.1 billion and $675 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, a year-over-year increase of $2.4 billion. This year-over-year increase is principally due to increased profitability and the inclusion of a full year of US Airways Groups net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. These increases were offset in part by higher pension contributions made during 2014. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we contributed $810 million and $494 million, respectively, to fund our defined benefit pension plans, representing a $316 million year-over-year increase in contributions.  

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion and $3.8 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively.  

Principal investing activities in 2014 included expenditures of $5.3 billion for property and equipment, consisting primarily of the purchase of 70 newly delivered aircraft, including 25 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 16 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, six Boeing 777 aircraft, and three Airbus A330 family aircraft, the purchase of aircraft previously leased, including nine Airbus A320 family aircraft, three Airbus A330 family aircraft and three Boeing 777 aircraft, as well as pre-delivery deposits for certain aircraft on order. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.8 billion in net sales of short-term investments, $307 million in proceeds from the sale of DCA slots and a $261 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments primarily due to lower collateral requirements with respect to workers compensation obligations.  

Principal investing activities in 2013 included expenditures of $3.1 billion for property and equipment, consisting primarily of the purchase of 39 newly delivered aircraft, including 31 Boeing 737-800 aircraft and eight Boeing 777 aircraft as well as pre-delivery deposits for certain aircraft on order and $1.2 billion in net purchases of short-term investments. These cash outflows were offset in part by a $147 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments primarily due to lower collateral requirements with respect to workers compensation obligations and $128 million in proceeds from the sale of certain property and equipment. Additionally, in connection with the Merger, we acquired the $206 million cash balance of US Airways Group.  

Financing Activities  

Net cash used in financing activities was $315 million in 2014 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $3.8 billion in 2013.  

Principal financing activities in 2014 included $1.0 billion in stock repurchases and debt repayments of $3.1 billion, including the $1.0 billion prepayment of Americans 7.50% senior secured notes and the $366 million prepayment of certain airport facility revenue bonds. These cash outflows were offset in part by proceeds from the issuance of $3.3 billion of debt, primarily including $1.8 billion of proceeds from EETC equipment notes and other aircraft related financings, $1.5 billion of proceeds from the issuance of the 5.50% senior notes and the term loan under the 2014 Credit Facilities, as well as $811 million of proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions related to the financing of 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.  

86  

Table of Contents 

Principal financing activities in 2013 included proceeds from the issuance of debt of $5.1 billion, including the $1.9 billion 2013 Term Loan Facility and several EETC financings, and proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions of $1.7 billion. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $2.9 billion.  

American  

2015 Compared to 2014  

Operating Activities  

Net cash provided by operating activities was flat at $2.6 billion in each of 2015 and 2014. Cash flows were generated from increased profitability, driven by substantially lower fuel costs and a decrease in pension contributions, which were offset in part by Americans funding of share repurchase activities performed at the AAG parent company level. Americans 2015 profitability was negatively affected by a $592 million charge to write off all of the value of Venezuelan bolivars held by American due to continued lack of repatriations and deterioration of economic conditions in Venezuela.  

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities was $5.6 billion and $2.9 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

These cash outflows were offset in part by $391 million in net sales of short-term investments and a $79 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments primarily due to lower collateral requirements with respect to workers compensation obligations.  

Principal investing activities in 2014 included expenditures of $5.3 billion for property and equipment, consisting primarily of the purchase of 70 newly delivered aircraft, including 25 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 16 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, six Boeing 777 aircraft and three Airbus A330 family aircraft, the purchase of aircraft previously leased, including nine Airbus A320 family aircraft, three Airbus A330 family aircraft and three Boeing 777 aircraft, as well as pre-delivery deposits for certain aircraft on order. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.8 billion in net sales of short-term investments, $307 million in proceeds from the sale of DCA slots and a $261 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments primarily due to lower collateral requirements with respect to workers compensation obligations.  

Financing Activities  

Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.4 billion and $143 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

Principal financing activities in 2015 included proceeds from the issuance of $4.5 billion of debt primarily including $4.2 billion of EETC equipment notes and other aircraft related financings. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $2.2 billion, including the $400 million repayment of Americans AAdvantage loan with Citibank.  

Principal financing activities in 2014 included proceeds from the issuance of $2.6 billion of debt, primarily including $1.8 billion of EETC equipment notes and other aircraft related financings and $750 million of proceeds from issuance of the term loan under the 2014 Credit Facilities, as well as $811 million of proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions related to the financing of 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft. These cash inflows were offset in part by debt repayments of $3.0 billion, including the $1.0 billion prepayment of Americans 7.50% senior secured notes and the $366 million prepayment of certain airport facility revenue bonds.

2014 Compared to 2013  

Operating Activities  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion and $627 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, a year-over-year increase of $2.0 billion. This year-over-year increase is principally due to increased profitability and the inclusion of a full year of US Airways net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. These increases were offset in part by higher pension contributions made during 2014. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, American contributed $809 million and $494 million, respectively, to fund its defined benefit pension plans, representing a $315 million year-over-year increase in contributions.  

Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing activities was $2.9 billion and $3.8 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively.  

Principal investing activities in 2014 included expenditures of $5.3 billion for property and equipment, consisting primarily of the purchase of 70 newly delivered aircraft, including 25 Airbus A320 family aircraft, 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft, 16 Bombardier CRJ900 aircraft, six Boeing 777 aircraft and three Airbus A330 family aircraft, the purchase of aircraft previously leased, including nine Airbus A320 family aircraft, three Airbus A330 family aircraft and three Boeing 777 aircraft, as well as pre-delivery deposits for certain aircraft on order. These cash outflows were offset in part by $1.8 billion in net sales of short-term investments, $307 million in proceeds from the sale of DCA slots and a $261 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments primarily due to lower collateral requirements with respect to workers compensation obligations.

These cash outflows were offset in part by a $147 million decrease in restricted cash and short-term investments primarily due to lower collateral requirements with respect to workers compensation obligations and $115 million in proceeds from the sale of certain property and equipment. Additionally, in connection with the Merger, American acquired the $200 million cash balance of US Airways.  

Financing Activities  

Net cash provided by financing activities was $143 million and $3.9 billion in 2014 and 2013, respectively.  

Principal financing activities in 2014 included proceeds from the issuance of $2.6 billion of debt, primarily including $1.8 billion of EETC equipment notes and other aircraft related financings and $750 million of proceeds from issuance of the term loan under the 2014 Credit Facilities, as well as $811 million of proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions related to the financing of 20 Boeing 737-800 aircraft.

Commitments  

Significant Indebtedness  

As of December 31, 2015, AAG and American had $20.8 billion and $19.1 billion, respectively, in long-term debt and capital leases (including current maturities of $2.2 billion each). See Note 9 and 22 to AAGs

Credit Ratings  

The following table details our credit ratings as of December 31, 2015:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 *  The credit agency does not rate this category for this entity.  

A decrease in our credit ratings could cause our borrowing costs to increase, which would increase our interest expense and could affect our net income, and our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. If our financial performance or industry conditions worsen, we may face future downgrades, which could negatively impact our borrowing costs and the prices of our equity or debt securities. In addition, any downgrade of our credit ratings may indicate a decline in our business and in our ability to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.  

Aircraft and Engine Purchase Commitments  

As of December 31, 2015, we had definitive purchase agreements with Airbus, Boeing and other manufacturers for the acquisition of the following mainline and regional aircraft:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  These aircraft may be operated by wholly-owned subsidiaries or leased to third-party regional carriers which would operate the aircraft under capacity purchase arrangements.  

89  

Table of Contents 

We also have agreements for 49 spare engines to be delivered in 2016 and beyond. Under all of our aircraft and engine purchase agreements, our total future commitments as of December 31, 2015 are expected to be as follows (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  These amounts are net of purchase deposits currently held by the manufacturers and include all commitments for regional aircraft. American has granted Boeing a security interest in its purchase deposits with Boeing. Our purchase deposits held by all manufacturers totaled $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2015.  

In April 2015, we amended our delivery agreement with Boeing to defer four 787 aircraft from 2016 to 2017 and one 787 aircraft from 2017 to 2018. In June 2015, we amended our delivery agreement with Airbus to defer delivery of 10 A320neo family aircraft in 2017 and 25 A320neo family aircraft in 2018 to years 2021 through 2023. In December 2015, we amended our delivery agreement with Airbus to defer two A350 XWB from 2017 to 2020. These deferrals are reflected in the table above.  

As of December 31, 2015, we did not have financing commitments for the following aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered through 2017: 25 Airbus A320 family aircraft in 2016 and 20 Airbus A320 family aircraft in 2017, 8 Boeing 787 family aircraft in 2016 and 13 Boeing 787 family aircraft in 2017, 15 Boeing 737-800 aircraft in 2016, three Boeing 737 MAX family aircraft in 2017 and two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft in 2016. In addition, we do not have financing commitments in place for substantially all aircraft currently on order and scheduled to be delivered in 2018 and beyond. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors  We will need to obtain sufficient financing or other capital to operate successfully.  

Credit Card Processing Agreements  

We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. Credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because, although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to us soon after the purchase is completed, the air travel generally occurs after that time, and the processor may have liability if we do not ultimately provide the air travel or services according to our fare rules. Our agreements allow these processing companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a holdback) equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that company, but for which we have not yet provided the air transportation. We are not currently required to maintain any holdbacks pursuant to these requirements. Certain of our agreements provide that these holdback requirements can be modified at the discretion of the processing companies, up to the estimated liability for future air travel purchased with the respective credit cards, upon the occurrence of specified events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition. The amount that the processing companies may withhold also varies as a result of changes in financial risk due to seasonal fluctuations in ticket volume. Additional holdback requirements will reduce our liquidity in the form of unrestricted cash by the amount of the holdbacks.  

Pension Funding Obligation  

We are required to make minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and various other laws.  

Based on our current funding assumptions, we have no minimum required contributions until 2018. Currently, our minimum funding obligation for our pension plans is subject to temporary favorable rules that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2017. Our pension funding obligations are likely to increase materially following expiration of the temporary funding rules, when we will be required to make contributions relating to the 2018  

90  

Table of Contents 

 fiscal year. The amount of these obligations will depend on the performance of our investments held in trust by the pension plans, interest rates for determining liabilities and our actuarial experience. See Note 13 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 11 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information on retirement benefits as of December 31, 2015.  

Labor Agreements  

In 2014 and 2015, we reached agreements with several labor unions. On December 18, 2014, we reached a JCBA with the APFA. The new agreement did not require ratification and was effective immediately with the wage increases under the JCBA becoming effective January 1, 2015.  

On January 3, 2015, we reached a tentative agreement with the APA on a five-year JCBA, which was ratified on January 30, 2015. The new, higher pay rates were implemented retroactive to December 2, 2014.  

In September 2015, we reached an agreement with the CWA-IBT for a new JCBA applicable to passenger service employees, which was ratified in November 2015 and provided significant pay increases for combined passenger service employees, effective immediately.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements with us.  

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements of the types described in the first three categories above that we believe may have a material current or future effect on financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. Certain guarantees that we do not expect to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations are disclosed in Note 15 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8A and Note 13 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.  

Special Facility Revenue Bonds  

We guarantee the payment of principal and interest of certain special facility revenue bonds issued by municipalities primarily to build or improve airport facilities and purchase equipment which is leased to us. Under such leases, we are required to make rental payments through 2035, sufficient to pay maturing principal and interest payments on the related bonds. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining lease payments guaranteeing the principal and interest on these bonds are $617 million, which are accounted for as operating leases.  

Pass-Through Trusts  

We have financed certain aircraft and engines with pass-through trust certificates, or EETCs, issued by pass-through trusts. These trusts are off-balance sheet entities, the primary purpose of which is to finance our acquisition of flight equipment. Rather than finance each aircraft separately when such aircraft is purchased, delivered or refinanced, these trusts allow American to raise the financing for several aircraft at one time and, if applicable, place such funds in escrow pending a future purchase, delivery or refinancing of the relevant aircraft. The trusts were also structured to provide for certain credit enhancements, such as liquidity facilities to cover certain interest payments, that reduce the risks to the purchasers of the trust certificates and, as a result, reduce the cost of aircraft financing to American.  

91  

Table of Contents 

Each trust covered a set amount of aircraft scheduled to be delivered or refinanced upon the issuance of the EETC or within a specific period of time thereafter. At the time of each covered aircraft financing, the relevant trust used the proceeds of the issuance of the EETC (which may have been available at the time of issuance thereof or held in escrow until the date of delivery of the applicable aircraft) to purchase equipment notes relating to the financed aircraft. The equipment notes were issued, at American or, in the case of equipment notes issued by US Airways prior to its merger with and into American, at US Airways election, in connection with a mortgage financing of the aircraft or, in certain cases, by a separate owner trust in connection with a leveraged lease financing of the aircraft. In the case of a leveraged lease financing, the owner trust then leased the aircraft to American or US Airways. In both cases, the equipment notes are secured by a security interest in the aircraft. On December 30, 2015, American assumed all of US Airways obligations under all outstanding equipment notes previously issued by US Airways. The pass-through trust certificates are not direct obligations of, nor are they guaranteed by, AAG or American. However, in the case of mortgage financings, the equipment notes issued to the trusts are direct obligations of American and, in certain instances, are guaranteed by AAG. As of December 31, 2015, $8.7 billion associated with these mortgage financings is reflected as debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  

With respect to leveraged leases, American evaluated whether the leases had characteristics of a variable interest entity. American concluded the leasing entities met the criteria for variable interest entities. American generally is not the primary beneficiary of the leasing entities if the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease and do not include a residual value guarantee, fixed-price purchase option or similar feature that obligates American to absorb decreases in value or entitles American to participate in increases in the value of the aircraft. American does not provide residual value guarantees to the bondholders or equity participants in the trusts. Some leases have a fair market value or a fixed price purchase option that allows American to purchase the aircraft at or near the end of the lease term. However, the option price approximates an estimate of the aircrafts fair value at the option date. Under this feature, American does not participate in any increases in the value of the aircraft. American concluded it is not the primary beneficiary under these arrangements. Therefore, American accounts for its EETC leveraged lease financings as operating leases. Americans total future obligations under these leveraged lease financings are $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2015.

AAG Contractual Obligations  

The following table provides details of our future cash contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015. The table does not include commitments that are contingent on events or other factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  Amounts represent contractual amounts due. For American, excludes $228 million and for AAG Parent and other AAG subsidiaries, excludes $18 million of unamortized debt discount and debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2015.  

 (2)  For variable-rate debt, future interest obligations are estimated using the current forward rates at December 31, 2015.  

 (3)  Includes $8.7 billion of future principal payments and $2.3 billion of future interest payments, respectively, as of December 31, 2015, related to EETCs associated with mortgage financings for the purchase of certain aircraft.  

 (4)  See Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information about these obligations.  

 (5)  Includes $1.8 billion of future minimum lease payments related to EETC leverage leased financings of certain aircraft as of December 31, 2015.  

 (6)  Represents minimum payments under capacity purchase agreements with third-party regional carriers. These commitments are estimates of costs based on assumed minimum levels of flying under the capacity purchase agreements and our actual payments could differ materially.  

 (7)  Includes minimum pension contributions based on actuarially determined estimates and other postretirement benefit payments based on estimated payments through 2025. See Note 11 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B.  

Capital Raising Activity and Other Possible Actions  

In light of our significant financial commitments related to, among other things, new aircraft and the servicing and amortization of existing debt and equipment leasing arrangements, we and our subsidiaries will regularly  

93  

Table of Contents 

 consider, and enter into negotiations related to, capital raising activity, which may include the entry into leasing transactions and future issuances of secured or unsecured debt obligations or additional equity securities in public or private offerings or otherwise. The cash available from operations and these sources, however, may not be sufficient to cover cash contractual obligations because economic factors may reduce the amount of cash generated by operations or increase costs. For instance, an economic downturn or general global instability caused by military actions, terrorism, disease outbreaks or natural disasters could reduce the demand for air travel, which would reduce the amount of cash generated by operations. An increase in costs, either due to an increase in borrowing costs caused by a reduction in credit ratings or a general increase in interest rates, or due to an increase in the cost of fuel, maintenance, or aircraft, aircraft engines or parts, could decrease the amount of cash available to cover cash contractual obligations. Moreover, the 2013 Credit Facilities, the 2014 Credit Facilities, the 2013 Citicorp Credit Facility and certain of our other financing arrangements contain significant minimum cash balance requirements. As a result, we cannot use all of our available cash to fund operations, capital expenditures and cash obligations without violating these requirements.  

In the past, we have from time to time refinanced, redeemed or repurchased our debt and taken other steps to reduce or otherwise manage the aggregate amount and cost of our debt or lease obligations or otherwise improve our balance sheet. Going forward, depending on market conditions, our cash position and other considerations, we may continue to take such actions.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. See the summary of significant accounting policies included in Note 5 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 5 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional discussion of the application of these estimates and other accounting policies.  

Passenger Revenue  

Passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided. Ticket sales for transportation that has not yet been provided are initially deferred and recorded as air traffic liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates. The balance in the air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity. Our air traffic liability was $3.7 billion and $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

The majority of tickets sold are nonrefundable. A small percentage of tickets, some of which are partially used tickets, expire unused. Due to complex pricing structures, refund and exchange policies, and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized in revenue using estimates regarding both the timing of the  

94  

Table of Contents 

 revenue recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are generally based on the analysis of our historical data. We and other airline industry participants have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel. Estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability are routinely evaluated based on subsequent activity to validate the accuracy of our estimates. Any adjustments resulting from periodic evaluations of the estimated air traffic liability are included in results of operations during the period in which the evaluations are completed.  

Long-lived Assets  

Long-lived assets consist of flight equipment along with other fixed assets and amortizing intangible assets such as certain slots, customer relationships, marketing agreements and tradenames. In addition to the original cost, the recorded value of our fixed assets is impacted by a number of estimates made, including estimated useful lives, salvage values and our determination as to whether aircraft are temporarily or permanently grounded. Amortizing intangible assets are originally recorded at their acquired fair values and are subsequently amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 5 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 5 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for further information.  

We record impairment charges on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. An asset or group of assets is considered impaired when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets and the net book value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair value. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect managements best estimate of future market and operating conditions, including our current fleet plan and considerations of any modifications thereto. Estimates of fair value represent managements best estimate based on appraisals, industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions.  

The majority of Americans fleet types are depreciated over 25-30 years. It is possible that the ultimate lives of our aircraft will be significantly different than the current estimate due to unforeseen events in the future that impact our fleet plan, including positive or negative developments in the areas described above. For example, operating the aircraft for a longer period will result in higher maintenance, fuel and other operating costs than if we replaced the aircraft.  

Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Assets  

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. We have one consolidated reporting unit.  

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill include certain international slots and route authorities and domestic airport slots. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but tested for impairment annually on October 1st or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.  

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are measured for impairment by initially performing a qualitative screen. Under the qualitative approach, we analyze the following factors to determine if events and circumstances have affected the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets: (1) negative trends in our market capitalization, (2) an increase in fuel prices, (3) declining per mile passenger yields, (4) lower passenger demand as a result of a weakened U.S. and global economy and (5) changes to the regulatory environment.  

If we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset value may be impaired, we use the quantitative approach to assess the assets fair value and the amount of the impairment. Under the quantitative approach, we  

95  

Table of Contents 

 calculate the fair value of the asset using the following assumptions: (1) our projected revenues, expenses and cash flows, (2) an estimated weighted average cost of capital, (3) assumed discount rates depending on the asset (4) a tax rate and (5) market prices for comparable assets. These assumptions are consistent with those which hypothetical market participants would use. If the assets carrying value exceeds its fair value calculated using the quantitative approach, we will record an impairment charge for the difference in fair value and carrying value.  

Based upon our annual testing, there were no impairments of our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets in 2015.  

Business Combination Measurements  

In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we estimated the fair value of US Airways assets and liabilities as of the closing date of the Merger, December 9, 2013. These fair value adjustments did not result in gains or losses, but were instead an input to the calculation of goodwill related to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed by us in the Merger.  

The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market, income and cost approaches. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, other than certain long-term debt assumed in the Merger. The market approach, which indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets, was utilized to estimate the fair value of US Airways aircraft and operating leases. The market approach used included prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable assets, as well as pricing guides and other sources. We considered the current market for the aircraft, the maintenance condition of the aircraft and the expected proceeds from the sale of the assets, among other factors. We also utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport take off and landing slots when sufficient market information was available. The income approach was primarily used to value intangible assets, including customer relationships, marketing agreements, certain international route authorities, and the US Airways tradename. The income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for certain assets for which the market and income approaches could not be applied due to the nature of the asset. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the asset, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation. The fair value of the US Airways Dividend Miles loyalty program liability was determined based on the weighted average equivalent ticket value of outstanding miles which were expected to be redeemed for future travel at December 9, 2013. The weighted average equivalent ticket value contemplates differing classes of service, domestic and international itineraries and the carrier providing the award travel.  

Loyalty Program  

We currently operate the loyalty program, AAdvantage. This program awards mileage credits to passengers who fly on American and oneworld carriers, as well as certain other partner airlines that participate in the program. Mileage credits can also be earned through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in our loyalty program. Mileage credits can be redeemed for travel on American or other participating partner airlines, in which case we pay a fee.  

We use the incremental cost method to account for the portion of our loyalty program liability incurred when AAdvantage members earn mileage credits by flying on American or our regional affiliates. We have an obligation to provide future travel when these mileage credits are redeemed and therefore have recorded a liability for mileage credits outstanding.  

96  

Table of Contents 

The incremental cost liability includes all mileage credits that are expected to be redeemed, including mileage credits earned by members whose mileage account balances have not yet reached the minimum mileage credit level required to redeem an award. Additionally, outstanding mileage credits are subject to expiration if unused. In calculating the liability, we estimate how many mileage credits will never be redeemed for travel and exclude those mileage credits from the estimate of the liability. Estimates are also made for the number of miles that will be used per award redemption and the number of travel awards that will be redeemed on partner airlines. These estimates are based on historical program experience as well as consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable. Changes in the liability resulting from members earning additional mileage credits or changes in estimates are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a part of passenger revenue.  

The liability for outstanding mileage credits is valued based on the estimated incremental cost of carrying one additional passenger. Incremental cost primarily includes unit costs incurred for fuel, food, and insurance as well as fees incurred when travel awards are redeemed on partner airlines. No profit or overhead margin is included in the accrual of incremental cost. These estimates are generally updated based upon our 12-month historical average of such costs.  

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the liability for outstanding mileage credits for the AAdvantage program accounted for under the incremental cost method was $657 million and $674 million, respectively, and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within loyalty program liability.  

In addition, we applied the acquisition method of accounting in connection with the Merger and therefore recorded the liability for outstanding US Airways mileage credits at fair value, an amount significantly in excess of incremental cost. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the liability for these outstanding mileage credits expected to be redeemed for future travel awards was $296 million and $611 million, respectively, and is included on the consolidated balance sheets within loyalty program liability. This liability is amortized into passenger revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the mileage credits are expected to be redeemed for travel. All new miles earned will be recorded as a liability based on the incremental cost method discussed above.  

American also sells loyalty program mileage credits to participating airline partners and non-airline business partners. Sales of mileage credits to non-airline business partners is comprised of two components, transportation and marketing. Historically, we have used the residual method of accounting to determine the values of each component as there had not been a material modification to any significant agreements since the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)  Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements on January 1, 2011.  

In 2013, American and Citibank amended their AAdvantage co-branded credit card agreement, which resulted in a material modification of the terms of the arrangement. Also, in connection with the acquisition of US Airways on December 9, 2013, a material modification occurred on all of US Airways agreements in connection with the Merger. Therefore, subsequent to the amendments of these arrangements, we have applied the relative selling price method to determine the values of each deliverable. Under the relative selling price approach, we identified five revenue elements for the co-branded credit card agreements with Citibank and Barclays: the transportation component; use of the American brand including access to loyalty program member lists; advertising; lounge access; and baggage services (together excluding the transportation component, the marketing component).  

The transportation component represents the estimated selling price of future travel awards and is determined using historical transaction information, including information related to customer redemption patterns. The transportation component is deferred based on its relative selling price and is amortized into passenger revenue on a straight-line basis over the period in which the mileage credits are expected to be redeemed for travel.  

The marketing component represents services provided to our business partners and relates primarily to the use of the American brand including access to loyalty program member lists. The marketing services are provided  

97

 periodically, but no less than monthly. Accordingly, the marketing component is considered earned and recognized in other revenues in the period of the mileage sale.  

Upon application of the relative selling price method in 2013 for Americans Citibank modification, we reduced our travel component liability and recorded other revenue of approximately $31 million. As a result of the change in the marketing component value when the relative selling price method is applied, we now defer less revenue per mile sold.  

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, American had $1.5 billion in deferred revenue from the sale of mileage credits (recorded within loyalty program liability on the consolidated balance sheets). For the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the marketing component of mileage sales recognized at the time of sale in other revenues was approximately $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion and $834 million, respectively.  

A change to certain estimates used in the calculation of incremental cost could have a material impact on the liability. A one percentage point increase or decrease in the percentage of travel awards redeemed on partner airlines would have an approximate $35 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2015. A 10% increase or decrease in the assumed price per gallon of fuel would have an approximate $12 million impact on the liability as of December 31, 2015.  

A change to the estimated fair value of the transportation component could have a significant impact on revenue. A 10% increase or decrease in the estimated fair value of the transportation component would have an approximately $75 million impact on revenue recognized in 2015.  

The number of one way travel award redemptions during the year ended December 31, 2015, was 8.3 million representing 6.5% of our total mainline and regional RPMs during that period. We believe displacement of revenue passengers is minimal given our load factors and our ability to manage loyalty program seat inventory.  

Pensions and Retiree Medical and Other Postretirement Benefits  

We recognize the funded status (i.e., the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of our pension and other postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  

Our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. We use certain assumptions including, but not limited to, the selection of the: (i) discount rate; (ii) expected return on plan assets; (iii) expected health care cost trend rate and (iv) the estimated age of pilot retirement (as discussed below). These assumptions as of December 31 were:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  When establishing our discount rate to measure our obligations, we match high quality corporate bonds available in the marketplace whose cash flows approximate our projected benefit disbursements. Lowering  

98  

Table of Contents 

     the discount rate by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2015 would increase our pension and other postretirement benefits obligations by approximately $1.2 billion and $52 million, respectively, and increase estimated 2016 pension expense by $7 million and decrease estimated 2016 other postretirement benefit expense by less than $1 million.  

 (2)  The expected return on plan assets is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions and our target asset allocation of 31% longer duration corporate and U.S. government/agency bonds, 32% U.S. value stocks, 19% developed international stocks, 10% emerging markets stocks and bonds and 8% alternative (private) investments. The expected return on plan assets component of our net periodic benefit cost is calculated based on the fair value of plan assets and our target asset allocation. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 50 basis points as of December 31, 2015 would increase estimated 2016 pension expense and other postretirement benefit expense by approximately $47 million and $1 million, respectively.  

 (3)  The health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions. Increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 100 basis points would increase estimated 2016 other postretirement benefits expense by $3 million.  

During 2015, we revised our mortality assumptions to incorporate the new mortality improvement scale issued by the Society of Actuaries. This resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our pension and retiree medical programs of $161 million and $9 million, respectively. We also reviewed and revised certain other economic and demographic assumptions including the pension and retiree medical discount rates and health care cost and trend rates. The net effect of changing these assumptions for the pension and retiree medical plans resulted in a decrease of $940 million and $119 million, respectively, in the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2015 primarily due to the increase in the pension discount rate.  

See Note 13 to AAGs Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8A and Note 11 to Americans Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8B for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.  

Income Taxes  

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established, if necessary, for the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence, are not expected to be realized.
