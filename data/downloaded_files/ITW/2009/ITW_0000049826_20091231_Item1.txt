 80/20 Business Process  

 A key element of the Companys business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Companys operations use this 80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Companys 840 operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:  

       Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last resort, eliminating low-value products.   

       Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.   

       Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.   

       Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.     

 3   
 The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results.  

 Discontinued Operations  

 In August 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Click Commerce industrial software business which was previously reported in the All Other segment. In the second quarter of 2009, the Company completed the sale of the Click Commerce business.  

 In 2006, the Company divested a construction business. In 2007, the Company divested an automotive machinery business and a consumer packaging business. In the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company classified an automotive components business and a second consumer packaging business as held for sale. The second consumer packaging business was sold in 2008. The Company completed the divestiture of the automotive components business in 2009.  

 Additionally, in August 2008, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the divestiture of the Decorative Surfaces segment which was subsequently classified as a discontinued operation. In May 2009, the Companys Board of Directors rescinded its earlier resolution to divest the Decorative Surfaces segment and, accordingly, all periods presented have been restated to present the Decorative Surfaces segment as a continuing operation.

 Competition  

 With approximately 840 business units operating in 57 countries, the Company has a wide diversity of products in a myriad of markets, many of which are fragmented, and we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line, end market and geographic area. Our competitors include many regional or specialized companies, as well as large U.S. and non-U.S. companies or divisions of large companies. Each of our segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and geographic areas. In addition, our Decorative Surfaces and Power Systems & Electronics segments each has one global competitor and numerous smaller regional competitors.  

 In virtually all segments, we compete on the basis of product innovation, product quality, brand preference, delivery service and price. Technical capability is also a competitive factor in most of our segments. We believe that for each of our segments, our primary competitive advantages derive from our decentralized operating structure, which creates a strong focus on end markets and customers at the local level, enabling our businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics. This structure enables our business units to drive operational excellence utilizing our 80/20 business process and leverages our product innovation capabilities. We also believe that our global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of our markets, especially in our Transportation and Decorative Surfaces segments.  

 Raw Materials  

 The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily steel, resins, chemicals and paper, that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are currently anticipated.  

 Research and Development  

 The Companys growth has resulted from developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods, processes and equipment, and from acquisitions. Many new products are designed to reduce customers costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly, or by    

 5   
 improving the quality of customers assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Research and development expenses were $198,536,000 in 2009, $212,658,000 in 2008 and $197,595,000 in 2007.  

 The Company owns approximately 3,800 unexpired United States patents covering articles, methods and machines. Many counterparts of these patents have also been obtained in various foreign countries. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,700 applications for patents pending in the United States Patent Office, but there is no assurance that any patent will be issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for the administration of patents and processing of patent applications.  

 The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important. Nevertheless, the Company credits its leadership in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers. The expiration of any one of the Companys patents would not have a material effect on the Companys results of operations or financial position.  

 Trademarks  

 Many of the Companys products are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company. Among the most significant are: ITW, Acme, Alpine, Anaerobicos, Angleboard, Apex, Arborite, Ark-Les, Avery Berkel, Avery Weigh-Tronix, Bernard, Betaprint, Binks, Buehler, Buildex, Bycotest, Chemtronics, Covid, Cullen, Deltar, Densit, Devcon, DeVilbiss, Dymon, Dynatec, Dynatruss, Electrocal, Euromere, Evercoat, E-Z Anchor, Fastex, Filtertek, Foilmark, Forte, Foster, Franklynn, Futura Coatings, Gamko, Gema, GSE, Gymcol, Hartness, Hi-Cone, Hobart, Instron, Intellibuild, Keps, Kester, Krafft, Lachenmeier, Lebo, Loma, LPS, Luvex, Magna, Magnaflux, Meyercord, Miller, Mima, Minigrip, Nexus, NorDen, Nylex, Orbitalum, Orgapack, Pacific Polymers, Paktron, Paslode, Peerless, Permatex, Plexus, Polymark, Polyrey, Pro/Mark, Pryda, QMI, QSA, Quipp, Racor, Ramset, Ransburg, Red Head, Resopal, Reyflex, Riderite, Rippey, Rockwell, Rocol, Sentinel, Shakeproof, Shore, Signode, Simco, Solplas, Sonotech, Space Bag, Spectrum, Speedline, Spiroid, SPIT, Spray Nine, Stero, Stokvis, Strapex, Tapcon, Teks, Tempil, Tenax, Texwipe, Traulsen, Tregaskiss, Truswal Systems, Trymer, Valeron, Versachem, Vitronics Soltec, Vulcan, Wachs, WERCS, Wilsonart, Wynns and Zip-Pak.  

 Environmental  

 The Company believes that its plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Companys capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.  

 Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes and the sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Companys revenues or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts to develop and sell environmentally compatible products.  

 Employees  

 The Company employed approximately 59,000 persons as of December 31, 2009 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.  

 International  

 The Companys international operations include subsidiaries and joint ventures in 56 foreign countries on six continents. These operations serve such end markets as construction, general industrial, automotive, food institutional/restaurant and service, food and beverage, electronics, consumer durables, primary metals, and others on a worldwide basis. The Companys revenues from sales to customers outside the United States were approximately 57% of revenues in 2009, 58% of revenues in 2008 and 55% of revenues in 2007.
