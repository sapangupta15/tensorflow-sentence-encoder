ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Set forth below is a summary of the material risks to an investment in our securities. These risks are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. If any of the below risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which might cause the value of our securities to decline.

We face risks associated with significant international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.

We operate on a global basis with approximately 80% of our Net sales originating in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce our exposure to risks in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:

▪changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets,

▪exchange controls and other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseas,

▪political or economic instability, social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets,

▪lack of well-established or reliable legal systems in certain countries where we operate,

▪foreign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources, and

▪other foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or the imposition of onerous trade restrictions, price controls, profit controls or other government controls.

These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 

In an effort to minimize the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we engage in a combination of cost-containment measures, sourcing strategies, selling price increases and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions. However, these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations.

For example, we have been and will continue to be impacted by developments in Venezuela including the significant devaluations of the Venezuelan bolivar fuerte that occurred in 2010 and in February 2013 and the announcements made in late January 2014. On April 1, 2012, price controls became effective in Venezuela affecting most products in our Venezuelan subsidiary’s (“CP Venezuela”) portfolio, thereby further restricting our ability to implement price increases, which had been one of the key mechanisms to offset the effects of continuing high inflation and the impact of currency devaluation. In addition, at 

 4

times, production at CP Venezuela has been negatively impacted by labor issues within the country. Going forward, additional government actions, including in the form of further currency devaluations or continued or worsening import authorization controls, foreign exchange, price or profit controls or expropriation or other form of government take-over could have further adverse impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as could additional labor unrest in Venezuela. For additional information regarding these and other risks associated with our operations in Venezuela, refer to Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Overview and Outlook” and Note 14, Venezuela to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Significant competition in our industry could adversely affect our business.

We face vigorous competition worldwide, including from local competitors and other large, multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do. We face this competition in several aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, the pricing of products, promotional activities, new product introductions and expansion into new geographies. Such competition also extends to administrative and legal challenges of product claims and advertising. Our ability to compete also depends on the strength of our brands and on our ability to defend our patent, trademark and trade dress rights against legal challenges brought by competitors.

We may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of such initiatives or challenges by competitors or to successfully counteract them, which could harm our business. In addition, the cost of responding to such initiatives and challenges, including management time, out-of-pocket expenses and price reductions, may affect our performance in the relevant period. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Our business is subject to legal and regulatory risks in the U.S. and abroad.

Our business is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements in the U.S. and abroad. Such legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising and sale. U.S. federal authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas. Also, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the U.S. and abroad.

Because of our extensive international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, joint-venture partners or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 

In addition, new or more stringent legal or regulatory requirements, or more restrictive interpretations of existing requirements, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For example, from time to time, various regulatory authorities and consumer groups in Europe, the U.S. and other countries request or conduct reviews of the use of various ingredients in consumer products. Triclosan, an ingredient used by us primarily in Colgate Total toothpaste as well as certain other oral care products and soaps, is an example of an ingredient that has undergone reviews by various regulatory authorities worldwide. Triclosan is currently being evaluated under the European Union’s Regulation for the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, which requires the registration of all chemicals used in the European Union by 2018. In the U.S., the FDA is evaluating the use of triclosan and benzalkoniam chloride (an ingredient used in certain of our hand soap products) in hand soaps and hand sanitizers. In addition, potential legislation seeking to ban the sale of consumer products containing triclosan has been proposed by legislators in Chicago, Illinois and in Minnesota. A decision by a regulatory or governmental authority that triclosan, or any other of our ingredients, should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly regulated, could adversely impact our business, as could negative reactions by our consumers, trade customers or non-governmental organizations to our use of such ingredients. Additionally, an inability to develop new or reformulated products containing alternative ingredients or to obtain regulatory approval of such products on a timely basis could likewise adversely affect our business.

While it is our policy and practice to comply with all legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, a finding that we are in violation of, or out of compliance with, applicable laws or regulations could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, damages, injunctions or product recalls, or criminal sanctions, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if a claim is unsuccessful, is without merit or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products, processes or business practices could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. For information regarding our legal and regulatory matters, see Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” and Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Uncertain global economic conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business.

Uncertain global economic conditions could adversely affect our business. Recent global economic trends pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues, profitability and cash flows. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands, during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may switch to economy brands, which could reduce sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. Additionally, retailers may increase pressure on our selling prices or increase promotional activity for lower-priced or value offerings as they seek to maintain sales volumes and margins.

While we currently generate significant cash flows from ongoing operations and have access to global credit markets through our various financing activities, any disruption in the credit markets could limit the availability of credit or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend credit, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. If any financial institutions that hold our cash or other investments or that are parties to our revolving credit facility supporting our commercial paper program or other financing arrangements, such as interest rate or foreign exchange hedging instruments, were to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent, they may be unable to perform under their agreements with us. This could leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or unhedged against certain interest rate or foreign currency exposures. In addition, tighter credit markets may lead to business disruptions for certain of our suppliers, contract manufacturers or trade customers which could, in turn, adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Increasing dependence on key retailers in developed markets, changes in the policies of our retail trade customers and the emergence of new sales channels may adversely affect our business.

Our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased trade concentration and the growing presence of large-format retailers and discounters. With the growing trend toward retail trade consolidation, we are increasingly dependent on key retailers, and some of these retailers, including large-format retailers, may have greater bargaining strength than we do. They may use this leverage to demand higher trade discounts, allowances or slotting fees, which could lead to reduced sales or profitability. 

We may also be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers, such as inventory de-stocking, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products, environmental or sustainability initiatives and other conditions. For example, a determination by a key retailer that any of our ingredients should not be used in certain consumer products or should otherwise be newly restricted could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. In addition, private label products sold by retail trade chains, which are typically sold at lower prices than branded products, are a source of competition for certain of our product lines, including liquid hand soaps and shower gels. The emergence of new sales channels, such as sales via e-commerce, may affect consumer preferences and market dynamics and could also adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. 

The growth of our business depends on the successful development and launch of innovative new products.

Our growth depends on the continued success of existing products as well as the successful development and launch of innovative new products and line extensions. The development and introduction of innovative new products and line extensions involve considerable costs, and any new product or line extension may not generate sufficient customer and consumer interest and sales to become a profitable product or to cover the costs of its development and promotion. Our ability to achieve a successful launch of a new product or line extension could be adversely affected by preemptive actions taken by competitors in response to the launch, such as increased promotional activities and advertising. In addition, our ability to create new products and line extensions and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can successfully:

▪develop and fund technological innovations,

 6

▪obtain and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection and avoid infringing intellectual property rights of others,

▪obtain approvals and registrations of regulated products, including from the FDA and other regulatory bodies in the U.S. and abroad, and

▪anticipate and respond to consumer needs and preferences.

The failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business and any delay in the development or launch of a new product could result in us not being the first to market, which could compromise our competitive position and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

We may not realize the benefits that we expect from our 2012 Restructuring Program.

In the fourth quarter of 2012, we commenced a four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program (the “2012 Restructuring Program”) for sustained growth. The 2012 Restructuring Program’s initiatives are expected to help us ensure continued and solid worldwide growth in unit volume, organic sales and earnings per share and enhance our global leadership positions in our core businesses. 

The successful implementation of the 2012 Restructuring Program presents significant organizational challenges and in many cases will require successful negotiations with third parties, including labor organizations, suppliers and other business partners. As a result, we may not be able to realize all of the anticipated benefits from our 2012 Restructuring Program. Events and circumstances, such as financial or strategic difficulties, delays and unexpected costs may occur that could result in our not realizing all of the anticipated benefits or our not realizing the anticipated benefits on our expected timetable. If we are unable to realize the anticipated savings of the 2012 Restructuring Program, our ability to fund other initiatives may be adversely affected. Any failure to implement the 2012 Restructuring Program in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Volatility in material and other costs and our increasing dependence on key suppliers could adversely impact our profitability.

Raw and packaging material commodities such as resins, pulp, essential oils, tropical oils, poultry, corn, soybeans and tallow are subject to wide price variations. Increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy, transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution. In addition, our move to global suppliers for materials and other services in order to achieve cost reductions and simplify our business has resulted in an increasing dependence on key suppliers. For certain key materials, including triclosan, we use single-source suppliers. In addition, for certain materials, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time. While we believe that the supplies of raw materials needed to manufacture our products are adequate, global economic conditions, supplier capacity constraints, climatic events such as droughts or hurricanes and other factors could affect the availability of, or prices for, those raw materials, and an interruption in their supply could adversely affect our business, results of operation, cash flows and financial condition. 

Damage to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business.

Maintaining our strong reputation with consumers and our trade partners globally is critical to selling our branded products. Accordingly, we devote significant time and resources to programs designed to protect and preserve our reputation, such as our Ethics and Compliance, Sustainability, Brand Protection and Product Safety, Regulatory and Quality initiatives. 

In addition, third parties sell counterfeit versions of our products, which are inferior or may pose safety risks. As a result, consumers of our brands could confuse our products with these counterfeit products, which could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

Similarly, adverse publicity about us or our brands regarding health concerns, legal or regulatory proceedings, environmental impacts, including packaging, energy and water use and waste management, or other sustainability issues, whether or not deserved, could jeopardize our reputation. In addition, negative posts or comments about us on any social media web site could harm our reputation. Damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these 

 7

reasons could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, as well as require resources to rebuild our reputation.

Our business is subject to product liability and false marketing claims.

From time to time we may be subject to product liability claims alleging, among other things, that our products cause damage to property or persons, provide inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or contain design or manufacturing defects or contaminants. In addition, from time to time we may be subject to claims from competitors and consumers, including consumer class actions, alleging that our product claims are deceptive. Regardless of their merit, these claims can require significant time and expense to investigate and defend. For example, as described in Item 3 “Legal Proceedings,” we have been named in product liability actions alleging that certain talc products we sold prior to 1996 were contaminated with asbestos, causing harm to consumers. In addition, if one of our products, or a raw material contained in our products, is perceived or found to be defective or unsafe, we may need to recall some of our products. Whether or not a product liability or false marketing claim is successful, or a recall is required, such assertions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and the negative publicity surrounding them could harm our reputation and brand image.

Our business is subject to the risks inherent in global manufacturing and sourcing activities.

We are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale. We are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to:

▪industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues,

▪environmental events, 

▪strikes and other labor disputes,

▪disruptions in logistics, 

▪loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, 

▪raw material and product quality or safety issues, 

▪the impact on our suppliers of tighter credit or capital markets, and 

▪natural disasters, including climatic events and earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism and other external factors over which we have no control.

While we have business continuity and contingency plans in place for key manufacturing sites and the supply of raw materials, significant disruption of manufacturing for any of the above reasons could interrupt product supply and, if not remedied, have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.

A failure of a key information technology system could adversely impact our ability to conduct business.

We rely extensively on information technology systems, including some which rely on third-party service providers, in order to conduct our business. These systems include, but are not limited to:

▪communicating within the Company and with other parties,

▪ordering and managing materials from suppliers,

▪converting materials to finished products,

▪receiving and processing orders from and shipping products to our customers,

▪marketing products to consumers, 

 8

▪collecting and storing customer, consumer, employee, investor and other stakeholder information and personal data,

▪processing transactions,

▪summarizing and reporting results of operations, 

▪complying with legal, regulatory or tax requirements, and 

▪other processes involved in managing the business.

Although we have network security measures in place, the systems may be vulnerable to computer viruses, security breaches and other similar disruptions from unauthorized users. While we have business continuity plans in place, if the systems are damaged or cease to function properly for any reason, including the poor performance or failure of third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, network outages, failed upgrades or other similar events, and if the business continuity plans do not effectively resolve such issues on a timely basis, we may suffer interruptions in our ability to manage or conduct business as well as reputational harm, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Furthermore, if we suffer a loss or disclosure of confidential business or stakeholder information as a result of a breach of our information technology systems or failure of third-party service providers, we may suffer reputational, competitive, and/or business harm, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations cash flows and financial condition.

Our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain key employees and the succession of senior management.

Our success largely depends on the performance of our management team and other key employees. If we are unable to attract and retain talented, highly qualified senior management and other key people, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to effectively provide for the succession of senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. While we follow a disciplined, ongoing succession planning process and have succession plans in place for senior management and other key executives, these do not guarantee that the services of qualified senior executives will continue to be available to us at particular moments in time.
