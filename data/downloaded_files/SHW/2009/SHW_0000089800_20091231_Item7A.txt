ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

 We are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates, foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. We occasionally utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk management policy, but do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company entered into foreign currency option and forward currency exchange contracts and commodity swaps during 2009 to hedge against value changes in foreign currency and commodities. There were no contracts outstanding at December 31, 2009. Foreign currency option and forward contracts are described in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 72 of our 2009 Annual Report. Commodity swaps are described in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 45 of our 2009 Annual Report. We believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency and commodity price fluctuations. However, we do not expect currency translation, transaction, commodity price fluctuations or hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
