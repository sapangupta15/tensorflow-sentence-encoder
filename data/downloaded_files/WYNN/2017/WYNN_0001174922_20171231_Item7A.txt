Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

In the normal course of business, our financial position is subject to market risk, including, but not limited to, potential losses due to changes in the value of financial instruments including those resulting from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market valuation.

Interest Rate Risks

One of our primary exposures to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our debt facilities that bear interest based on floating rates. We attempt to manage interest rate risk by managing the mix of long-term fixed rate borrowings and variable rate borrowings, supplemented by hedging activities as believed by us to be appropriate. We cannot assure you that these risk management strategies have had the desired effect, and interest rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 

The following table provides estimated future cash flow information derived from our best estimates of repayments as of December 31, 2017, of our expected long-term indebtedness and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. However, we cannot predict the LIBOR or HIBOR rates that will be in effect in the future. Actual rates will vary. The one-month LIBOR and HIBOR rates as of December 31, 2017 of 1.57% and 1.19%, respectively, were used for all variable rate calculations in the table below.

Interest Rate Sensitivity

As of December 31, 2017, approximately 66.3% of the principal amount of our long-term debt was based on fixed rates. Based on our borrowings as of December 31, 2017, an assumed 100 basis point change in the variable rates would cause our annual interest cost to change by $33.0 million.

Foreign Currency Risks

The currency delineated in Wynn Macau SA's concession agreement with the government of Macau is the Macau pataca. The Macau pataca, which is not a freely convertible currency, is linked to the Hong Kong dollar, and in many cases the two are used interchangeably in Macau. The Hong Kong dollar is linked to the U.S. dollar and the exchange rate between these two currencies has remained relatively stable over the past several years. However, the exchange linkages of the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca, and the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S. dollar, are subject to potential changes due to, among other things, changes in Chinese governmental policies and international economic and political developments.

If the Hong Kong dollar and the Macau pataca are not linked to the U.S. dollar in the future, severe fluctuations in the exchange rate for these currencies may result. We also cannot assure you that the current rate of exchange fixed by the applicable monetary authorities for these currencies will remain at the same level.

We expect most of the revenues and expenses for any casino that we operate in Macau will be in Hong Kong dollars or Macau patacas. For any U.S. dollar-denominated debt or other obligations incurred by our Macau-related entities, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Macau pataca or the Hong Kong dollar, in relation to the U.S. dollar, could have adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to service debt. Based on our balances as of December 31, 2017, an assumed 1% change in the US dollar/Hong Kong dollar exchange rate would cause a foreign currency transaction gain/loss of $25.2 million.
