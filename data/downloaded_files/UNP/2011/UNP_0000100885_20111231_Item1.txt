OPERATIONS  

The Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although revenue is analyzed by commodity group, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network. Additional information regarding our business and operations, including revenue and financial information and data and other information regarding environmental matters, is presented in Risk Factors, Item 1A; Legal Proceedings, Item 3; Selected Financial Data, Item 6; Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7; and the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 (which include information regarding revenues, statements of income, and total assets).

  Operations  UPRR is a Class I railroad operating in the U.S. We have 31,898 route miles, linking Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and eastern U.S. gateways and providing several corridors to key Mexican gateways. We serve the western two-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers to move freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic moves through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders. Our freight traffic consists of bulk, manifest, and premium business. Bulk traffic is primarily coal, grain, rock, or soda ash in unit trains  trains transporting a single commodity from one source to one destination. Manifest traffic is individual carload or less than train-load business, including commodities such as lumber, steel, paper, food    

2011 Freight Revenue 

  and chemicals. The transportation of finished vehicles, intermodal containers and truck trailers is part of our premium business. In 2011, we generated freight revenues totaling $18.5 billion from the following six commodity groups:  

Agricultural  Transportation of grains, commodities produced from these grains, and food and beverage products generated 18% of the Railroads 2011 freight revenue. The Company accesses most major grain markets, linking the Midwest and western producing areas to export terminals in the Pacific Northwest and Gulf Coast ports, as well as Mexico. We also serve significant domestic markets, including grain processors, animal feeders and ethanol producers in the Midwest, West, South and Rocky Mountain states. Unit trains, which transport a single commodity between producers and export terminals or domestic markets, represent nearly 40% of agricultural shipments.  

Automotive  We are the largest automotive carrier west of the Mississippi River and operate or access over 40 vehicle distribution centers. The Railroads extensive franchise serves vehicle assembly plants and connects to West Coast ports and the Port of Houston to accommodate both import and export shipments. In addition to transporting finished vehicles, UP provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for Mexico, the U.S. and Canada. The automotive group generated 8% of Union Pacifics freight revenue in 2011. Finished vehicles accounted for 78% of this revenue, with transportation of automotive parts and materials providing the remaining 22%.  

Chemicals  Transporting chemicals generated 15% of our freight revenue in 2011. The Railroads unique franchise serves the chemical producing areas along the Gulf Coast, where roughly two-thirds of the Companys chemical business originates, terminates or travels. Our chemical franchise also accesses chemical producers in the Rocky Mountains and on the West Coast. The Companys chemical shipments include three broad categories: Petrochemicals, Fertilizer and Soda Ash. Petrochemicals include industrial chemicals, plastics, petroleum products, including crude oil from North Dakota, and liquid petroleum gases. These products move primarily to and from the Gulf Coast region. Fertilizer movements originate in the Gulf Coast region, the western part of the U.S. and Canada for delivery to major agricultural users in the Midwest, western U.S. and abroad. Soda ash originates in southwestern Wyoming and California, destined for chemical and glass producing markets in North America and abroad.  

Energy  Coal and petroleum coke transportation accounted for the largest share of our freight revenue, 22% in 2011. The Railroads network supports the transportation of coal and petroleum coke to utilities and industrial facilities throughout the U.S. Through interchange gateways and ports, UPs reach extends to eastern U.S. utilities, Mexico, Europe and Asia. Water terminals allow the Railroad to move western U.S. coal east via the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, as well as the Great Lakes. Export coal moves through West Coast ports to Asia and through Mississippi River and Gulf Coast terminals to Europe. Coal traffic originating in the Southern Powder River Basin (SPRB) area of Wyoming is the largest segment of UPs energy business.

Industrial Products  Our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout North America. The Industrial Products commodity group consists of several categories, including construction products, metals, minerals, paper, consumer goods, lumber and other miscellaneous products. In 2011, this group generated 17% of Union Pacifics total freight revenue. Commercial and highway construction drives shipments of steel and construction products, consisting of rock, cement and roofing materials. Industrial manufacturing plants receive nonferrous metals and industrial minerals. Paper and consumer goods, including furniture and appliances, move to major metropolitan areas for consumers. Lumber shipments originate primarily in the pacific northwest and Canada and move throughout the U.S. for use in new home construction and repair and remodeling.  

Intermodal  Our Intermodal business includes two shipment categories: international and domestic. International business consists of imported and exported container traffic that mainly passes through West Coast ports served by UPs extensive terminal network. Domestic business includes container and trailer traffic picked up and delivered within North America for intermodal marketing companies (primarily shipper agents and logistics companies), as well as truckload carriers. Less-than-truckload and package carriers with time-sensitive business requirements are also an important part of these domestic shipments. Together, international and domestic business generated 20% of UPs 2011 freight revenue.  

Seasonality  Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity, such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons, and the demand cycle for the commodity, such as intermodal traffic, which generally has a peak shipping season during the third quarter to meet holiday-related demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter. The peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably from year to year depending upon various factors, including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies and the strength of harvests and market prices for agricultural products. In response to an annual request delivered by the Surface Transportation Board (STB) of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to all of the Class I railroads operating in the U.S., we issue a publicly available letter during the third quarter detailing our plans for handling traffic during the third and fourth quarters and providing other information requested by the STB.  

Working Capital  At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had a working capital surplus. This reflects a strong cash position, which provides enhanced liquidity in an uncertain economic environment. In addition, we believe we have adequate access to capital markets to meet cash requirements, and we have sufficient financial capacity to satisfy our current liabilities.  

Competition  We are subject to competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ship and barge operators, and pipelines. Our main rail competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. Its rail subsidiary, BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers. Motor carrier competition exists for five of our six commodity groups (excluding energy). Because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and Gulf Coast waterways, barges can be particularly competitive, especially for grain and bulk commodities. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times and quality and reliability of service. While we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, trucks and barges are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any future improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation, or legislation releasing motor carriers from their size or weight limitations, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  

Key Suppliers  We depend on two key domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives. Due to the capital intensive nature of the locomotive manufacturing business and sophistication of this equipment, potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry in this industry. Therefore, if one of these domestic suppliers discontinues manufacturing locomotives for any reason, including insolvency or bankruptcy, we could experience a significant cost increase and risk reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary to our operations. Additionally, for a high percentage of our rail purchases, we utilize two suppliers (one domestic and one international) that meet our specifications. Rail is critical for both maintenance of our network and replacement and improvement or expansion of our network and facilities. Rail manufacturing also has high barriers to entry, and, if one of those suppliers discontinues operations for any reason, including insolvency or bankruptcy, we could experience cost increases and difficulty obtaining rail.

Employees  Approximately 86% of our 44,861 full-time-equivalent employees are represented by 14 major rail unions. In January 2010, the nations largest freight railroads began the current round of negotiations with the labor unions. Generally, contract negotiations with the various unions take place over an extended period of time. This round of negotiations was no exception. In September 2011, the rail industry reached agreements with the United Transportation Union. On November 5, 2011, a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) appointed by President Obama issued recommendations to resolve the disputes between the U.S. railroads and 11 unions that had not yet reached agreements. Since then, ten unions reached agreements with the railroads, all of them generally patterned on the recommendations of the PEB, and the unions subsequently ratified these agreements. The railroad industry reached a tentative agreement with the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees (BMWE) on February 2, 2012, eliminating the immediate threat of a national rail strike. The BMWE now will commence ratification of this tentative agreement by its members.  

Railroad Security  Operating a safe and secure railroad is first among our critical priorities and is a primary responsibility of all our employees. This emphasis helps us protect the public, our employees, our customers, and operations across our rail network. Our security efforts rely upon a wide variety of measures including employee training, cooperation with our customers, training of emergency responders, and partnerships with numerous federal, state, and local government agencies. While federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents, the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives.  

UPRR Security Measures  We maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and to respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise. The plan includes four levels of alert status, each with its own set of countermeasures. We employ our own police force, consisting of more than 215 commissioned and highly-trained officers. Our employees also undergo recurrent security and preparedness training, as well as federally-mandated hazardous materials and security training. We regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs to identify ways to increase preparedness and to improve security. We maintain the capability to move critical operations to back-up facilities in different locations.  

We have an emergency response management center, which operates 24 hours a day. The center receives reports of emergencies, dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions, and other safety and security issues from our employees, the public, and law enforcement and other government officials. In cooperation with government officials, we monitor both threats and public events, and, as necessary, we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities we serve and our operations. We comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law. We also design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers. Additionally, in compliance with new Transportation Security Agency regulations that took effect on April 1, 2009, we deployed new information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of Rail Security Sensitive Material with customers and interchange partners.  

We also have established a number of our own innovative safety and security-oriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to The Officer on the Train program, which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks. Our staff of information security professionals continually assesses cyber security risks and implements mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment.  

Cooperation with Federal, State, and Local Government Agencies  We work closely on physical and cyber security initiatives with government agencies ranging from the DOT and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to local police departments, fire departments, and other first responders. In conjunction with DOT, DHS, and other railroads, we sponsor Operation Respond, which provides first responders with secure links to electronic railroad resources, including mapping systems, shipment records, and other essential information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations. We also participate in the National Joint Terrorism Task Force, a multi-agency effort established by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to combat and prevent terrorism.

We work with the Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Military Transport Management Command to monitor shipments entering the UPRR rail network at U.S. border crossings and ports. We were the first railroad in the U.S. to be named a partner in CBPs Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, a partnership designed to develop, enhance, and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain.  

Cooperation with Customers and Trade Associations  Along with other railroads, we work with the American Chemistry Council to train more than 200,000 emergency responders each year. We work closely with our chemical shippers to establish plant security plans, and we continue to take steps to more closely monitor and track hazardous materials shipments. In cooperation with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and other railroads, we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials.  

GOVERNMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION  

Governmental Regulation  Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations, generally applicable to all businesses. (See also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in Legal Proceedings, Item 3.)  

The operations of the Railroad are also subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the STB. The STB has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic; common carrier service of regulated traffic; freight car compensation; transfer, extension, or abandonment of rail lines; and acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The STB launched wide-ranging proceedings to explore whether to expand rail regulation, and we actively participated. The STB has not yet taken further action and denied a petition seeking one form of access regulation. Additionally, several bills were introduced in the U.S. Senate in early 2011 that would expand the regulatory authority of the STB and could include new antitrust provisions. We continue to monitor these proposed bills.  

The operations of the Railroad also are subject to the regulations of the FRA and other federal and state agencies. On January 12, 2010, the FRA issued final rules governing installation of Positive Train Control (PTC) by the end of 2015. Although still under development, PTC is a collision avoidance technology intended to override locomotive controls and stop a train before an accident. The FRA acknowledged that projected costs will exceed projected benefits by a ratio of about 22 to one, and we estimate that our costs will be higher than the FRA assumed. Congress has directed the FRA to provide an early report by March 1, 2012, on the status of PTC implementation, which is in advance of a detailed report due by the end of 2012. Through 2011, we have invested nearly $400 million in the development of PTC.  

DOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and DHS, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, emissions requirements, and equipment standards. The Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, among other things, revised hours of service rules for train and certain other railroad employees, mandated implementation of PTC, imposed passenger service requirements, addressed safety at rail crossings, increased the number of safety related employees of the FRA, and increased fines that may be levied against railroads for safety violations. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.  

Environmental Regulation  We are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment. The statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by various state environmental agencies. The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions; and the Clean Water Act, regulating waste water discharges.  

Information concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies  Environmental, Item 7 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
