SCE&G’s sales of electricity and margins earned from those sales by customer classification as percentages of electric revenues were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales for resale include sales to three municipalities and one electric cooperative. Short-term system sales and margins were not significant for either period presented.

During 2015 SCE&G experienced a net increase of approximately 10,000 electric customers (growth rate of 1.5%), increasing its total electric customers to approximately 698,000 at year end.

For the period 2016-2018, SCE&G projects total territorial kWh sales of electricity to increase 1.4% annually (assuming normal weather), total retail sales to grow 1.4% annually (assuming normal weather), total electric customer base to increase 1.6% annually and territorial peak load (summer, in MW) to increase 2.4% annually. SCE&G projects a retail kWh sales decrease of approximately 1.1% and customer growth of 1.7% from 2015 to 2016. SCE&G’s goal is to maintain a planning reserve margin of between 14% and 20%; however, weather and other factors affect territorial peak load and can cause actual generating capacity on any given day to fall below the reserve margin goal. 

Electric Interconnections

SCE&G purchases all of the electric generation of GENCO’s Williams Station under a Unit Power Sales Agreement which has been approved by FERC. Williams Station has a net generating capacity (summer rating) of 605 MW.

SCE&G’s transmission system extends over a large part of the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. The system interconnects with Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, Duke Energy Progress, LLC, Santee Cooper, Georgia

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For a listing of the Company's generating facilities, see the Electric Properties section within ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. 

In 2015, coal was primarily obtained through long-term supply contracts with suppliers located in eastern Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. These contracts provide for approximately 2.0 million tons annually. Sulfur restrictions on the contract coal range from 1.0% to 1.6%. These contracts expire at various times through 2018. Spot market purchases may occur when needed or when prices are believed to be favorable. The Company relies on unit trains and, in some cases, trucks and barges for coal deliveries. 

SCANA and SCE&G believe that SCE&G’s operations comply with all applicable regulations relating to the discharge of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. See additional discussion at Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, and Westinghouse are parties to a fuel alliance agreement and contracts for fuel fabrication and related services. Under these contracts, SCE&G supplies enriched product to Westinghouse and Westinghouse supplies nuclear fuel assemblies for Summer Station Unit 1 and will supply assemblies for the New Units. Westinghouse will be SCE&G’s exclusive provider of such fuel assemblies on a cost-plus basis. The fuel assemblies to be delivered under the contracts are expected to supply the nuclear fuel requirements of Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units through 2033. SCE&G is dependent upon Westinghouse for providing fuel assemblies for the new AP1000 reactors in the New Units in the current and anticipated future absence of other commercially viable sources. 

In addition, SCE&G has contracts covering its nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services and enrichment services. These contracts have varying expiration dates through 2024. SCE&G believes that it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services and that

sufficient capacity for nuclear fuel supplies and processing exists to preclude the impairment of normal operations of its nuclear generating units.

SCE&G stores spent nuclear fuel in its on-site spent-fuel pool, and has constructed a dry cask storage facility to accommodate the spent fuel output for the life of Summer Station Unit 1. In addition, Summer Station Unit 1 has sufficient on-site storage capacity to permit storage of the entire reactor core in the event that complete unloading should become desirable or necessary. For information about the contract with the DOE regarding disposal of spent fuel, see the Environmental section of Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements of SCANA and SCE&G.

SCE&G also uses long-term power purchase agreements to ensure that adequate power supply resources are in place to meet load obligations and reserve requirements. As of December 31, 2015, SCE&G had such agreements in place for 325 MW of capacity.

GAS OPERATIONS

Gas Sales-Regulated

Regulated sales of natural gas by customer classification as a percent of total regulated gas revenues sold or transported were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For the period 2016-2018, SCANA projects total consolidated sales of regulated natural gas in MMBTUs to increase 1.7% annually (excluding transportation and assuming normal weather). Annual projected increases over such period in MMBTU sales include residential of 2.6%, commercial of 1.2% and industrial of 0.8%.

For the period 2016-2018, SCE&G projects total consolidated sales of regulated natural gas in MMBTUs to increase 1.4% annually (excluding transportation and assuming normal weather). Annual projected increases over such period in MMBTU sales include residential of 2.6%, commercial of 0.8% and industrial of 1.1%.

For the period 2016-2018, each of SCANA’s and SCE&G’s total regulated natural gas customer base is projected to increase 2.6% annually. During 2015 SCANA recorded a net increase of approximately 22,000 regulated gas customers (growth rate of 2.6%), increasing its regulated gas customers to approximately 881,000. Of this increase, SCE&G recorded a net increase of approximately 9,000 gas customers (growth rate of 2.7%), increasing its total gas customers to approximately 347,000 (as of December 31, 2015).

Demand for gas changes primarily due to weather and the price relationship between gas and alternate fuels.

Gas Cost, Supply and Curtailment Plans

 SCE&G purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers in both the spot and long-term markets. The gas is delivered to South Carolina through firm transportation agreements with Southern Natural (expiring in 2018), Transco (expiring at various times through 2031) and DCGT (expiring at various times through 2030). The maximum daily volume of gas that SCE&G is entitled to transport under these contracts is 212,194 MMBTU from Southern Natural, 104,652 MMBTU from Transco and 449,727 MMBTU from DCGT. Additional natural gas volumes may be delivered to SCE&G’s system as capacity is available through interruptible transportation.

The daily volume of gas that SEMI is entitled to transport under service agreements with DCGT (expiring in 2016, 2017 and 2023) on a firm basis is 83,704 MMBTU.

SCE&G purchased natural gas, including fixed transportation, at an average cost of $3.67 per MMBTU during 2015 and $5.48 per MMBTU during 2014.

SCE&G was allocated 5,502,600 MMBTU of natural gas storage capacity on the systems of Southern Natural and Transco. Approximately 4,558,600 MMBTU of gas were in storage on December 31, 2015. To meet the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during periods of maximum demand, SCE&G supplements its supplies of natural gas with two LNG liquefaction storage facilities, one of which has liquefaction capability. The LNG plants are capable of storing the liquefied equivalent of 1,964,600 MMBTU of natural gas. Approximately 1,842,800 MMBTU (liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage on December 31, 2015.

PSNC Energy purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers on a short-term basis at market based prices and on a long-term basis for reliability assurance at first of the month index prices plus a reservation charge in certain cases. Transco transports natural gas to North Carolina through transportation agreements with varying expiration dates through 2032. On a peak day, PSNC Energy is capable of receiving daily transportation volumes of natural gas under these contracts, utilizing firm contracts of 710,062 MMBTU from Transco.

PSNC Energy purchased natural gas, including fixed transportation, at an average cost of $4.12 per MMBTU during 2015 compared to $5.67 per MMBTU during 2014.

To meet the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during periods of maximum demand, PSNC Energy supplements its supplies of natural gas with underground natural gas storage services and LNG peaking services. Underground natural gas storage service agreements with Dominion Transmission, Inc., Columbia Gas Transmission, Transco and Spectra Energy provide for storage capacity of approximately 13,000,000 MMBTU. Approximately 11,000,000 MMBTU of gas were in storage under these agreements at December 31, 2015. In addition, PSNC Energy’s LNG facility can store the liquefied equivalent of 1,000,000 MMBTU of natural gas with regasification capability of approximately 100,000 MMBTU per day. Approximately 900,000 MMBTU (liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage at December 31, 2015. LNG storage service agreements with Transco, Cove Point LNG and Pine Needle LNG provide for 1,300,000 MMBTU (liquefied equivalent) of storage space. Approximately 1,300,000 MMBTU (liquefied equivalent) were in storage under these agreements at December 31, 2015.

SCANA and SCE&G believe that supplies under long-term contracts and supplies available for spot market purchase are adequate to meet existing customer demands and to accommodate growth.

Gas Marketing-Nonregulated

SEMI markets natural gas and provides energy-related services in the Southeast. In addition, SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI, markets natural gas to approximately 450,000 customers (as of December 31, 2015) in Georgia’s natural gas market.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* SCE&G operates the Saluda hydroelectric project under an annual license while its long-term re-licensing application is being reviewed by FERC.

At the termination of a license under the Federal Power Act, FERC may extend or issue a new license to the previous licensee, or may issue a license to another applicant, or the federal government may take over the related project. If the federal government takes over a project or if FERC issues a license to another applicant, the federal government or the new licensee, as the case may be, must pay the previous licensee an amount equal to its net investment in the project, not to exceed fair value, plus severance damages.

RATE MATTERS

For a discussion of the impact of various rate matters, see the Regulatory Matters section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G, and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G.

Fuel Cost Recovery Procedures

The SCPSC’s fuel cost recovery procedure determines the fuel component in SCE&G’s retail electric base rates annually based on projected fuel costs for the ensuing 12-month period, adjusted for any over-collection or under-collection from the preceding 12-month period. The statutory definition of fuel costs includes certain variable environmental costs, such as ammonia, lime, limestone and catalysts consumed in reducing or treating emissions. The definition also includes the cost of emission allowances used for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and particulates. In 2014, the South Carolina General Assembly amended the statutory definition of fuel cost thereby allowing electric utilities to recover avoided costs under the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978. The South Carolina General Assembly further amended the fuel cost statute to allow for the recovery of costs incurred as a result of offering DER programs and net metering to its customers as a separate component of the overall fuel factor. SCE&G may request a formal proceeding concerning its fuel costs at any time. 

Fuel cost recovery procedures related to the Company's natural gas operations along with related rate proceedings by the SCPSC and NCUC are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Federal and state authorities have imposed environmental regulations and standards relating primarily to air emissions, wastewater discharges and solid, toxic and hazardous waste management. Developments in these areas may require that equipment and facilities be modified, supplemented or replaced. The ultimate effect of any new or pending regulations or standards upon existing operations cannot be predicted. For a discussion of how these regulations and standards may impact SCANA and SCE&G (including capital expenditures necessitated thereby), see the Environmental Matters section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G.

OTHER MATTERS

Insurance coverage for SCE&G's nuclear units is described in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G.
