PART I

Item 1. Business.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Founded in 1901 as a retail shoe business in Seattle, Nordstrom later incorporated in Washington state in 1946 and went on to become one of the leading fashion retailers based in the U.S. We provide customers with a differentiated and seamless customer experience through our robust ecommerce platform and high-quality store portfolio in top North American markets. As of March 19, 2018, we operate 363 U.S. stores located in 40 states as well as six Nordstrom full-line stores in Canada. The west coast of the U.S. is the area in which we have the largest presence. We have two reportable segments, which include Retail and Credit. 

As of March 19, 2018, the Retail segment includes:

•117 Nordstrom-branded full-line stores in the U.S., including Nordstrom Local

•six Canada full-line stores

•full-price Nordstrom.com website and mobile application

•235 off-price Nordstrom Rack stores

•off-price Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook website and mobile application

•seven Trunk Club clubhouses and TrunkClub.com website

•two “Last Chance” clearance stores

•two Jeffrey boutiques

Through these multiple retail channels, we strive to deliver the best customer experience possible. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label merchandise focused on apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories. 

Our integrated Nordstrom full-line stores and digital store allow us to provide our customers with a seamless shopping experience. In-store purchases are primarily fulfilled from that store’s inventory, but when inventory is unavailable at that store, it may also be shipped to our customers from our fulfillment centers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania (“East Coast”), or from other Nordstrom full-line stores. Online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers from our Cedar Rapids and East Coast fulfillment centers, but may also be shipped from our Nordstrom full-line stores. We engage with our customers on their terms, blurring the lines between the digital and in-store experience. Our customers can pick up online orders in our Nordstrom full-line stores if inventory is available at one of our locations, or reserve clothes online to try in store in many of our locations. Nordstrom Local is a test retail concept that is focused on services, providing customers convenient access to personal stylists, alterations, online orders and more. We also leverage the expertise of our salespeople to enable customers to receive personalized product recommendations on their mobile phones through our digital Style Board selling tool. These capabilities allow us to better serve customers across various channels and improve sales. 

Nordstrom Rack stores purchase merchandise primarily from the same vendors carried in Nordstrom full-line stores and also serve as outlets for clearance merchandise from our Nordstrom stores and other retail channels. Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook offers a consistent selection of off-price merchandise, as well as limited-time sale events on fashion and lifestyle brands and are integrated with a single customer log-in, shared shopping cart and streamlined checkout process. Nordstromrack.com combines the technology expertise of HauteLook with the merchant expertise of Nordstrom Rack. Online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers from our San Bernardino, California and East Coast fulfillment centers. Furthermore, we can accommodate returns from these sites by mail or at any Nordstrom Rack location. 

Through our Credit segment, our customers can access a variety of payment products and services, including a selection of Nordstrom-branded Visa® credit cards in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a Nordstrom-branded private label credit card and a debit card for Nordstrom purchases. When customers use a Nordstrom-branded credit or debit card, they also participate in our loyalty program that provides benefits based on their level of spending. Although the primary purposes of our Credit segment are to foster greater customer loyalty and drive more sales, we also receive credit card revenue through our program agreement with TD Bank, N.A. (“TD”) (see Note 2: Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 8).

We invested early in our omni-channel capabilities, integrating our operations, merchandising and technology across our stores and online, in both our Nordstrom full-price and Nordstrom Rack off-price businesses. Today, we have more than 60 combinations in which merchandise is ordered, fulfilled and delivered. Though this has enabled us to serve customers in multiple ways, we are focused on providing a seamless experience for our customer across stores and online. As a result of the evolution of our operations, our reportable segments have become progressively more integrated such that we will change our reportable segments to one reportable segment to align with how management will view the results of our operations in the first quarter of 2018. For more information about our business and our reportable segments, see Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 15: Segment Reporting in Item 8.

FISCAL YEAR

We operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31st. References to 2017 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, 2018. References to any other years included within this document are based on a 52-week fiscal year. 

RETURN POLICY

We have a fair and reasonable approach to returns, handling them on a case-by-case basis with the ultimate objective of making our customers happy. We have no formal return policy on how long we accept returns at our Nordstrom full-line stores or online at Nordstrom.com. Our goal is to take care of our customers, which includes making returns and exchanges easy, whether in stores or online, where we offer free shipping on purchases and returns. Our Nordstrom Rack stores generally accept returns up to 90 days from the date of purchase with the original price tag and sales receipt and accept returns of Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook merchandise. Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook generally accepts returns of apparel, footwear, accessories and HauteLook home products within 90 days from the date of shipment. Beginning in 2018, our off-price channels accept returns 45 days from the date of purchase or shipment.

SEASONALITY

Our business, like that of other retailers, is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Due to our Anniversary Sale in July and the holidays in the fourth quarter, our sales are typically higher in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters of the fiscal year. Consistent with the timing in 2016, our 2017 Anniversary Sale began in the third week of July and extended one week into the third quarter. 

NORDSTROM REWARDS

Our Nordstrom Rewards™ loyalty program, which rewards customers based on their level of spending, is one area that enables us to directly engage and strengthen relationships with customers while driving incremental sales and trips. Upon reaching certain point thresholds, customers receive Nordstrom Notes® (“Notes”), which can be redeemed for goods or services. In May 2016, we expanded the program to any customer interested in participating, when historically this program was offered only to Nordstrom cardholders. Notes can be earned and redeemed at Nordstrom full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Nordstrom Rack and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook. Nordstrom cardholders can also earn rewards at Trunk Club. Customers who participate in our Nordstrom Rewards loyalty program through our credit and debit cards receive additional benefits including reimbursements for alterations, Personal Triple Points days, shopping and fashion events and early access to the Anniversary Sale.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

We operate in a highly competitive business environment. We compete with other international, national, regional and local retailers, including internet-based businesses, omni-channel department stores, specialty stores, off-price stores and boutiques, that may carry similar lines of merchandise. Our specific competitors vary from market to market. We believe the keys to competing in our industry are providing great customer service and customer experiences in stores and online. This includes offering compelling price and value, fashion newness, quality of products, selection, convenience, technology, product fulfillment, personalization and appealing, relevant store environments in top locations.

INVENTORY

We plan our merchandise purchases and receipts to coincide with expected sales trends. For instance, our merchandise purchases and receipts increase prior to our Anniversary Sale, which has historically extended over the last two weeks of July. We also purchase and receive a larger amount of merchandise in the fall as we prepare for the holiday shopping season (from late November through December). At Nordstrom Rack, we invest in pack and hold inventory, which involves the strategic purchase of merchandise from some of our full-line stores’ top brands in advance of the upcoming selling seasons, to take advantage of favorable buying opportunities. This inventory is typically held for six months on average and has been an important component of Nordstrom Rack’s inventory strategy. 

In order to offer merchandise that our customers want, we purchase from a wide variety of high-quality domestic and foreign suppliers. We also have arrangements with agents and contract manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise. We expect our suppliers to meet our “Nordstrom Partnership Guidelines,” which address our corporate social responsibility standards for matters such as legal and regulatory compliance, labor, health and safety and the environment. This is available on our website at Nordstrom.com.

EMPLOYEES

During 2017, we employed approximately 72,500 employees on a full- or part-time basis. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, employment increased to approximately 75,000 employees in July 2017 and 76,000 in December 2017. All of our employees are non-union. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.

TRADEMARKS

We have 193 trademarks, each of which is the subject of one or more trademark registrations and/or trademark applications. Our most notable trademarks include Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, HauteLook and Trunk Club. Our most notable brand trademarks include Halogen, BP., Nordstrom, Zella, Caslon, Tucker+Tate and 14th & Union. Each of our trademarks is renewable indefinitely, provided that it is still used in commerce at the time of the renewal.
