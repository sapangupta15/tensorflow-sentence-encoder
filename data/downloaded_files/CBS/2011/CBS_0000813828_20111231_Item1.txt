 CBS CORP. BUSINESS SEGMENTS  

 Entertainment (52%, 53% and 54% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively)  

 The Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network; CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International and CBS Television Distribution, the Company's television production and syndication operations; CBS Films, the Company's producer and distributor of theatrical motion pictures; and CBS Interactive, the Company's online content networks for information and entertainment.  

 Television Network. The CBS Television Network through CBS Entertainment, CBS News® and CBS Sports® distributes a comprehensive schedule of news and public affairs broadcasts, sports and entertainment programming to more than 200 domestic affiliates reaching throughout the U.S., including 16 of the Company's owned and operated television stations, and to affiliated stations in certain U.S. territories. The CBS Television Network primarily derives revenues from the sales of advertising time for its network broadcasts.  

 CBS Entertainment is responsible for acquiring or developing and scheduling the entertainment programming presented on the CBS Television Network, which includes primetime comedy and drama series, reality-based programming, specials, children's programs, daytime dramas, game shows and late-night programs. CBS News operates a worldwide news organization, providing the CBS Television Network and the CBS Radio Network with regularly scheduled news and public affairs broadcasts, including 60 Minutes®, 48 Hours Mystery®, CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley,  CBS This Morning, CBS Sunday Morning® and Face the Nation® as well as special reports. CBS News off-network production units produce programming for domestic and international outlets, including the CBS Television Network, cable television, home video, audio-book and in-flight markets, as well as schools and libraries. CBS News also provides CBS Newspath®, a television news syndication service that offers daily news coverage, sports highlights and news features to the CBS Television Network affiliates and other subscribers worldwide. CBS Sports broadcasts include The NFL Today, certain games from the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament (including the NCAA Men's Final Four), the PGA Golf Tour, Masters Tournament and PGA Championship, the U.S. Open Tennis Championships, regular-season college football and basketball games on network television, in addition to the NFL's American Football Conference (AFC) regular-season, post-season divisional playoff and championship games. CBS Sports has rights to broadcast the AFC through the 2013 season, including the broadcast of the 2013 Super Bowl. In December 2011, CBS extended its rights with the NFL to broadcast the AFC from the 2014 season through the 2022 season, including certain National Football Conference regular season games and the Super Bowls in 2016, 2019 and 2022. CBS Home Entertainment licenses home video rights and CBS Consumer Products licenses merchandising rights.  

 The CW, a broadcast network and the Company's 50/50 joint venture with Warner Bros. Entertainment, was launched in Fall 2006. The CW's programming includes Gossip Girl, 90210, The Vampire Diaries and America's Next Top Model. Nine of the Company's owned television stations are affiliates of The CW. In 2011, license agreements were entered into with each of Hulu, LLC and Netflix, Inc. to permit the streaming of certain of The CW's programming.  

 Television Production and Syndication. The Company, through CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International and CBS Television Distribution, produces, acquires and/or distributes programming  

I-2 

worldwide, including series, specials, news and public affairs. Such programming is produced primarily for broadcast on network television, exhibition on basic cable and premium subscription services or distribution via first-run syndication. First-run syndication is programming exhibited on television stations without prior exhibition on a network or cable service. The Company also distributes off-network syndicated programming, which is programming exhibited on television stations, cable networks or video-on-demand services following its exhibition on a network, basic cable network or premium subscription service.  

 Programming that was produced or co-produced by the Company's production group and is broadcast on network television includes, among others, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation (CBS), NCIS (CBS), The Good Wife (CBS) and  90210 (The CW). Generally, a network will license a specified number of episodes for broadcast on the network in the U.S. during a license period. Remaining distribution rights, including foreign and/or off-network syndication rights, are typically retained by the Company or, in the case of co-productions, distribution rights are shared with the co-producer for U.S. or foreign markets. The network license fee for a series episode is normally lower than the costs of producing the episode; however, the Company's objective is to recoup its costs and earn a profit through international and domestic syndication of episodes. International sales are generally made within one year of U.S. network run. Generally, a series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic syndication. In off-network syndication, the Company distributes series such as CSI:, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, Criminal Minds, NCIS and NCIS: Los Angeles as well as a library of older television programs. The Company also produces and/or distributes first-run syndicated series such as Wheel of Fortune, Jeopardy!, Entertainment Tonight, Inside Edition, The Insider, Dr. Phil, Rachael Ray and Judge Judy. The Company also distributes syndicated and other programming internationally. The Company has entered into agreements for digital streaming of its programming in the U.S. and certain other countries. The Company entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with Netflix, Inc., for streaming various programming from the Company's library on Netflix's subscription video-on-demand services in July 2011 for Canada and Latin America and, in October 2011, for the U.K. In September 2011, the Company entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Hulu Japan LLC for streaming various programs from the Company's library on Hulu's subscription video-on-demand service in Japan. In February 2011 and July 2011, the Company entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with each of Netflix, Inc. and Amazon Digital Services, Inc., respectively, to stream various programs from the Company's library on each of Netflix's and Amazon's subscription video-on-demand services in the U.S.  

 License fees for completed television programming in syndication, on cable and video-on-demand and digitally streamed are recorded as revenues in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in the Entertainment segment's operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were approximately $1.25 billion and $654 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.  

 The Company continues to expand its global channel presence through international joint ventures. The Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture with Reliance Broadcast Network Limited which operates three English language and one Punjabi language general entertainment television channels customized for the Indian market and surrounding territory, the first of which,  BIG CBS Prime, launched in November 2010, followed by the launches in 2011 of each of BIG CBS Love and BIG CBS Spark and the launch in 2012 of BIG CBS Spark Punjabi. Also, the Company owns an approximately 33% interest in a joint venture with a subsidiary of Ten Network Holdings Limited to provide content to  ELEVEN, a digital multichannel service which launched in Australia in January 2011. In addition, the Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture with Chellozone (UK) Limited, a subsidiary of Liberty Global, Inc., which owns and operates six television channels in the U.K. and Ireland, including CBS Action, CBS Drama and CBS Reality; and an approximately 33% interest in a joint venture, which owns two pay television channels in Australia called  TV1 and Sci Fi.  

I-3 

 CBS Films. CBS Films produces, acquires and distributes theatrical motion pictures across all genres. The budget for each picture is intended to be up to $50 million plus advertising and marketing costs at a level consistent with industry custom. The majority of motion pictures produced or acquired by CBS Films is intended for a wide, commercial theatrical release, similar to motion pictures typically produced and released by major studios. CBS Films' theatrical releases in 2011 were The Mechanic and Beastly. Theatrical releases in 2012 include The Woman in Black,  Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, and 7500.  

 In general, motion pictures produced or acquired by CBS Films are exhibited theatrically in the U.S. and internationally, followed by exploitation via home entertainment (including DVD and electronic rental and sell-through), video-on-demand, pay-per-view, pay television, free television and basic cable, digital media outlets and, in some cases, other channels such as airlines and hotels. CBS Films will exploit its motion pictures (including certain ancillary rights, such as licensing and merchandising) and generate revenues in all media in the relevant release windows either directly, through affiliated CBS entities, or via third party distribution arrangements.  

 CBS Interactive. CBS Interactive operates one of the leading global publishers of premium content on the Internet. CBS Interactive was ranked among the top Internet properties in the world according to comScore Media Metrix, December 2011. CBS Interactive's leading brands, including CNET,  CBS.com, CBSSports.com, GameSpot,  TV.com, CBSNews.com, ZDNet, Last.fm, and MetroLyrics.com, among others, serve targeted audiences with text, video, audio, and mobile content spanning technology, entertainment, sports, news, business, gaming and music categories. In addition to its U.S.-based business, CBS Interactive operates in Asia and Europe. CBS Interactive's worldwide brands reached approximately 246 million unique monthly visitors during December 2011 according to comScore Media Metrix, December 2011.  

 CBS Interactive generates revenue principally from the sale of advertising and sponsorships, in addition to fees derived from search and commerce partners, licensing fees, subscriptions, e-commerce activities, and other paid services. Advertising spending on the Internet, as in traditional media, fluctuates significantly with economic conditions. In addition, online marketing spending follows seasonal consumer behavior throughout the calendar year to reflect trends during the calendar year.  

 CNET.com is one of the preeminent Websites for technology and consumer electronics information and features news, reviews, downloads and instructional and entertaining video and audio shows about technology. GameSpot is a leading gaming information Website providing video game reviews and previews, news, Webcasts, videos, and game downloads. CBSSports.com provides sports content, fantasy sports, community and e-commerce features. CBSSports.com owns and operates CBSCollegeSports.com College Network and  MaxPreps.com. TV.com is a destination for entertainment and community around television where visitors can watch videos and discuss and obtain information about television shows across all networks. CBS Interactive also operates CBS.com, the online destination for CBS Television Network programming. Through the CBS Audience Network, the Company delivers content from its Websites and television, radio and affiliated stations, in connection with new and existing advertiser-supported deals. The growing slate of CBS entertainment, news and sports content available online includes full episodes, clips and highlights based on CBS and Showtime Networks programming as well as original made-for-the-Web content. CBS Interactive Music Group operates Last.fm, a music discovery and social networking site, and MetroLyrics.com, a top song lyrics online database acquired by the Company in October 2011.   

 Entertainment Competition.   

 Television Network. The television broadcast environment is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in broadcast television are the development and acquisition of popular programming and the development of audience interest through programming and promotion, in order to sell advertising at profitable rates. Broadcast networks like CBS compete for audience, advertising revenues and programming with other broadcast networks such as ABC, FOX, NBC, The CW and MyNetworkTV,  

I-4 

independent television stations, cable program services as well as other media, including DVDs, print and the Internet. In addition, the CBS Television Network competes with the other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television stations in markets across the country, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience. According to Nielsen Media Research, for the broadcast television primetime daypart for the period September 19, 2011 to February 5, 2012, the CBS Television Network secured the #1 position for total viewers and for key adult viewers ages 25-54 and the #2 position for key adult viewers ages 18-49.  

 Television Production and Syndication. As a producer and distributor of programming, the Company competes with studios, television production groups, and independent producers and syndicators such as Disney, Fox, NBCUniversal, Sony and Warner Bros. to produce and sell programming both domestically and overseas. The Company also competes to obtain creative talent and story properties which are essential to the success of all of the Company's entertainment businesses.  

 CBS Films. Motion picture production and distribution is a highly competitive business. During the life cycle of the development and production of a motion picture project, CBS Films must compete for the rights to compelling underlying source material and talent such as writers, producers, directors, on screen performers and other creative personnel. Once a motion picture is completed, CBS Films must compete with numerous other motion pictures produced by various studios and independent producers including Paramount Pictures Corporation, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc., Lions Gate Entertainment, The Weinstein Company, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. and Lakeshore Entertainment Group LLC, among others, for audience acceptance as well as limited exhibition outlets across all of the relevant release windows. In addition, the ultimate consumer has many options for entertainment other than motion pictures including video games, sports, travel, outdoor recreation, the Internet, and other cultural and computer-related activities.  

 CBS Interactive. CBS Interactive competes with a variety of online properties for users, advertisers, and partners, including the following: general purpose portals such as AOL, MSN and Yahoo!, especially as these properties expand their content offerings; search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and MSN; online comparison shopping and retail properties, including Shopping.com, Amazon.com and eBay; vertical content sites in the categories that CBS Interactive's brands serve, such as technology, gaming, music, news, business, food, and lifestyle focused Websites; and platforms such as blogs, podcasts and video properties. CBS Interactive also competes for users and advertisers with diversified media companies that provide both online and offline content, including magazines, cable television, network television, radio and newspapers.  

 Cable Networks (11%, 10% and 10% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively)  

 The Cable Networks segment is composed of Showtime Networks, the Company's premium subscription program services;  CBS Sports Network, the Company's cable network devoted to college athletics; and Smithsonian Networks, a venture with Smithsonian Institution, which operates Smithsonian Channel.  

 Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks owns and operates three commercial-free, premium subscription program services in the U.S.:  Showtime, offering recently released theatrical feature films, original series, documentaries, boxing, mixed martial arts and other sports-related programming, and special events; The Movie Channel®, offering recently released theatrical feature films and related programming; and  Flix®, offering theatrical feature films primarily from the last several decades, as well as selected other titles. At December 31, 2011, Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix, in the aggregate, had approximately 73 million subscriptions in the U.S., certain U.S. territories and Bermuda.  

 Showtime Networks also owns and operates multiplexed channels of Showtime and The Movie Channel in the U.S. which offer additional and varied programming choices. In addition, Showtime Networks  

I-5 

transmits high definition feeds of Showtime, The Movie Channel and many of their multiplexed channels, and also makes versions of  Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix available "on demand," enabling subscribers to watch selected individual programs at their convenience (in both standard and high definition in the case of Showtime and The Movie Channel, and standard definition in the case of Flix). Showtime Networks also makes available Showtime Anytime®, a streaming on-demand authenticated version of Showtime, which can be accessed on computers via showtimeanytime.com or through an iPad® application free of charge to  Showtime subscribers as part of their Showtime subscription through participating Showtime Networks' distributors. Showtime Networks additionally operates the Website SHO.com and various mobile applications which promote  Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix programming, and provide information and entertainment and other services.  

 Showtime Networks derives revenue principally from the license of its program services to numerous cable, direct broadcast satellite ("DBS"), telephone company ("telco"), and other distributors, with a substantial portion of such revenue coming from three of the largest such distributors. The costs of acquiring exhibition rights to programming and producing original series are the principal expenses of Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks enters into commitments to acquire rights, with an emphasis on acquiring exclusive rights for  Showtime and The Movie Channel, from major or independent motion picture producers and other distributors typically covering the U.S. and Bermuda for varying durations. For example, in addition to a motion picture output agreement with CBS Films, Showtime Networks has entered into motion picture output agreements with Buena Vista Pay Television, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, for certain DreamWorks motion pictures, The Weinstein Company and Summit Entertainment for the exclusive U.S. premium subscription television rights for certain exhibition windows relating to feature films initially theatrically released in the U.S through December 2015 and, in the case of Summit Entertainment, December 2012. Showtime Networks' original series include Dexter®,  Homeland, Shameless, Weeds, The Borgias, Nurse Jackie, The Big C, Californication, House of Lies and Episodes, among others. Showtime Networks has entered into and may from time to time enter into co-financing, co-production and/or distribution arrangements with other parties to reduce the net cost to Showtime Networks for its original programming. In addition, Showtime Networks derives revenue by licensing rights it retains in certain of its original programming. For example, Showtime Networks and its corporate affiliate(s) have entered into licenses with television networks in various territories for exhibition of certain original series, as well as electronic sell-through arrangements with several Internet distributors, including iTunes and Amazon, among others, for certain Showtime programming. Showtime Networks also produces and/or provides special events to licensees on a pay-per-view basis through Showtime PPV®. 

 Showtime Networks also owns a majority of and manages Smithsonian Networks, a venture with Smithsonian Institution, which operates Smithsonian Channel, a basic cable service in the U.S., featuring programs of a cultural, historical, scientific and educational nature. Smithsonian Networks has launched both standard and high definition versions of Smithsonian Channel, as well as of its companion on demand version.  

 CBS Sports Network. CBS Sports Network is a 24-hour cable program service that provides sports and related content, with a strong focus on college sports. The network features events from approximately 20 men's and women's sports and provides coverage of over 300 live events each year in addition to live studio shows and original programming. CBS Sports Network had approximately 44 million subscribers as of December 31, 2011. The network derives its revenues from subscription fees and the sale of advertising on its cable program service. CBS Sports Network has secured favorable positioning with four of the top five cable, DBS, telco and other distributors. CBS Sports Network and Comcast Corporation each owns a 50% interest in the mtn: MountainWest Sports Network, which exhibits Mountain West Conference athletics and is available to U.S. cable and satellite providers.  

I-6 

 Cable Networks Competition.   

 Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks primarily competes with other providers of premium subscription program services in the U.S.: Home Box Office, Inc. and Starz Entertainment, LLC. Competition among premium subscription program services in the U.S. is dependent on: (i) the production, acquisition and packaging of original series and other original programming and the acquisition and packaging of an adequate number of recently released theatrical motion pictures; and (ii) the offering of prices, marketing and advertising support and other incentives to cable, DBS, telco and other distributors for carriage so as to favorably position and package Showtime Networks' premium subscription program services to subscribers. Home Box Office, Inc. is the dominant company in the U.S. premium subscription program service category, offering two premium subscription program services, HBO and Cinemax. Showtime Networks competes with Home Box Office, Inc. and has a smaller share of the premium subscription program service category. Starz Entertainment, LLC owns Starz, another premium subscription program service, which competes with Showtime Networks' and Home Box Office, Inc.'s premium program services. Showtime Networks also competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with broadcast television, basic cable program services and other media, including DVDs, portable devices and the Internet.  

 The terms and favorable renewal of agreements with distributors for the distribution of the Company's subscription program services are important to the Company. Consolidation among multichannel video programming distributors and other marketplace factors make it more difficult to reach favorable terms and could have an adverse effect on revenues. In addition, new entrants, such as Netflix, Inc., providing programming or other services for cable and/or other platforms, including the Internet, are or could be competitive with and adversely affect the Company's media businesses, including Showtime Networks' subscription program service business.  

 Smithsonian Networks competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with non-fiction and other basic cable program services, including Discovery Channel, National Geographic Channel and History, as well as with broadcast television and other media, such as DVDs, portable devices and the Internet.  

 CBS Sports Network. CBS Sports Network' principally competes with other sports-oriented cable programming services for distribution and license fee revenue among cable, DBS, telco and other distributors, as well as for viewership and advertising revenue. Consolidation among cable operators has made it more difficult for newer channels to secure broad distribution. In addition, the largest cable providers have created sports tiers for newer sports programming services which have not, in many cases, achieved significant subscriber penetration or acceptance. Re-alignment of college athletic conferences and their member institutions may adversely impact CBS Sports Network's programming arrangements. CBS Sports Network also competes with other sports programming services, such as ESPN, NBC Sports Network and the FOX Sports Networks, in acquiring the television and multimedia rights to sporting events, resulting in increased rights fees and increased production expenses.  

 Publishing (6% of the Company's consolidated revenues in each of 2011, 2010 and 2009)  

 The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster, which publishes and distributes consumer books in the U.S. and internationally.  

I-7 

 Simon & Schuster publishes and distributes adult and children's consumer books in printed, digital and audio formats in the U.S. and internationally. Digital formats include audio downloads for the Apple iPod and other companies' MP3 players, electronic books for increasingly popular devices such as Amazon's Kindle, the Apple iPad and Barnes & Noble's NOOK, stand-alone applications for the Apple iPod and iPhone, and new hybrid text and video combinations. Simon & Schuster's major adult imprints include Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner, Atria Books®, Gallery Books, Touchstone® and Free Press. Simon & Schuster's major children's imprints include Simon Pulse®, Aladdin® and Simon & Schuster Books For Young Readers. Simon & Schuster also develops special imprints and publishes titles based on the products of certain CBS businesses as well as that of third parties and distributes products for other publishers. Simon & Schuster distributes its products directly and through third parties. Simon & Schuster also delivers content and promotes its products on general Internet sites as well as those linked to individual titles; its created assets include online videos showcasing Simon & Schuster authors and new releases on YouTube, Facebook, MSN.com, SimonandSchuster.com and other sites. International publishing includes the international distribution of English-language titles through Simon & Schuster UK, Simon & Schuster Canada, Simon & Schuster Australia, Simon & Schuster India and other distributors, as well as the publication of local titles by Simon & Schuster UK and Simon & Schuster Australia.  

 In 2011, Simon & Schuster published 233 New York Times bestsellers in hardcover, paperback and electronic formats, collectively, including 29 New York Times #1 bestsellers. Best-selling titles in 2011 include Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson, A Stolen Life by Jaycee Dugard and 11/22/63 by Stephen King. Bestselling children's titles from Simon & Schuster include City of Fallen Angels by Cassandra Clare, Dork Diaries 3 by Rachel Renee Russell, and World Without Heroes by Brandon Mull. Simon & Schuster Digital, through  SimonandSchuster.com, publishes original content, builds reader communities and promotes and sells Simon & Schuster's books over the Internet.  

 The consumer publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand in the summer months and during the end-of-year holiday season. Major new title releases represent a significant portion of Simon & Schuster's sales throughout the year. Simon & Schuster's top five accounts drive a significant portion of its annual revenue. Consumer print books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Company is subject to global trends and local economic conditions. In 2011, the sale of digital content represented approximately 17% of Simon & Schuster's revenues. The Company expects that electronic books will represent an increasing portion of Simon & Schuster revenues in the coming years.  

 Publishing Competition. The consumer publishing business is highly competitive and has been affected over the years by consolidation trends and new electronic distribution methods and models. Mass merchandisers and on-line retailers are significant factors in the industry contributing to the general trend toward consolidation in the retail channel. The growth of the electronic book market has impacted print book retailers and wholesalers and could result in a reduction of these channels for the sales and marketing of the Company's books. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions and competition may adversely affect book retailers' operations, including distribution of the Company's books. The Company must compete with other larger publishers such as Random House, Penguin Group, Hachette and Harper Collins for the rights to works by authors. Competition is particularly strong for well-known authors and public personalities. In addition, technological changes have made it increasingly possible for authors to self-publish and have led to the development of new digital distribution models in which the Company's books must compete with the availability of both a larger volume of books as well as non-book content. In recent years, the Company has experienced price pressure on new releases, for both printed and electronic formats, as a result of price competition among book retailers. In 2010, Simon & Schuster began to enter into agency arrangements with book retailers and wholesalers under which Simon & Schuster sells its electronic books directly to the consumer and sets the consumer price. The Company still faces price competition from retailers and from competing publishers that sell directly to consumers.  

I-8 

 Local Broadcasting (19%, 20% and 18% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively)  

 The Local Broadcasting segment is composed of CBS Television Stations, the Company's 29 owned broadcast television stations, and CBS Radio, through which the Company owns and operates 130 radio stations in 28 U.S. markets and related online properties. The Company operates local Websites in major U.S. markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Dallas, which combine the Company's television and radio local media brands online to provide the latest news, traffic, weather, and sports information as well as local discounts, directories and reviews to serve the local community.  

 CBS Television Stations. The Company owns 29 broadcast television stations through its CBS Television Stations group, all of which operate under licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the "Communications Act"). The licenses are renewable every eight years. The Company's television stations are located in the 7 largest, and 15 of the top 20, television markets in the U.S. The Company owns multiple television stations within the same designated market area ("DMA") in 9 major markets. These multiple station markets are: Los Angeles (market #2), Philadelphia (market #4), Dallas-Fort Worth (market #5), San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose (market #6), Boston (market #7), Detroit (market #11), Miami-Ft. Lauderdale (market #16), Sacramento-Stockton-Modesto (market #20), and Pittsburgh (market #23). The Company has entered into an agreement to purchase independent Long Island, New York station, WLNY-TV, which is subject to customary closing conditions. This acquisition would result in New York (market #1) also being a multiple television station market. This group of television stations enables the Company to reach a wide audience within and across geographically diverse markets in the U.S. The stations produce news and broadcast public affairs, sports and other programming to serve their local markets and offer CBS, The CW or MyNetworkTV programming and syndicated programming. The CBS Television Stations group principally derives its revenues from the sale of advertising time on its television stations. Substantially all of the Company's television stations operate Websites, many of which are combined with the Websites of the Company's radio stations in co-located markets, which promote the stations' programming, and provide news, information and entertainment, as well as other services. These Websites principally derive revenues from the sale of advertising.

 CBS Radio. The Company's radio broadcasting business operates through CBS Radio, one of the largest operators of radio stations in the U.S. CBS Radio owns and operates 130 radio stations serving 28 U.S. markets as of February 21, 2012. In January 2012, the Company acquired an additional radio station in the Washington, D.C. market. Virtually all of the Company's owned and operated radio stations are located in the 50 largest U.S. radio markets and approximately 75% in the 25 largest U.S. radio markets. Most of the Company's owned radio stations implement digital broadcasting. The Company's strategy generally is to operate radio stations in the largest markets and take advantage of the Company's ability to sell advertising across multiple markets and formats. The Company believes that it is favorably impacted by offering radio, television and outdoor advertising platforms in large markets. The "Radio Stations, Television Stations and Outdoor Advertising Displays" table below includes information with respect to the Company's radio stations in the top 25 U.S. radio markets.  

 CBS Radio's geographically dispersed stations serve diverse target demographics through a broad range of formats such as rock, classic hits/oldies, all-news, talk, Spanish language, adult contemporary, top 40/contemporary hit radio, urban, sports and country, and CBS Radio has established leading franchises in news, sports and personality programming. This diversity provides advertisers with the convenience of selecting stations to reach a targeted demographic or of selecting groups of stations to reach broad groups of consumers within and across markets and also reduces the Company's dependence on any single station, local economy, format or advertiser. At the same time, CBS Radio maintains substantial diversity in each market where its stations operate so that its stations can appeal to several demographic groups. CBS Radio's general programming strategies include employing popular on-air talent, some of whose broadcasts may be syndicated by CBS Radio using the services of a third party syndicator, broadcasting programming syndicated to it by others, acquiring the rights to broadcast sports play-by-play and producing and acquiring news content for its radio stations. The overall mix of each radio station's programming lineup is designed to fit the station's specific format and serve its local community.  

 The majority of CBS Radio's revenues are generated from the sale of local and national advertising. The major categories of radio advertisers include: automotive, retail, healthcare, telecommunications, fast food, beverage, movies and entertainment. CBS Radio is able to use the reach, diversity and branding of its radio stations to create unique division-wide marketing and promotional initiatives for major national advertisers of products and services. Advertising expenditures by local advertisers fluctuate, which has an effect on CBS Radio's revenues.  

 Substantially all of the Company's radio stations operate Websites, many of which are combined with the Websites of the Company's television stations in co-located markets, which promote the stations' programming, and provide news, information and entertainment, as well as other services. Also, CBS Radio operates Websites for its music radio stations. All of these Websites principally derive revenues from  

I-11 

the sale of advertising. CBS Radio is one of the most listened to online radio providers according to Triton Digital's monthly Top 20 Ranker for December 2011.   

 Local Broadcasting Competition.   

 CBS Television Stations. Television stations compete for programming, on-air talent, audiences and advertising revenues with other stations and cable networks in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, with respect to programming, with other station groups, and, in the case of advertising revenues, with other local and national media. The owned and operated television stations' competitive position is largely influenced by the quality of the syndicated programs and local news programs in time periods not programmed by the network; the strength of the CBS Television Network programming and, in particular, the viewership of the CBS Television Network in the time period immediately prior to the late evening news; and in some cases, by the quality of the broadcast signal.  

 CBS Radio. The Company's radio stations directly compete within their respective markets for audience, advertising revenues and programming with other radio stations, including those owned by other group owners such as Clear Channel Communications, Inc., Cumulus Media Inc., Emmis Communications Corporation, Entercom Communications Corp. and Radio One, Inc. The Company's radio stations, including its Internet and streaming activities, also compete with other media, such as broadcast, cable and DBS television, newspapers, magazines, direct mail, and the Internet, including services such as Pandora, Spotify and Rhapsody. The radio industry is also subject to competition from Sirius XM Radio Inc., which provides digital audio services to subscribers.  

 The Company's television and radio stations face increasing competition from newer technologies, including audio and visual programming delivered via the Internet, which create new ways for individuals to watch programming and listen to music and other content of their choosing while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements. Also, an increasingly broad adoption by consumers of portable digital devices could affect the ability of the Company's television and radio stations to attract audiences and advertisers.  

 Aggregate total revenues for the Company's radio stations for 2011 were ranked #1 or #2 in the top five U.S. markets by metro area population (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco, and Dallas-Fort Worth), according to the 2011 Market Total Revenues Performance Summary of Miller, Kaplan, Arase & Co., LLP.

 Outdoor (13% of the Company's consolidated revenues in each of 2011, 2010 and 2009)  

 The Company sells, through its Outdoor businesses, advertising space on various media, including billboards, transit shelters and other street furniture, buses, rail systems (in-car, station platform and terminal), mall kiosks and stadium signage and in retail stores. It has outdoor advertising operations in more than 100 markets in North America, including all 50 of the largest metropolitan markets in the U.S., 19 of the 20 largest metropolitan markets in Canada and all 45 of the largest metropolitan markets in Mexico. Additionally, Outdoor has the exclusive rights to manage advertising space on approximately 90% of the total bus fleet in the U.K. and has a variety of outdoor advertising displays in the Netherlands, France, Italy, Puerto Rico, the Republic of Ireland, Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and China. The Company operates its Outdoor businesses through CBS Outdoor in the U.S., Canada, South America and Europe, CBS Outernet® in the U.S. and  Vendor® in Mexico. The "Radio Stations, Television Stations and Outdoor Advertising Displays" table above includes information with regard to the Company's outdoor advertising properties in the top 25 U.S. radio markets.  

 The substantial majority of Outdoor's revenues is generated from the sale of local, regional and national advertising. Advertising rates for a particular display are based on supply and demand, which are influenced by the display's exposure known as "impressions", the demographics of the particular market and the location of the display within that market. Until recently, these impressions were not measured by independent third parties. Commencing in January 2011, metrics for fixed displays such as billboards and street furniture, including demographic information and audience views, are measured through the new "Eyes On" technology administered by the Traffic Audit Bureau, an independent agency formed by a number of major outdoor advertising vendors, including CBS Outdoor, advertising agencies and advertisers. These metrics facilitate the inclusion of Outdoor's inventory in the planning stages of media campaigns. The major categories of out-of-home advertisers include: entertainment, media, automotive, beverage, financial, real estate, retail, healthcare, telecommunications, restaurants, health and beauty aids, hotels and professional services. Out-of-home media industry advertising expenditures by retailers and the entertainment industry fluctuate, which has an effect on Outdoor's revenues.  

 Outdoor generally operates in the billboard, transit, street furniture and retail store advertising markets. Outdoor primarily operates two types of billboard advertising displays, commonly referred to as "bulletins" and "posters."  

 Billboard space is generally sold for periods ranging from 4 weeks to 12 months. Billboards are generally mounted on structures owned by Outdoor located on leased real property. Lease agreements are negotiated with both public and private landowners for varying terms ranging from month-to-month to year-to-year, can be for terms of 10 years or longer and may provide for renewal options. There is no significant concentration of billboards under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord.  

I-15 

 Transit advertising includes advertising on or in transit systems, including the interiors and exteriors of buses, trains and trams and at rail stations. Transit advertising contracts are negotiated with public transit authorities and private transit operators and generally provide for payment to the transit authority of a percentage of the revenues, a fixed payment, or the greater of a percentage of the revenues or a fixed payment. Where revenues are lower than anticipated, the minimum amount required to be paid to a transit authority may exceed, or be a high percentage of, the net advertising revenues received by Outdoor under that advertising contract. Due to the challenging advertising marketplace worldwide, certain transit contracts, including the London Underground contract, are operating at their minimum guarantee levels.  

 Street furniture displays, the most common of which are bus shelters, reach both vehicular and pedestrian audiences. Bus shelters are usually constructed, installed and maintained by Outdoor. Most of Outdoor's bus shelter contracts include revenue-sharing arrangements with a municipality or transit authority and often include minimum required payments. Street furniture contracts usually involve a competitive bidding process. Contracts are awarded on the basis of projected revenues to the municipality, including minimum payments, and Outdoor's willingness to construct public facilities, such as bus shelters, public toilets and information kiosks. In both its transit and street furniture negotiations, Outdoor seeks to reduce minimum payment obligations on new agreements and on renewal of existing agreements. There is no assurance that Outdoor will be successful in reducing its minimum payments, entering into new agreements or renewing certain existing agreements and any such agreements may provide a lesser return to the Company.  

 Newer technologies for outdoor advertising displays, such as changeable message displays and digital billboards using light-emitting diode and liquid crystal display technology, continue to evolve. The Company keeps apprised of and has adopted such new technologies as they evolve and mature. For example, Outdoor is utilizing digital technology containing moving images in the London Underground, New York City subways and in retail outlets through CBS Outernet. Outdoor is also building new digital billboards and digitizing the displays on previously static billboards. CBS Outernet, a leading distributor of video programming and advertising content to retail stores, enables customized messaging by region and retail environment. Generally, CBS Outernet enters into revenue-sharing arrangements with retailers based on advertising sales.  

 Outdoor's business strategy involves expanding its presence in major selected markets, to grow its revenues and cash flow by being a leading provider of out-of-home advertising services in the markets it serves, controlling costs, developing and entering into new markets and using advanced technologies to build greater awareness and promote tactical advertising. In addition, the Company purchases outdoor advertising assets within its existing markets or in contiguous markets. The Company believes that there will be continuing opportunities for implementing its acquisition and development strategies given the outdoor advertising industry's fragmentation. This is particularly true in the international markets where there are opportunities for Outdoor to increase profitability both from acquiring additional assets in or near its existing operations and from future acquisitions in new markets.  

 Outdoor Competition. The outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several large companies involved in outdoor advertising such as Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc., JCDecaux S.A., Cemusa Inc., Titan Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company as well as hundreds of smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of display faces in a single or a few local markets. The Company also competes with other media, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, the Internet and direct mail marketers, within their respective markets. In addition, it competes with a wide variety of out-of-home media, including advertising in shopping centers, airports, movie theaters, supermarkets and taxis. Advertisers compare relative costs of available media and cost-per-thousand impressions, particularly when delivering a message to customers with distinct demographic characteristics. In competing with other media, the outdoor advertising industry relies on its relative cost efficiency and its ability to reach a broad segment in a specific market or to target a particular geographic area or population with a particular demographic within that market. The Company keeps  

I-16 

apprised of the evolution of new technologies in the industry. As new technologies such as digital billboards prove desirable to Outdoor's customers and deliver appropriate returns on investment, the Company's costs could increase.  

 The Company believes that its strong emphasis in sales and customer service and its position as a leading provider of advertising services in each of its primary markets as well as its international inventory enables it to compete effectively with the other outdoor advertising companies, as well as other media, within those markets.  

 REGULATION  

 The Company's businesses are either subject to or affected by regulations of federal, state and local governmental authorities. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting these businesses are subject to change. The descriptions which follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the statutes, rules and regulations described herein. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed statutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company's businesses.   

 Intellectual Property and Privacy   

 Laws affecting intellectual property are of significant importance to the Company. (See "Intellectual Property" on page I-22).  

 Unauthorized Distribution of Copyrighted Content and Piracy. Unauthorized distribution, reproduction or display of copyrighted material over the Internet and through physical devices without regard to content owners' copyright rights in television programming, motion pictures, clips and books, such as through pirated DVDs, user-generated content, streaming, Internet downloads, file "sharing" and peer-to-peer services, is a threat to copyright owners' ability to protect and exploit their property. The Company is engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect its intellectual property and has participated in various litigations and public relations programs and legislative activity. In addition to these efforts, the Company continues to enter into and explore possibilities for commercial arrangements with various online providers to further protect and exploit its content.  

 Copyright Law and Content. In the U.S., the copyright term for authored works is the life of the author plus 70 years. For works made for hire, the copyright term is the shorter of 95 years from the first publication or 120 years from creation.  

 Privacy. The laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving, particularly as they relate to the Company's interactive businesses. The Company monitors and considers these laws and regulations in the design and operation of its Websites and legal and regulatory compliance programs.   

 Broadcasting   

 General. Television and radio broadcasting are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act. The Communications Act empowers the FCC, among other actions, to issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; determine stations' frequencies, locations and operating power; regulate some of the equipment used by stations; adopt other regulations to carry out the provisions of the Communications Act and other laws, including requirements affecting the content of broadcasts; and to impose penalties for violation of its regulations, including monetary forfeitures, short-term renewal of licenses and, in egregious cases, license revocation or denial of license renewals.  

 Under the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of the operation of cable and DBS systems and certain other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations.  

 Indecency and Profanity Regulation. The FCC's rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent or profane material because the vagueness of the  

I-17 

FCC's indecency/profanity definition makes it difficult to apply, particularly with respect to spontaneous, live programming. The FCC's maximum forfeiture penalty for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is $325,000 per indecent or profane utterance with a maximum forfeiture exposure of $3 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. The Company is and has been involved in litigation and, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on its broadcast stations included indecent or profane material. (See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial ConditionLegal MattersIndecency Regulation" on page II-34).  

 License Renewals. Radio and television broadcast licenses are typically granted for standard terms of eight years. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity and, with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations by the licensee of either the Communications Act or the FCC's rules and regulations and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC's rules and regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. The Company has a number of pending renewal applications, nine of which have been opposed by third parties (there are two opposed renewal applications for Radio and seven opposed renewal applications for Television Stations).  

 License Assignments. The Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC licensee. Third parties may oppose the Company's applications to transfer or acquire additional broadcast licenses.  

 Ownership Regulation. The Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have an official position or ownership interest, known as an "attributable" interest, above specific levels in broadcast stations as well as in other specified mass media entities. In seeking FCC approval for the acquisition of a broadcast radio or television station license, the acquiring person or entity must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC's ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the public interest.  

 In December 2007, the FCC concluded a proceeding which examined whether to modify its various ownership rules, but with the exception of the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule, the FCC declined to do so. In July 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the FCC's decision to refrain from modifying the various ownership rules and reinstated the former newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership ban. In 2011, the FCC launched the latest quadrennial review of its ownership rules. It has proposed modifying the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule and eliminating the radio-television cross-ownership rule. The FCC's current ownership rules are briefly summarized below.    

 Local Radio Ownership. The FCC's local radio ownership rule applies in all markets where the Company owns radio stations. Under that rule, one party may own up to eight radio stations in the largest markets, no more than five of which may be either AM or FM. With a few exceptions, the rule permits the common ownership of 8 radio stations in the top 50 markets, where CBS Radio has significant holdings. The Company's FM radio portfolio exceeds the FCC's numerical limit in one market, West Palm Beach, which is grandfathered. While the rules do not require the divestiture of any existing radio ownership combinations, the Company is not permitted to transfer its radio portfolio in that market intact, except to qualified small businesses.  

 Local Television Ownership. Under the FCC's local television ownership rule, one party may own up to two television stations in the same DMA, so long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top four-ranked stations in the market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of an acquisition is filed with the FCC, and at least eight independently owned and operating full-power television stations remain in the market following the acquisition. Further, without regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations, the rule permits the ownership of more than one television station within the same DMA so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap. Satellite    

I-18 

television stations that simply rebroadcast the programming of a "parent" television station are exempt from the local television ownership rule if located in the same DMA as the "parent" station.  

 Television National Audience Reach Limitation. Under the FCC's national television ownership rule, one party may not own television stations which reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. For purposes of calculating the total number of television households reached by a station, the FCC attributes a UHF television station with only 50% of the television households in its market. The Company currently owns and operates television stations that reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households but for purposes of the national ownership limitation, the Company's reach is less than this amount applying the UHF discount in accordance with the FCC's methodology.  

 Radio-Television Cross-Ownership Rule. The radio-television cross-ownership rule limits the common ownership of radio and television stations in the same market. The numeric limit varies according to the number of independent media voices in the market. The Company owns a combination of radio and television stations in the Los Angeles market in excess of the limit. As required by the FCC, the Company assigned radio station KFWB-AM in Los Angeles to a divestiture trust. The Company is a beneficiary of the trust. The trustee is operating the radio station and is responsible for selling the radio station to a third party, the closing of which would bring the Company into compliance with this cross-ownership rule.  

 Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership. The newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits the common ownership of a broadcast station and daily newspaper in the same market absent a waiver by the FCC.  

 Dual Network Rule. The dual network rule prohibits any of the four major networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, from combining.    

 Attribution of Ownership. Under the FCC's attribution rules, a direct or indirect purchaser of various types of securities of an entity which holds FCC licenses, such as the Company, could violate the foregoing FCC ownership regulations or policies if that purchaser owned or acquired an "attributable" interest in other media properties. Under the FCC's rules, an "attributable" interest for purposes of the FCC's broadcast ownership rules generally includes: equity and debt interests which combined exceed 33% of a licensee's total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of the licensee's total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-market media interest, whether television, radio, cable or newspaper; a 5% or greater direct or indirect voting stock interest, including certain interests held in trust, unless the holder is a qualified passive investor in which case the threshold is a 20% or greater voting stock interest; any equity interest in a limited liability company or a partnership, including a limited partnership, unless properly "insulated" from management activities; and any position as an officer or director of a licensee or of its direct or indirect parent. The FCC is reviewing its single majority voting shareholder attribution exemption, which renders as non-attributable voting interests up to 49% in a licensee controlled by a single majority voting shareholder. Because NAI holds an attributable interest in both the Company and Viacom Inc., the business of each company is attributable to the other for certain FCC purposes, which may have the effect of limiting and affecting the activities, strategic business alternatives and business terms available to the Company. (See Item 1A. "Risk FactorsThe Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities").    

 Alien Ownership. In general, the Communications Act prohibits foreign individuals or entities from owning more than 20% or more than 25%, depending on the circumstances, of the voting power or equity of the Company.    

I-19 

 Cable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations. The 1992 Cable Act and implementing FCC regulations govern the retransmission of commercial television stations by cable television operators. Every three years, a television station must elect, with respect to cable systems within its DMA, either "must carry" status, pursuant to which the cable system's carriage of the station is mandatory, or "retransmission consent," pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and secures instead the right to negotiate consideration in return for consenting to carriage. The Company has elected the retransmission consent option in substantially all cases for the period beginning January 1, 2009, and, since 2006, has implemented a systematic process of seeking monetary consideration for its retransmission consent.  

 Similarly, federal legislation and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by DBS operators. DBS operators are required to carry the signals of all local television broadcast stations requesting carriage in local markets in which the DBS operator carries at least one signal pursuant to the statutory local-to-local compulsory copyright license. Every three years, each television station in such markets must elect "must carry" or "retransmission consent" status, in a manner similar to that described above with respect to cable systems. Substantially all of the Company's owned and operated television stations are being transmitted into their local markets by the two major DBS operators pursuant to retransmission consent agreements.  

 Children's Television Programming. Federal legislation and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on television stations during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and require stations to broadcast on their main program stream three hours per week of educational and informational programming ("E/I programming") designed for children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also impose E/I programming requirements on each additional digital multicast program stream transmitted by television stations, with the requirement increasing in proportion to the additional hours of free programming offered on multicast channels. These rules also limit the display during children's programming of Internet addresses of Websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products.  

 Program Access. Under the Communications Act, vertically integrated cable programmers (more fully described below) are generally prohibited from offering different prices, terms or conditions to competing multichannel video programming distributors unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the FCC's regulations. The FCC's "program access" rules also limit the ability of a vertically integrated cable programmer to enter into exclusive distribution arrangements with cable operators. A cable programmer is considered to be vertically integrated under the FCC's program access attribution rules if it owns or is owned by a cable operator in whole or in part. Cable operators for this purpose may include telephone companies that provide video programming directly to subscribers.  

 The Company's wholly owned program services are not currently subject to the program access rules. The Company's flexibility to negotiate the most favorable terms available for carriage of these services and its ability to offer cable operators exclusive programming could be adversely affected if it were to become subject to the program access rules. Because the Company and Viacom Inc. are under common control by NAI, Viacom Inc.'s businesses could be attributable to the Company for purposes of the FCC's program access rules. (See Item 1A. "Risk FactorsThe Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities").  

 National Broadband Plan. In response to the FCC's March 2010 National Broadband Plan, which seeks to provide affordable broadband access throughout the U.S., Congress passed legislation in February 2012 authorizing the FCC to conduct voluntary auctions of spectrum utilized by broadcast television stations to provide additional spectrum for wireless broadband services. The television stations that continue their operations may have to change channels once the FCC "repacks" the broadcast spectrum dedicated to broadcast television use. The legislation provides that the FCC will assist television stations in retaining their current coverage areas, no stations will be forced into the VHF band and a fund  

I-20 

will be established to reimburse broadcasters for reasonable relocation expenses relating to the spectrum-repacking. It is expected that the FCC auctions and repacking will involve multiple rule making proceedings and may take several years.   

 Outdoor   

 The outdoor advertising industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S. and to national, regional and local restrictions in foreign countries. These regulations can affect the operation of advertising displays and include restrictions on the construction, repair, operation, upgrading, height, size and location of outdoor advertising structures and, in some instances, the content of advertising copy that can be displayed on these structures. In addition, outdoor advertising is the subject of targeted state and municipal taxes and fees. These laws may affect competitive conditions in various markets in various ways. Such laws may reduce the Company's expansion opportunities, or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from others. No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations and the enforcement thereof will not materially and adversely affect the Outdoor business.  

 Under U.S. law, principally the Highway Beautification Act of 1965 (the "HBA"), outdoor advertising is controlled on primary and interstate highways built with federal financial assistance. As a condition to federal highway assistance, the HBA requires states to restrict billboards on such highways to commercial and industrial areas, and imposes certain additional size, spacing and other requirements associated with the installation and operation of billboards. Outdoor is not aware of any states which have passed laws and adopted regulations which are less restrictive than the federal requirements, including the obligation on the part of the billboard owner to remove, at the owner's expense and without compensation, any non-grandfathered signs on such highways that do not comply with such requirements. Outdoor does not believe that the number of its billboards that may be subject to removal under these regulations is material. No state in which Outdoor operates has banned billboards, but some have adopted standards more restrictive than the federal requirements. Municipal and county governments generally also have sign controls as part of their zoning laws and building codes. Some state and local governments prohibit construction of new billboards and some allow new construction only to replace existing structures, although most allow construction of billboards subject to restrictions on zoning, size, spacing, height and type of construction. In some cases, the construction of new billboards or the relocation or modification of existing billboards is prohibited. A number of cities including New York City, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Miami have implemented or initiated legislative billboard controls, including imposing taxes, fees and/or registration requirements in an effort to decrease or restrict the number of outdoor signs and/or to raise revenue. The Company contests such laws and regulations that it believes unlawfully restrict its constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of its outdoor advertising business.  

 U.S. law neither requires nor prohibits removal of existing lawful billboards, but it does require payment of compensation if a state or political subdivision compels the removal of a lawful billboard along a primary or interstate highway that was built with federal financial assistance. State governments have purchased and removed legal billboards for beautification objectives in the past using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, and may do so in the future. State government authorities from time to time use the power of eminent domain to remove billboards. Thus far, Outdoor has been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for its billboards purchased or removed as a result of this type of governmental action, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future. Local governments do not generally purchase billboards for beautification, but some have attempted to force removal of legal but nonconforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable zoning regulations when built but which do not conform to current zoning regulations) after a period of years under a concept called amortization. Under this concept the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over time. Although there is some question as to the legality of amortization under federal and many state laws, amortization has been upheld in some instances. Outdoor generally has been successful in negotiating settlements with  

I-21 

municipalities for billboards required to be removed. Restrictive regulations also limit Outdoor's ability to rebuild or replace nonconforming billboards.  

 As the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities in outdoor advertising operations, the Company must comply with various U.S. federal, state and local and foreign environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations. The Company and its properties are subject to such laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and employee health and safety, as well as zoning and other land use restrictions which may affect, among other things, the type of display, such as digital, tri-vision or static, the hours of operation and illumination as well as methods and conditions of maintenance of facilities and advertising installation. Historically, the Company has not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws. However, future laws or a finding of a violation of or liability under existing laws could require the Company to make significant expenditures and otherwise limit or restrict its ability to use or operate some of its displays.  

 Certain products, services and types of displays are or may be targeted by federal, state and local laws and regulations. For example, tobacco products have been banned from outdoor advertising. In addition, state and local governments continue to initiate proposals designed to limit outdoor advertising of alcohol. Legislation regulating alcohol-related advertising due to content-related restrictions could cause a reduction in Outdoor's direct revenue from such advertisements and a simultaneous increase in the available space on the existing inventory of billboards in the outdoor advertising industry.
