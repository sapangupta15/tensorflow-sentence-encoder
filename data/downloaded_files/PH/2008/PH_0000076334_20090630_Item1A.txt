ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.  

The Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risk factors, including, but not limited to those set forth below, any one of which could cause actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. These risk factors should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk factors described below are those that the Company believes are currently the most significant. Additional risk factors not currently known to the Company or that the Company believes are immaterial also may impair the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  

The Company is subject to adverse changes in worldwide economic conditions and volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets.  

The extended deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and the resulting volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers, and on the general economic activity in many of the industries and markets in which the Company and its distributors, customers and suppliers operate. These effects have, among other things, negatively impacted the level of capital expenditures and creditworthiness of the Companys distributors, customers and suppliers, and, therefore, the Companys revenues, operating profits and margins and order rates.  

The Company remains focused on maintaining its financial strength by adjusting its cost structure to reflect changing demand levels, maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing its cash through various initiatives, including workforce reductions, salary freezes and short work weeks. There can be no assurance, however, that that these or any other initiatives or contingency plans implemented by the Company to further control costs will be successful.  

The Company cannot predict the duration or severity of the deterioration in worldwide economic conditions and the resulting volatility in and tightening of the capital and credit markets or if or when conditions will improve. These conditions are highly unpredictable and beyond the Companys control. If these conditions continue for a significant period of time or further deteriorate, however, the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  

The Company is subject to risks relating to its foreign operations.  

In fiscal 2009, approximately 44% of the Companys net sales were derived from customers outside the United States. In addition, many of the Companys manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the United States. The Company expects net sales from foreign markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its total net sales. The Companys foreign operations are subject to risk in addition to those risks of its domestic operations, including:  

       fluctuations in currency exchange rates;  

       limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;  

       transportation delays and interruptions;  

- 10 -  

       political, social and economic instability and disruptions;  

       government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions;  

       the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;  

       import and export controls;  

       labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;  

       the potential for nationalization of enterprises;  

       difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;  

       limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and  

       potentially adverse tax consequences.  

If the Company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding its global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations internationally, the risks could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations or financial condition.  

Demand for and supply of the Companys products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which the Company cannot predict or control, which would adversely affects its results of operations.  

Numerous factors may affect the demand for and supply of the Companys products, including:  

       changes in the market acceptance of its products;  

       increased competition in the markets it serves;  

       declines in the general level of industrial production; or  

       declines in the availability or increases in the prices of raw materials.  

If any of these factors occur, the demand for and supply of the Companys products could suffer, which would adversely affect its results of operations.  

The Company operates in a highly competitive environment.  

The Companys domestic and foreign operations are subject to significant competitive pressures. To compete successfully, the Companys Industrial Segment and Climate & Industrial Controls Segment must excel in terms of product quality and innovation, customer service, manufacturing and distribution capability and price competitiveness and its Aerospace Segment must excel on the basis of technological and engineering capability, quality, delivery and service, and price competitiveness. The financial resources of certain of the Companys competitors may put the Company at a competitive disadvantage.  

The raw materials used in the Companys production processes and by its suppliers of component parts are subject to price and supply fluctuations that could increase its costs of products and adversely affect its results of operations.  

The Companys supply of raw materials for its businesses could be interrupted for a variety of reasons, including availability and pricing. Prices for raw materials necessary for production have fluctuated significantly in the past and significant increases could adversely affect the Companys results of operations and profit margins. Although the Company generally attempts to pass along increased raw   

- 11 -  

 material prices to its customers in the form of price increases, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the Companys ability to increase the price of its products, or the Company may be unable to increase the prices of its products due to pricing pressure or other factors.  

The Companys suppliers of component parts may significantly and quickly increase their prices in response to increases in costs of raw materials that they use to manufacture the component parts. As a result, the Company may not be able to increase its prices commensurately with its increased costs. Consequently, the Companys results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.  

The Company may face limitations on its ability to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.  

The Company expects to continue its strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services that it believes will enhance its operations and profitability. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase or that it will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms.  

In addition, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to integrate successfully any business that it purchases into its existing business or that any acquired businesses will be profitable. The successful integration of new businesses depends on the Companys ability to manage these new businesses and cut excess costs. If the Company is unable to complete the integration of new businesses in a timely and effective manner, its results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.  

Potential product liability risks exist from the products that the Company sells.  

The Companys businesses expose it to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of its products and the products of third-party vendors that it uses or resells. Although the Company currently maintains what it believes to be suitable and adequate product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maintain its insurance on acceptable terms or that its insurance will provide adequate protection against all potential liabilities. In the event of a claim against it, a lack of sufficient insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Moreover, even if the Company maintains adequate insurance, a successful claim could still have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.  

The Companys future growth is partly dependent on the development of new products and technologies.  

The markets the Company operates in are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. The Companys ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect its competitive position and often requires the investment of significant resources. Difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new products and services or failure to gain market acceptance of new products and technologies may significantly reduce future revenues and adversely affect the Companys competitive position.  

- 12 -  

The Companys future growth is partly dependent on the preservation of its intellectual property.  

Protecting the Companys intellectual property is critical to its innovation efforts. The Company owns a number of patents, trademarks and licenses related to its products and has exclusive and non-exclusive rights under patents owned by others. The Companys intellectual property may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or the Company may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. In addition, the global nature of the Companys business could present increased risks that the Companys intellectual property will be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use outside of the United States. In such case, the Companys ability to protect its intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are undeveloped or do not recognize or protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. Unauthorized use of the Companys intellectual property rights or inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could adversely impact the Companys competitive position and results of operations.  

The Company may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations to which it is subject.  

The Companys operations necessitate the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, it is subject to various United States federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as foreign laws, designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damages and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or the exposure to, hazardous materials. Among other laws, the Company is subject to the United States federal Superfund law, under which it has been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for clean-up costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the United States Environmental Protection Agencys Superfund priority list. The Company could incur substantial costs as a result of non-compliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws, including the Superfund law.  

The Company may be subject to more stringent environmental laws in the future. If more stringent environmental laws are enacted in the future, these laws could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition.  

The Company may be adversely affected by litigation or other regulatory proceedings.  

The Company is a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory proceedings relating to its business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, the Company cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could adversely impact the Companys business, financial condition or results of operations.  

- 13 -  

The Company does business with the United States government and as such is subject to government regulations.   

In addition to normal business risks, doing business with the United States government subjects the Company to unusual risks, including dependence on the level of government spending and compliance with and changes in governmental procurement regulations. Agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification, either at the convenience of the government or for the Companys failure to perform under the applicable contract. The Company is subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If the Company were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.  

Changes in the Companys tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect profitability.  

The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Companys effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets or tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by United States federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-United States authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to the Companys tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.  

Increasing costs of certain employee and retiree benefits could adversely affect the Companys results of operations.  

The amount of expenses recorded for the Companys defined benefit pension plans is dependent on changes in market interest rates and the value of plan assets, which are dependent on actual plan asset returns. Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets may adversely impact the Companys future results of operations.

The Company believes that its restructuring efforts have brought capacity levels closer to present and anticipated needs. Most of the Companys manufacturing facilities remain capable of handling additional volume increases.  

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings. Parker ITR S.r.l. (Parker ITR), a subsidiary acquired on January 31, 2002, has been the subject of a number of lawsuits and regulatory investigations since April 27, 2007, when a grand jury in the Southern District of Florida issued a subpoena to Parker ITR and the Company requiring the production of documents, in particular documents related to communications with competitors and customers related to Parker ITRs business unit that manufactures marine hose, typically used in oil transfer. The lawsuits and investigations relate to allegations that for a period of up to 21 years, the Parker ITR business unit that manufactures and sells marine hose conspired with competitors in unreasonable restraint of trade to artificially raise, fix, maintain or stabilize prices, rig bids and allocate markets and customers for marine oil and gas hose in the United States and in other jurisdictions.  

On May 15, 2007, the European Commission issued its initial Request for Information to the Company and Parker ITR. On August 2, 2007, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) requested that Parker ITR submit a report to the JFTC on specific topics related to its investigation of marine hose suppliers. Brazilian competition authorities and Korean competition authorities commenced their investigations on November 14, 2007 and January 17, 2008, respectively. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) filed a statement of claim in the Federal Court of Australia on May 29, 2009 and named Parker ITR as a respondent. Parker ITR and the Company have cooperated with all of the regulatory authorities investigating the activities of the Parker ITR business unit that manufactures and sells marine hose and continue to cooperate with the investigations that remain ongoing.  

In addition, during this time period, four class action lawsuits were filed in the Southern District of Florida: Shipyard Supply LLC v. Bridgestone Corporation, et al., filed May 17, 2007; Expro Gulf Limited v. Bridgestone Corporation, et al., filed June 6, 2007; Bayside Rubber & Products, Inc. v. Trelleborg Industrie S.A., et al., filed June 25, 2007; Bayside Rubber & Products, Inc. v. Caleca, et al., filed July 12, 2007; and one in the Southern District of New York: Weeks Marine, Inc. v. Bridgestone Corporation, et al., filed July 27, 2007. On September 12, 2008, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated class action complaint. Plaintiffs have since filed another amended consolidated complaint naming prior owners of the Parker ITR business unit that manufactures and sells marine hose. Plaintiffs generally seek treble damages, a permanent injunction, attorneys fees, and pre-judgment and post-judgment interest.  

The time period for the alleged illegal activities by Parker ITRs marine hose business unit varies by jurisdiction. In the United States, the Department of Justice, which initiated the April 2007 grand jury subpoenas, alleges that the challenged activities commenced in the United States in 1999 and ended May 2, 2007. The Department of Justices investigation is ongoing and the Company and Parker ITR continue to cooperate.  

- 19 -  

In Brazil, Parker ITR filed a procedural defense in January 2008. The Brazilian competition authorities have not yet responded to Parker ITRs filing. The Brazilian competition authorities investigation is ongoing and the Company and Parker ITR continue to cooperate. The Brazilian authorities appear to be investigating the period from 1999 through May 2007. Because the Brazilian competition authorities have not yet responded to Parker ITRs initial filing, the potential outcome of this investigation is uncertain and will depend on the resolution of numerous issues not yet addressed at the current preliminary stage of the investigation.  

In Korea, the Korean Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) submitted several questionnaires to Parker ITR in connection with their investigation of Parker ITRs marine hose bidding activities in Korea from 1999 to May 2, 2007. Parker ITR responded to each questionnaire and continues to cooperate with the KFTC. The KFTC issued its final report on July 2, 2009, which imposed a fine of KRW 42 million (which, as of July 31, 2009, was approximately $34 thousand) on Parker ITR. Parker ITR must pay the fine on or before September 8, 2009.  

The JFTC completed its investigation and issued an administrative order requiring Parker ITR to take certain actions, including passing a board resolution that prohibited the challenged conduct in the future and to send letters to Parker ITRs customers and competitors in Japan stating that Parker ITR would not engage in the challenged conduct in Japan in the future. Parker ITR has complied with the JFTC administrative order.  

On January 28, 2009, the European Commission announced the results of its investigation of the alleged cartel activities. As part of its decision, the European Commission found that Parker ITR infringed Article 81 of the European Commission treaty from April 1986 to May 2, 2007 and fined Parker ITR 25.61 million euros. The European Commission also determined that the Company was jointly and severally responsible for 8.32 million euros of the total fine which related to the period from January 2002, when the Company acquired Parker ITR, to May 2, 2007, when the cartel activities ceased. Parker ITR and the Company filed an appeal to the Court of First Instance of the European Communities on April 10, 2009.  

Counsel for Parker ITR accepted service related to the ACCCs statement of claim. A hearing was held in the matter on July 7, 2009. The matter was continued until certain other respondents are served. The ACCC appears to be investigating conduct for the period beginning as early as 1994 through 2007.  

The Company and Parker ITR have reached a settlement of the class action litigation in the United States, which is subject to court approval. On February 17, 2009, Parker ITR entered into a separate agreement to settle possible private causes of action outside the United States.  

ITEM 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders. None.
