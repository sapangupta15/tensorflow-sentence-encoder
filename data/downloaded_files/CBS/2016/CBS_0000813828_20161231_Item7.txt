Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Management’s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “CBS Corp.”) should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.

Overview

Business overview and strategy

The Company operates businesses which span the media and entertainment industries, including the CBS Television Network, cable networks, content production and distribution, television stations, internet-based businesses, and consumer publishing. The Company’s principal strategy is to create and acquire premium content that is widely accepted by audiences and generate both advertising and non-advertising revenues from the distribution of this content on multiple media platforms and to various geographic locations. The Company continues to increase its investment in both Company-owned and acquired premium content to enhance its opportunities for revenue growth, which include exhibiting the Company’s content on multiple digital platforms, including the Company’s owned digital streaming services as well as third-party live television streaming offerings; expanding the distribution of its content internationally; and securing compensation from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network. The Company also seeks to grow its advertising revenues by monetizing all content viewership as industry measurements evolve to reflect viewers’ changing habits. The Company’s continued ability to capitalize on these and other emerging opportunities will provide it with incremental advertising and non-advertising revenues.

CBS Radio Separation

On February 2, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Entercom Communications Corp. to combine the Company’s radio business, CBS Radio, with Entercom in a merger to be effected through a Reverse Morris Trust transaction, which is expected to be tax-free to CBS Corp. and its stockholders. In connection with this transaction, the Company intends to split-off CBS Radio through an exchange offer, in which the Company’s stockholders may elect to exchange shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock for shares of CBS Radio, which will then be immediately converted into shares of Entercom common stock at the time of the merger. This transaction is subject to customary approvals and closing conditions. The Company expects to complete the transaction during the second half of 2017. CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

Operational highlights 2016 vs. 2015 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) See pages II-6 and II-7 for reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

For 2016, revenues increased 4% to $13.17 billion, led by the broadcast of Super Bowl 50 on CBS, growth in affiliate and subscription fees and higher political advertising sales. These increases were partially offset by the benefit to 2015 from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Manny Pacquiao boxing event, and lower content licensing and distribution revenues compared with 2015, which included significant licensing sales of NCIS and Elementary. 

Operating income decreased 1% from 2015. Comparability of operating income was impacted by discrete items, which for 2016 included charges for a pension settlement and restructuring activities, and for 2015 included gains from the sales of internet businesses in China and restructuring charges. On an adjusted basis, operating income was up 12% driven by the increase in revenues. Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), which included the previously mentioned discrete items as well as impairment charges at CBS Radio, which have been presented in discontinued operations, was $2.81 for 2016 compared with $2.89 for 2015. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $4.11, up 24% from $3.31 for 2015, driven by the higher adjusted operating income and lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company’s $3.0 billion of share repurchases during 2016. The Company believes that presenting its financial results adjusted for the impact of discrete items is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by the Company’s management and provides a clearer perspective on the underlying performance of the Company. These adjusted results are non-GAAP financial measures. See pages II-6 and II-7 for details of the discrete items excluded from adjusted results, along with reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.

The Company generated operating cash flow from continuing operations of $1.45 billion in 2016 and $1.19 billion in 2015. Free cash flow for 2016 was $1.26 billion compared with $1.02 billion for 2015. These increases were driven by growth in affiliate and subscription fees and higher advertising revenues, including from the broadcast of Super Bowl 50 on CBS, partially offset by increased investment in content. The Company generated operating cash flow from discontinued operations of $231 million in 2016 and $205 million in 2015. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Free Cash Flow” on pages II-30 and II-31 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.

Pension Settlement 

In September 2016, the Company offered eligible former employees who had not yet initiated pension benefit payments the option to make a one-time election to receive the present value of their pension benefits as a lump-sum distribution or to commence an immediate monthly annuity benefit. As a result, the Company recorded a one-time pension settlement charge of $211 million in 2016.

Segments

CBS Corp. operates in the following four segments:

ENTERTAINMENT: The Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Studios International, CBS Television Distribution, CBS Interactive and CBS Films as well as the Company’s digital streaming services, CBS All Access and CBSN. Entertainment’s revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, the licensing and distribution of its content, and affiliate and subscription fees. The Entertainment segment contributed 67% to consolidated revenues in each of the years 2016 and 2015, and 66% in 2014, and 53%, 51% and 50% to total segment operating income in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

CABLE NETWORKS: The Cable Networks segment consists of Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks. Cable Networks’ revenues are generated primarily from affiliate and subscription fees and the licensing and distribution of its content. The Cable Networks segment contributed 16%, 18% and 17% to consolidated revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and 33% to total segment operating income in 2016 and 37% in each of the years 2015 and 2014.

PUBLISHING: The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster’s consumer book publishing business with imprints such as Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner and Atria Books. Publishing generates revenues from the distribution of consumer books in print, digital and audio formats. The Publishing segment contributed 6% to consolidated revenues in each of the years 2016, 2015, and 2014, and 4% to total segment operating income in each of the years 2016, 2015, and 2014.

LOCAL MEDIA: The Local Media segment consists of CBS Television Stations and CBS Local Digital Media, with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales and retransmission fees. The Local Media segment contributed 14%, 12% and 13% to consolidated revenues in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and 22%, 19%, and 20% to total segment operating income in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Consolidated Results of Operations—2016 vs. 2015 

Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Advertising

For 2016, the 8% increase in advertising revenues was driven by CBS’s broadcast of the Super Bowl, which is broadcast on the CBS Television Network once every three years through 2022 under the current contract; higher political advertising sales; and 3% growth in underlying network advertising. The increase in network advertising reflects higher pricing, including from increased demand, partially offset by lower ratings, including from the broadcast of NFL games. 

In 2017, the advertising revenue comparison will be negatively affected by the benefit in 2016 from the broadcast of the Super Bowl on CBS and strong political advertising spending. However, advertising revenues in 2017 will benefit from the CBS Television Network’s broadcast of the National Semifinals and National Championship games 

II-8

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

of the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship (“NCAA Tournament”), which are broadcast on the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreements with the NCAA and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (“Turner”). The CBS Television Network’s upfront advertising sales (“Upfront”) for the 2016/2017 television broadcast season, which runs from the middle of September 2016 through the middle of September 2017, resulted in pricing increases compared with the prior broadcast season, which is expected to benefit advertising revenues during the 2016/2017 broadcast season (See page I-2 for a description of the Upfront market). However, overall advertising revenues for the Company will be dependent on ratings for its programming and market conditions, including demand in the scatter advertising market, which is when advertisers purchase the remaining advertising spots closer to the broadcast of the related programming.

Content licensing and distribution

Content licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally produced television programming; fees from the distribution of third party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. For 2016, the 6% decrease in content licensing and distribution revenues primarily reflected lower domestic television licensing revenues compared with 2015, which included the sales of NCIS, Elementary and CSI. A significant contributor to television licensing revenues in 2016 was the international licensing of five Star Trek series.

Content licensing and distribution revenue comparisons are impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of Company-owned television series for multiyear licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition. Unrecognized revenues attributable to license agreements for produced programming that is not yet available for exhibition were $749 million and $847 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of the end of 2016, the Company had approximately 500 episodes of scripted original programming that had not yet been made available in the secondary domestic marketplace (See page II-51 for a description of the secondary marketplace).

Total outstanding receivables attributable to revenues recognized under licensing agreements at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $3.82 billion and $3.83 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2016, the total amount due from these receivables was $1.63 billion in 2017, $1.03 billion in 2018, $595 million in 2019, $349 million in 2020, and $216 million in 2021 and thereafter. 

Affiliate and subscription fees

Affiliate and subscription fees are principally comprised of revenues received from MVPDs for carriage of the Company’s cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”), as well as for authorizing the MVPDs’ carriage of the Company’s owned television stations (“retransmission fees”); fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“station affiliation fees”); subscription fees for digital streaming services; and revenues received for the distribution of pay-per-view boxing events. For 2016, the 9% increase in affiliate and subscription fees reflects 35% growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission fees, and revenues from the Company’s streaming subscription services, including CBS All Access and the Showtime digital streaming subscription offering. These increases were partially offset by the benefit to 2015 from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Manny Pacquiao boxing event, which was the highest grossing pay-per-view event of all time. 

Over the next few years, the Company expects to benefit from the renewal of several of its agreements with station affiliates and MVPDs as well as from agreements with new distributors of live television streaming offerings. In addition, the Company’s existing agreements with station affiliates and MVPDs include annual contractual increases. Together, these factors are expected to result in continued growth in affiliate and subscription fees over the next several years.

International Revenues

International revenues primarily consist of television licensing revenues. The Company generated approximately 14% and 16% of its total revenues from international regions in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Programming expenses reflect the amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the television broadcast and cable networks, and television stations. For 2016, the 2% increase in programming expenses was primarily driven by increased sports programming costs associated with the broadcast of NFL games, including Super Bowl 50, which was broadcast by CBS in 2016, partially offset by three fewer Thursday Night Football games than 2015. This increase was partially offset by costs in 2015 associated with Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Manny Pacquiao pay-per-view boxing event and lower costs for acquired television series as a result of a shift to a higher mix of internally developed television series.

Production expenses reflect the amortization of direct costs of internally developed television and theatrical film content as well as other television production costs, including on-air talent. For 2016, the 2% increase in production expenses reflected increased investment in internally developed television series, partially offset by lower expenses associated with the decrease in television licensing revenues. 

Participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily include participation and residual expenses for television programming, royalty costs for Publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to television content, such as print and advertising. For 2016, the 5% decrease in participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily reflected lower participations associated with lower licensing sales of the CSI franchise.

Other operating expenses primarily include compensation and costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support. The 8% increase in SG&A primarily reflects incremental advertising, marketing and employee-related costs to support the Company’s growth initiatives, and higher pension and incentive compensation costs.

Depreciation and Amortization

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2016, the 4% decrease in depreciation and amortization was the result of intangibles and property and equipment that became fully amortized, and the sales of internet businesses in China.

Pension Settlement Charge

In September 2016, the Company offered eligible former employees who had not yet initiated pension benefit payments the option to make a one-time election to receive the present value of their pension benefits as a lump-sum distribution or to commence an immediate monthly annuity benefit. As a result, the Company paid a total of $518 million of lump-sum distributions in 2016 using its pension plan assets, representing 12% of the total obligations of its qualified pension plans. Accordingly, the Company recorded a one-time settlement charge of $211 million, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. 

Restructuring and Merger and Acquisition-Related Costs

During the year ended December 31, 2016, in a continued effort to reduce its cost structure, the Company initiated restructuring plans across several of its businesses, primarily for the reorganization of certain business operations. As a result, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $30 million, reflecting $19 million of severance costs and $11 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. These restructuring activities are expected to reduce the Company’s annual cost structure by approximately $30 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $45 million, reflecting $24 million of severance costs and $21 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $19 million, reflecting $11 million of severance costs and $8 million of costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. 

As of December 31, 2016, the cumulative settlements for the 2016, 2015, and 2014 restructuring charges were $55 million, of which $33 million was for severance costs and $22 million related to costs associated with exiting contractual obligations. The Company expects to substantially utilize its restructuring reserves by the end of 2018.

Provision for Income Taxes

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. The Company’s income tax provision for 2016 included a one-time benefit of $47 million associated with a multiyear adjustment to a tax deduction, which was approved by the IRS during the third quarter of 2016, and a tax benefit of $81 million related to the pension settlement charge of $211 million. In 2015, the Company’s income tax provision included a tax provision of $8 million related to gains from the sales of internet businesses in China of $139 million. 

Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net earnings from continuing operations for 2016 was comparable with 2015, as the increase in revenues was offset by the 2016 pension settlement charge of $211 million ($130 million, net of tax), and 2015 gains on the sales of internet businesses in China of $139 million ($131 million, net of tax). The 9% increase in diluted EPS from continuing operations was driven by lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company’s share repurchases during 2016, which totaled $3.0 billion.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The results of CBS Radio for 2016 included a pretax noncash impairment charge of $444 million ($427 million, net of tax) to reduce the carrying value of CBS Radio’s goodwill and FCC licenses in 11 markets to their fair value and for 2015, included a pretax noncash impairment charge of $484 million ($297 million, net of tax) to reduce the carrying value of radio FCC licenses in 18 markets to their fair value. 

For 2016, net loss from discontinued operations also included a charge of $36 million from the resolution of a tax matter in a foreign jurisdiction relating to a previously disposed business that was accounted for as a discontinued operation. For 2015, net loss from discontinued operations also included a decrease to the guarantee liability associated with the 2013 disposition of the Company’s outdoor advertising business in Europe (“Outdoor Europe”) as a result of a reduction to the risk associated with the guarantee. 

CBS Radio Indebtedness

In October 2016, in connection with the Company’s previously announced plans to separate its radio business, CBS Radio borrowed $1.46 billion through a $1.06 billion senior secured term loan due 2023 (“Term Loan”) and the

issuance of $400 million of 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2024 through a private placement. During the fourth quarter of 2016, CBS Radio prepaid $100 million of the Term Loan, leaving $960 million outstanding at December 31, 2016. The Term Loan is part of a credit agreement which also includes a $250 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Radio Revolving Credit Facility”) which expires in 2021. At December 31, 2016, the total outstanding borrowing under the Radio Revolving Credit Facility was $10 million. This debt is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of CBS Radio. The Company does not guarantee, or otherwise provide credit support for, the senior notes, Term Loan, or Radio Revolving Credit Facility. 

Net Earnings and Diluted EPS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Consolidated Results of Operations— 2015 vs. 2014 

Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Advertising

For 2015, the 2% decrease in advertising revenues was principally driven by lower local advertising revenues, mainly from the benefit to 2014 from midterm elections. These declines were partially offset by growth in network advertising revenues, which increased 1% despite the broadcast of fewer sporting events on the CBS Television Network in 2015. The increase in network advertising reflects higher scatter pricing in the second half of the year, primarily as a result of increased demand. The increase is also driven by more inventory available to be sold at higher prices in the scatter market as a result of fewer units sold in the Upfront for the 2015/2016 season compared with the 2014/2015 season.

Content licensing and distribution

For 2015, the 2% decrease in content licensing and distribution revenues reflects lower domestic television licensing revenues, partially offset by higher international television licensing revenues. Significant contributors to domestic licensing revenues in 2015 included Elementary and NCIS, while 2014 included Blue Bloods, Hawaii Five-0, and Dexter.

Affiliate and subscription fees

For 2015, the 15% increase in affiliate and subscription fees reflects 43% growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission fees; higher cable affiliate fees from growth in rates; higher revenues from pay-per-view boxing events as 2015 included the Floyd Mayweather/Manny Pacquiao boxing event, which was the highest grossing pay-per-view event of all time; and revenues from new streaming subscription services.

For 2015, the 14% increase in production expenses reflects an increased investment in internally developed television series as well as higher costs associated with the mix of titles sold under television licensing agreements in 2015 compared with 2014. The Company produced approximately 20% more hours of original scripted programming in 2015 compared with 2014.

For 2015, the 6% decrease in participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily reflects lower participations and residuals associated with the decrease in licensing revenues.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2015, the 35% increase in net earnings from continuing operations and the 55% increase in diluted EPS from continuing operations was driven by a 2014 loss on early extinguishment of debt of $352 million ($219 million, net of tax) and 2015 gains from the sales of internet businesses in China of $139 million ($131 million, net of tax). The diluted EPS comparison also benefited from lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of the Company’s ongoing share repurchase program and the split-off of Outdoor Americas during 2014.

In December 2014, the Company completed a radio station swap with Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. through which the Company exchanged 13 of its radio stations in Tampa and Charlotte as well as one radio station in Philadelphia, for two radio stations in Philadelphia and three radio stations in Miami. In connection with the radio station swap, the Company recorded a pretax noncash impairment charge of $52 million to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill. 

Net Earnings and Diluted EPS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2014, included in net earnings is the gain of $1.56 billion, or $2.78 per diluted share, on the disposal of Outdoor Americas. 

Segment Results of Operations - 2016 vs. 2015 

In preparation for the planned separation of its radio business, the Company changed the manner in which it manages its television and radio operations during the third quarter of 2016. Accordingly, the Company began presenting Local Media, which was previously combined with CBS Radio in the Local Broadcasting segment, as a separate operating segment. In connection with the new segment presentation, the presentation of intercompany revenues was revised, including station affiliation fees paid by Local Media to the CBS Television Network. In addition, CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation of the Company. Results for all periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. 

The Company presents operating income (loss) excluding a pension settlement charge, restructuring and merger and acquisition-related costs, and other operating items, net, each where applicable, (“Segment Operating Income”) as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments (“segment profit measure”) in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment Operating Income is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company’s management and enhances their ability to understand the Company’s operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to the Company’s consolidated Net earnings is presented in Note 17 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements.

2016 vs. 2015 

For 2016, the 5% increase in revenues was primarily driven by 10% growth in network advertising revenues, mainly from the broadcast of Super Bowl 50 on CBS in 2016 and 3% growth in underlying network advertising revenues. Affiliate and subscription fees grew 45% as a result of higher station affiliation fees and subscription growth for CBS All Access. These increases were partially offset by 7% lower content licensing and distribution revenues compared to 2015, which included significant licensing sales of NCIS, Elementary and CSI, while 2016 benefited from the international licensing of five Star Trek series. The revenue comparison was also impacted by the sales of internet businesses in China.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The increase in operating income of 17% primarily reflects the increase in revenues. For 2016 and 2015, restructuring charges primarily reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs.

In 2017, the revenue comparison will be negatively affected by the benefit to 2016 from the broadcast of the Super Bowl, which will also air on the CBS Television Network in 2019 and 2022 under the current contract. Revenues in 2017 will benefit from the CBS Television Network’s broadcast of the National Semifinals and National Championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which are broadcast on the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreements with the NCAA and Turner. In addition, results in 2017 are expected to benefit from continued growth in affiliate and subscription fee revenues, driven by the renewal of several of the Company’s agreements with its television station affiliates and annual contractual increases on multiyear agreements with television station affiliates. Revenue comparisons will also be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of availability of television series for multiyear licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition.

2016 vs. 2015

For 2016, the 4% decrease in revenues was a result of the benefit in 2015 from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Manny Pacquiao boxing event, which was the highest grossing pay-per-view event of all time. The decrease in pay-per-view revenues negatively impacted the revenue comparison by seven percentage points. In addition, content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 8% from 2015, reflecting the timing of multiyear agreements for the international licensing of Showtime original series, partially offset by the domestic licensing sale of Penny Dreadful in 2016. Higher revenues from the Showtime digital streaming subscription offering partially offset these declines. As of December 31, 2016, subscriptions totaled approximately 76 million for Showtime Networks (including Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix), 55 million for CBS Sports Network and 32 million for Smithsonian Networks.

Operating income increased 1% driven by contributions from the Showtime digital streaming subscription offering, partially offset by lower television licensing revenues. Restructuring charges in 2016 primarily reflected severance costs.

Revenue comparisons in 2017 may be impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of availability of television series for multiyear licensing agreements. Television license fee revenues are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition.

2016 vs. 2015

For 2016, the 2% decrease in revenues reflects lower digital book sales, partially offset by growth in digital audio sales. Digital sales represented 23% of Publishing’s total revenues for 2016. Best-selling titles for 2016 included Born to Run by Bruce Springsteen, End of Watch by Stephen King and A Man Called Ove by Fredrik Backman. 

The 4% increase in operating income mainly resulted from lower production, inventory and selling costs. For 2016, restructuring charges primarily reflected severance costs.

2016 vs. 2015

For 2016, the 12% increase in revenues was led by higher political advertising sales in 2016 as a result of U.S. federal and state elections, 14% growth in retransmission and subscription revenues, and the broadcast of Super Bowl 50 on CBS during the first quarter of 2016.

The increase in operating income of 27% primarily reflects the revenue growth. For 2016 and 2015, restructuring charges reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting contractual obligations and other related costs.

In 2017, the revenue comparison will be negatively affected by the benefit in 2016 from strong political advertising associated with U.S. federal and state elections and the broadcast of the Super Bowl, which will also air on the CBS Television Network in 2019 and 2022 under the current contract. Results in 2017 are expected to benefit from continued growth in retransmission revenues, driven by the renewal of several of the Company’s agreements with MVPDs and annual contractual increases on multiyear agreements with MVPDs.

2015 vs. 2014 

For 2015, the 2% increase in revenues was primarily driven by 47% growth in affiliate and subscription fees. Network advertising revenues increased 1%, despite the broadcast of fewer sporting events on the CBS Television Network in 2015, reflecting higher scatter pricing in the second half of the year, primarily as a result of increased demand. The increase is also driven by more inventory available to be sold at higher prices in the scatter market as a result of fewer units sold in the Upfront for the 2015/2016 broadcast season, compared with the 2014/2015 season. Overall advertising revenues for the Entertainment segment remained flat as the increase in network advertising revenues was offset by the impact from the sale of an internet business in China during the first quarter of 2015. Content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 3% reflecting lower domestic television licensing revenues, which were partially offset by higher international television licensing revenues. Significant contributors to domestic television licensing revenues in 2015 included Elementary and NCIS, while 2014 included Blue Bloods, Hawaii Five-0 and Criminal Minds. 

The decrease in operating income of 2% was primarily driven by increased investment in programming and digital distribution initiatives. For 2015 and 2014, restructuring charges primarily reflected severance costs and costs associated with exiting operating facilities.

2015 vs. 2014 

For 2015, the 3% increase in revenues was primarily driven by higher revenues from new long-term agreements for the international licensing of Showtime original series; pay-per-view boxing events; and affiliates, as well as revenues from new digital distribution initiatives. These increases were offset by lower domestic licensing revenues as 2014 benefited from significant domestic streaming sales of Dexter. As of December 31, 2015, subscriptions totaled approximately 77 million for Showtime Networks (including Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix), 55 million for CBS Sports Network and 33 million for Smithsonian Networks.

Operating income decreased 3% as the revenue growth was more than offset by higher costs associated with the increased pay-per-view boxing revenues and the mix of titles sold under television licensing arrangements. 

During 2015, the Company launched its digital streaming subscription offering of Showtime that is available on showtime.com and through the Showtime app on multiple platforms. Subscribers to this offering have on-demand access to Showtime original series, theatrical feature films, documentaries and sports-related programming, as well as the live east and west coast linear feeds of Showtime.

Cash Flows 

The changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities. In 2016, the increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was primarily driven by growth in affiliate and subscription fees and higher advertising revenues, including from the broadcast of Super Bowl 50, partially offset by increased investment in programming and higher payments for income taxes. 

In 2015, the increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations resulted from early-redemption premiums paid in 2014 in connection with the Company’s debt refinancing, with no comparable amount in 2015, and lower payments for income taxes, mainly resulting from federal tax refunds received in 2015. These increases were partially offset by increased investment in programming.

Cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations primarily reflected the operating activities of CBS Radio. For 2016 and 2015, operating activities from discontinued operations also included payments for tax matters in foreign jurisdictions related to previously disposed businesses that are accounted for as discontinued operations. For 2014, cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations also reflected cash flows relating to Outdoor Americas and Outdoor Europe. 

Cash paid for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increase in cash paid for income taxes for 2016 was driven by higher taxable income and a higher tax benefit in 2015 from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock units. Cash taxes from continuing operations benefited from federal income tax refunds of $90 million in 2016, $169 million in 2015 and $25 million in 2014. Cash taxes for 2016 also included a one-time benefit of $47 million associated with a multiyear adjustment to a tax deduction, which was approved by the IRS during the third quarter of 2016.

(e) 2014 principally reflects the disposition of Outdoor Americas’ cash. 

Financing Activities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free Cash Flow

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects the Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations and including capital expenditures. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company’s operations. The Company’s net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company’s ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company’s operating performance. The Company believes the presentation 

II-30

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company’s underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by the Company’s investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of the Company’s operating performance to other companies in its industry. 

As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions that are not reflected in free cash flow.

The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company’s net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Dividends

On July 28, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 20% increase to the quarterly cash dividend on its Class A and Class B Common Stock to $.18 from $.15 per share. 

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company declared total per share dividends of $.66, $.60, and $.54, respectively, which resulted in total annual dividends of $294 million, $293 million and $296 million, respectively. 

On January 26, 2017, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $.18 per share on its Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2017. 

Share Repurchase Program

On July 28, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an increase to the Company’s share repurchase program to a total availability of $6.0 billion. During 2016, the Company repurchased 54.3 million shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock for $3.0 billion.

Capital Structure

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Long-term debt of $1.35 billion at December 31, 2016 is included in discontinued operations on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements).

During July 2016, the Company issued $700 million of 2.90% senior notes due 2027. 

During January 2016, the Company repaid its $200 million of outstanding 7.625% senior debentures upon maturity.

For the year ended December 31, 2015, debt issuances were as follows:

January 2015, $600 million 3.50% senior notes due 2025 

January 2015, $600 million 4.60% senior notes due 2045 

July 2015, $800 million 4.00% senior notes due 2026 

The Company used the net proceeds from the 2016 and 2015 issuances for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock and repayment of short-term borrowings, including commercial paper.

At December 31, 2016, the Company classified $399 million of debt maturing in July 2017 as long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, reflecting its intent and ability to refinance this debt on a long-term basis. 

At December 31, 2016, the Company’s scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding capital leases, were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Commercial Paper

At December 31, 2016 the Company had $450 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings under its $2.5 billion commercial paper program, at a weighted average interest rate of 0.98% and with remaining maturities of less than 45 days. There were no outstanding commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2015.

Credit Facility

During June 2016, the Company amended and restated its $2.5 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). The amended Credit Facility expires in June 2021 and contains provisions that are substantially similar to 

II-32

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

the previous credit facility, which was due to expire in December 2019. The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the Company’s option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or LIBOR plus a margin based on the Company’s senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments.

The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.5x at the end of each quarter as further described in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2016, the Company’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 2.9x.

The Consolidated Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of the Company’s indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the Company’s Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other noncash items.

The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2016, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $2.49 billion.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company’s operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, operating leases, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. The Company’s investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which had $2.49 billion of remaining availability at December 31, 2016, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.

The Company’s funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. The Company routinely assesses its capital structure and opportunistically enters into transactions to lower its interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.

Funding for the Company’s long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of $2.10 billion is expected to come from the Company’s ability to refinance its debt and cash generated from operating activities.

At December 31, 2016, the Company had $4.11 billion of remaining availability under its share repurchase program. Share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt.

Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2016 payments due by period under the Company’s significant contractual obligations, excluding obligations of discontinued operations, with remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include $8.06 billion for sports programming rights, $2.26 billion relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, and $758 million for talent contracts.

(b) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.

(c) Consists of long-term noncancellable operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders and studio facilities.

(d) Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, excluding capital leases.

(e) Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases.

(f) Includes capital leases for satellite transponders.

(g) Reflects long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, including program liabilities, participations due to producers and residuals.

The table above excludes $102 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and timing of cash payments relating to this obligation. 

In January 2017, the Company made discretionary contributions of $100 million to pre-fund its qualified pension plans. In 2017, the Company expects to make contributions of approximately $54 million to its non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2017, the Company expects to contribute approximately $50 million to its other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy the Company’s portion of benefit payments due under these plans. 

Guarantees

The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2016, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $103 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.

The Company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Programming and Production Costs

Accounting for the Company’s television production costs requires management’s judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs. For each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs.

The costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and the costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. The economic benefit is determined based on management’s estimates of revenues to be derived from the programming. Management’s judgment is required in determining the value of the future economic benefit and timing of the expensing of these costs.

Ultimate revenue estimates for internally produced television programming, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, which includes television series, feature films and sports, are updated regularly based on information available as the television program or film progresses through its life cycle or contractual term. Overestimating Ultimate Revenues for internally produced programming or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and/or estimated accruals for participation expense.

Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

The Company performs a fair value-based impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised of FCC licenses, annually during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company’s reporting units are one level below its operating segments, except for the Publishing reporting unit, which is the same as its operating segment because this operating segment has only one component. FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. The Company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of 

II-35

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

all of the Company’s radio or television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2016 the Company had 11 reporting units and FCC license book values for stations in 14 television markets and 25 radio markets. 

In preparation for the planned separation of its radio business, the Company changed the manner in which it manages its television and radio operations during the third quarter of 2016. Accordingly, the Company’s previously reported operating segment, Local Broadcasting, which had been comprised of two reporting units, was separated into two operating segments, Local Media and Radio, each with three reporting units. The Company allocated goodwill to each of the new reporting units based on their relative fair values. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, the former Radio operating segment has been presented as a discontinued operation. See Note 4 for discussion of impairment tests for the three reporting units and FCC licenses under the former Radio operating segment.

Television FCC Licenses— For its annual impairment test, the Company performs qualitative assessments for each market that management estimates has an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. In selecting markets for a qualitative assessment the Company also considers the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2016 annual impairment test, the Company performed qualitative assessments for 3 television markets. For each of these markets, the Company weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for advertising revenue and operating costs, as well as market share and capital expenditures. The Company also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the Company concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

For FCC licenses in the remaining television markets, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test that compares the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses by geographic market with their respective carrying values. The estimated fair value of each FCC license is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method (‘‘Greenfield Method’’), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start-up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall advertising revenues in the relevant geographic market, the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, and a three-year build-up period for the start-up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. The overall market advertising revenue in the subject market is estimated based on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are estimated based on both industry and internal data. The residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation in the U.S. and long-term industry projections. The discount rate is determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities in the broadcast industry. The discount rates and perpetual nominal growth rates used for each television station for 2016 were 8.0% and 2.5%, respectively.

For the 11 television markets for which a quantitative test was performed in 2016, the Company concluded that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in each market exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was necessary. The estimated fair value of one television market, which had a carrying value of FCC licenses of $74 million, exceeded its carrying value by 9%. In each of the remaining television markets, the estimated fair value of FCC licenses was in excess of the respective carrying values by more than 10%.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which the Company owns and operates television stations. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, or a decline in the local television advertising marketplace could result in a downward revision to the Company’s current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in any local television advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of the local television advertising revenues; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a noncash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Goodwill—For its annual impairment test, the Company performs qualitative assessments for each reporting unit that management estimates have fair values that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. For the 2016 annual impairment test, the Company performed qualitative assessments for seven reporting units. For each of these reporting units, the Company weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, the Company considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. The Company also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, the Company concluded that for these seven reporting units, it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount and therefore performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.

For 2016, the Company performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for the CBS Sports Network reporting unit. The first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows (“Discounted Cash Flow Method”) and the traded or transaction values of comparable businesses (“Market Comparable Method”). The Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method resulted in similar estimated fair values. The Discounted Cash Flow Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on the Company’s internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and long-term industry projections and for 2016 was 2.0%. The discount rate was determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities and for 2016 was 9.0%.

For the 2016 annual impairment test the Company concluded that the estimated fair value of the CBS Sports Network reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and therefore the second step of the impairment test was unnecessary. The estimated fair value of the CBS Sports Network reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.

Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market, a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; and/or changes in consumer behavior could result in changes to the Company’s assumptions and judgments used in its goodwill impairment tests. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and noncash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Reserves and Legal Matters

Estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims.

Pensions

Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet the Company’s pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2016, the unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income decreased from the prior year end due primarily to a lump-sum distribution offered to plan participants which accelerated recognition of unamortized losses in the plan, as well as the favorable performance of pension plan assets. These events were offset by a decrease in the discount rate. A decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate will result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $113 million and would not have a material impact on 2017 pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $8 million to 2017 pension expense.

Income Taxes

The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording the worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold

a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $102 million at December 31, 2016 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.

Legal Matters 

General. On an ongoing basis, the Company vigorously defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, ‘‘litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against the Company without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.

Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company’s products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had pending approximately 33,610 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 36,030 as of December 31, 2015 and 41,100 as of December 31, 2014. During 2016, the Company received approximately 4,160 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 6,580 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. In 2016, the Company’s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance and taxes were approximately $48 million. In 2015, as the result of an insurance settlement, insurance recoveries exceeded the Company’s after tax costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims by approximately $5 million. The Company’s costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic

claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has remained generally flat in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company’s estimate of its asbestos liabilities.

Other. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.

Market Risk

The Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and uses derivative financial instruments to modify this exposure. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Risk

The Company conducts business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.

At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $433 million and $291 million, respectively, which represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows.

Interest Risk

All of the Company’s long-term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements. During 2014, in connection with the issuance of its $600 million of 2.30% senior notes due 2019, the Company entered into $600 million notional amount of fixed-to-floating rate swap agreements to hedge this debt. During 2015, prior to maturity, the Company settled these interest rate swaps and received $12 million in cash, plus accrued interest. The resulting increase in the carrying value of the previously hedged debt is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the debt. The Company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015 but in the future may use derivatives to modify its exposure to interest rates.

Credit Risk

The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

The Company’s receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2016 or 2015, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company’s products and services are sold.
