ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand McCormick & Company, Incorporated, our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. We use certain non-GAAP information that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. The dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the MD&A are in millions, except per share data.

McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We manage our business in two operating segments, consumer and industrial, as described in Item 1 of this report.

Our long-term annual growth objectives are to increase sales 4% to 6%, increase operating income 7% to 9% and increase earnings per share 9% to 11%. Over time, we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from: 1) our base business–driven by brand marketing support, customer intimacy and category growth; 2) product innovation; and 3) acquisitions. We are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program, an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization as well as savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements. In addition to funding brand marketing support, product innovation and other growth initiatives, our CCI program helps offset higher material costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share. 

Our business generates strong cash flow, and we have a balanced use of cash. We are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends, with annual increases in each of the past 30 years, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases. Each year, we expect a combination of acquisitions and share repurchases to add about 2% to earnings per share growth.

In 2015, we continued to grow our business, although sales and earnings were unfavorably impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar and the resultant unfavorable effects of foreign currency exchange, as compared to 2014. Net sales rose 1% over the 2014 level, as a result of the following factors:

•We grew volume and product mix, with similar increases in both our consumer and industrial segments. This added 4% of sales growth. The increases were driven by product innovation, brand marketing and expanded distribution including new retail channels and new geographic regions. 

•Three acquisitions were completed in 2015, adding 1% of the increase in net sales. 

•Pricing actions to offset a mid-single digit increase in material cost inflation added 1% of the increase in net sales. 

•These increases were offset by unfavorable currency rates. This impact reduced the net sales growth rate by 5%. 

Operating income was $548.4 million in 2015 and $603.0 million in 2014. Excluding special charges, adjusted operating income rose to $613.9 million from $608.2 million in 2014 or an increase of 1%. As with net sales, unfavorable currency exchange lowered this growth rate, with an impact of 4%. For further details and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to reported amounts, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Excluding this impact, the increase in adjusted operating income compared to the prior year would have been 5%. This was below our long-term objective due in part to higher material costs and higher employee benefit expense in 2015 as compared to the 

prior year, as well as an increase in brand marketing. Diluted earnings per share was $3.11 in 2015 and $3.34 in 2014. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned special charges, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.48 in 2015, an increase of 3% over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.37 in 2014. This growth rate reflected the increase in adjusted operating income, higher income from unconsolidated operations and the impact of our share repurchases. The unfavorable currency exchange rates had an adverse impact on the increase in adjusted operating income as previously described, as well as on income from unconsolidated operations.

McCormick continues to generate strong cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities reached $590.0 million in 2015, an increase from $503.6 million in 2014. We continued to have a balanced use of cash for capital expenditures, acquisitions and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In 2015, that return of cash to our shareholders was $350.7 million.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2015 COMPARED TO 2014

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales for the fiscal year 2015 increased by 1.3% from 2014 and included a 5.1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis (that is, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange as more fully described under the caption, Non-GAAP Financial Measures), our sales increased 6.4% over 2014, with growth in both the consumer and industrial segments. Higher volume and product mix added 3.9% to sales, driven by product innovation, brand marketing and expanded distribution including new retail channels and new geographic regions. Pricing actions, taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs, added 1.1% to sales. The incremental impact of the three acquisitions completed in 2015–Brand Aromatics, Drogheria & Alimentari (D&A) and Stubb’s–added 1.4% to sales. 

In 2016, we expect to grow sales on a constant currency basis by 4% to 6% from 2015, driven by further increases in volume and product mix, pricing actions to offset a projected increase in material costs and incremental sales from the acquisitions completed during 2015. We expect this range to be reduced as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange rates.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2015, gross profit was comparable to 2014. Gross profit margin declined 40 basis points from the 2014 level to 40.4%. This decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to the impact of a mid-single digit increase in material costs, partially offset by cost savings and pricing actions. In 2015, CCI cost savings, as well as savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements, totaled $98 million, of which $66 million lowered cost of goods sold. Lower gross profit from our Kohinoor business in India also impacted gross profit margin in 2015, and, as a result, toward the end of 2015 we decided to discontinue the lower margin bulk-packaged and broken rice product lines of our Kohinoor business. In 2016, we expect our pricing actions and cost savings to more than offset an estimated low single-digit increase in raw material and packaging costs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,127.4 million in 2015 compared to $1,122.0 million in 2014, an increase of $5.4 million. SG&A as a percentage of net sales was 26.2%, a 30 basis point reduction from 2014. Driving this reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales were cost savings from CCI and from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 to our financial statements, as well as the benefit of higher sales, partly 

offset by higher benefits expense and a $14 million increase in our brand marketing from the 2014 level to $240.6 million in 2015. In connection with our acquisitions of Brand Aromatics, D&A and Stubb’s, we incurred $3.6 million of transaction costs, which were included in SG&A. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We are evaluating and implementing changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness. Special charges of $65.5 million were recorded in 2015 and $5.2 million in 2014 to enable us to implement these changes. Of the $65.5 million of special charges recorded in 2015, $4.0 million were recorded in cost of goods sold. Of the $65.5 million, $29.2 million related to employee severance and related costs associated with our North American effectiveness initiative, and $24.4 million related to our EMEA reorganization initiated earlier in 2015. An additional $14.2 million related to our Kohinoor consumer business in India. Partially offsetting these charges was a credit of $2.3 million for the 2015 reversal of reserves previously accrued as part of special charges in 2014 and 2013. See note 3 of the financial statements for more details on these charges and our basis for classifying amounts as special charges. 

In 2014, we recorded special charges of $2.1 million related to actions undertaken with respect to the EMEA reorganization announced in late 2013, $1.3 million related to the realignment of certain manufacturing activities in the U.S. industrial business, $1.1 million related to the elimination of certain administrative positions in the U.S. consumer and industrial businesses, and $0.7 million related to the elimination of certain administrative and manufacturing positions in the Australian consumer business.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest expense for 2015 was higher than the prior year, primarily due to higher average borrowings. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effective tax rate increased 20 basis points to 26.5% in 2015, from 26.3% in 2014, primarily as a result of the following factors. Net discrete tax benefits increased by $8.3 million, from $10.8 million in 2014 to $19.1 million in 2015. Both 2015 and 2014 included reversals of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, net of additional taxes provided, for various income tax audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitation in several tax jurisdictions. In addition, 2015 included a net discrete tax benefit for (i) the reversal of valuation allowances on non-U.S. deferred tax assets due to a change in our assessment of the recoverability of those deferred tax assets, and (ii) a prior year adjustment for the 2014 research tax credit related to legislation enacted in 2015, offset by (iii) a discrete tax detriment for the revaluation of deferred tax assets in the U.K. resulting from legislation enacted in 2015 which reduced the U.K. statutory tax rate in future periods. The increase in net discrete tax benefits in 2015, as compared to 2014, was more than offset by an unfavorable mix of earnings in 2015. That unfavorable mix of earnings in 2015, as compared to the prior year, resulted from the higher percentage of U.S. pre-tax earnings in 2015 that are taxed at a federal statutory rate of 35% as well as an increase in non-U.S. losses in jurisdictions where income tax benefits could not be recognized as it is more likely than not that the resultant deferred tax assets will not be realized. See note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate with the effective tax rate.

We expect an effective tax rate in 2016 of approximately 28%.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Income from unconsolidated operations rose $7.3 million in 2015 from the prior year, which was a 24.8% increase, despite the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. This increase is attributable to our largest joint venture, 

McCormick de Mexico, which achieved higher sales and an increase in gross margin percentage. In 2015, our 50% interest in the McCormick de Mexico joint venture represented 60% of the sales and 89% of the income of our unconsolidated operations. We own 50% of most of our other unconsolidated joint ventures. 

In 2016, we expect income from unconsolidated operations to be comparable to 2015, mainly due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates and material costs on McCormick de Mexico.

We reported diluted earnings per share of $3.11 in 2015, compared to $3.34 in 2014. The table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2014 to 2015. The increase in adjusted operating income and increase in income from unconsolidated operations in the table below reflect a significant impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2015. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We measure segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges as these activities are managed separately from the business segments. 

Consumer Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales of our consumer segment increased by 0.4%, which included a 4.9% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, as compared to 2014. On a constant currency basis, consumer sales increased by 5.3% in 2015, due to higher volume and product mix that added 3.8% to sales and higher pricing related to material cost changes that added 0.1% to sales. Our acquisitions of D&A and Stubb’s, during the second and third quarters, respectively, added 1.4% to sales in 2015. 

In the Americas, consumer sales rose 1.8% in 2015 as compared to 2014. That increase included a 1.4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, Americas consumer sales increased by 3.2%, which included 2.4% from higher volume and product mix and 0.5% from higher pricing. Higher volume and product mix was led by U.S. sales growth in spices and seasonings and recipe mixes. This is an improvement over the 2014 sales results and is being driven by product innovation, brand marketing, particularly in digital, and working with retailers on in-store product assortment, pricing and promotion. The acquisition of Stubb’s, which closed in August 2015, added 0.3% to sales in 2015. 

In the EMEA region, consumer sales decreased 5.0% as compared to 2014. However, that decrease included an unfavorable impact of 15.3% from foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, EMEA consumer sales increased by 10.3%, which included 4.7% from higher volume and product mix and 0.3% from higher pricing. The acquisition of D&A, which closed in May 2015, added 5.3% to sales in 2015. Our core business growth in the EMEA region was led by Poland, France and Russia and driven by our higher brand marketing, new product innovation and expanded distribution. 

In the Asia/Pacific region, consumer sales increased 2.6% as compared to 2014. That increase included an unfavorable impact of 4.0% from foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, Asia/Pacific consumer sales increased by 6.6%, which included 8.3% from higher volume and product mix, partly offset by a 1.7% reduction from pricing. In 2015, constant currency sales in both China and Australia increased at a double-digit rate due in part to expanded distribution, while sales in India declined due in part to the discontinuation of lower-margin bulk-packaged and broken rice product lines, as well as lower pricing on basmati rice. 

Operating income, excluding special charges, for our consumer segment decreased $18.2 million, or 3.8%, compared to 2014. On a constant currency basis, operating income for 2015, excluding special charges, decreased 0.4%, with the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings, offset by the unfavorable impact of higher material costs, increased employee benefit expense and a 4% increase in brand marketing. The decrease in operating income led to lower operating income margin. Excluding the impact of special charges, the consumer segment operating income margin was 17.3% in 2015 and 18.1% in 2014.

Industrial Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales of our industrial segment increased by 2.7%, which included a 5.5% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, as compared to 2014. On a constant currency basis, industrial sales increased by 8.2% in 2015, due to higher volume and product mix that added 4.3% to sales and higher pricing related to material cost changes that added 2.6% to sales. Our acquisition of Brand Aromatics in the second quarter added 1.3% to sales in 2015. 

In the Americas, industrial sales rose 3.2% in 2015 as compared to 2014. That increase included a 3.2% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, Americas industrial sales increased by 6.4%, which included 1.3% from higher volume and product mix and 3.1% from higher pricing. Higher volume and product mix was led by sales of snack seasonings in both the U.S. and Mexico, as well as branded food service products in the U.S. The acquisition of Brand Aromatics, which closed in March 2015, added 2.0% to industrial sales in the Americas in 2015. 

In the EMEA region, industrial sales increased 0.8% as compared to 2014. That increase included an unfavorable impact of 11.8% from foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, EMEA industrial sales increased by 12.6%, which included 10.4% from higher volume and product mix and 2.2% from higher pricing. The strong sales performance reflected our support for the growth and geographic expansion of leading quick service restaurants and food manufacturers in this region. 

In the Asia/Pacific region, industrial sales increased 2.9% as compared to 2014. That increase included an unfavorable impact of 7.3% from foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, Asia/Pacific industrial sales increased by 10.2%, which included 9.9% from higher volume and product mix and 0.3% from pricing. In 2015, we increased sales to quick service restaurant customers in China and other markets across this region. 

Operating income, excluding special charges, for our industrial segment increased $23.9 million, or 17.8%, compared to 2014. On a constant currency basis, operating income for 2015, excluding special charges, increased 24.5% above 2014, with the favorable impact of sales growth and cost savings more than offsetting the unfavorable impact of higher material costs and increased employee benefit expense. The significant increase in operating income led to higher operating income margin. Excluding the impact of special charges, the industrial segment 

operating income margin was 9.5% in 2015 and 8.3% in 2014. This also reflects a shift in the business mix to more value-added products, including the acquisition of Brand Aromatics.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2014 COMPARED TO 2013

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales for the fiscal year 2014 increased by 2.9% from 2013 and included a 0.6% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, our sales increased 3.5% over 2013, with growth in both the consumer and industrial segments. Pricing actions, taken in response to increased raw material and packaging costs, added 1.9% to sales. The incremental impact of the Wuhan Asia Pacific Condiments (WAPC) acquisition, completed in mid-2013, accounted for a 1.8% increase to sales, while volume and product mix in the base business reduced sales 0.2%. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2014, gross profit increased 3.9% while gross profit margin rose 40 basis points over the 2013 level to 40.8%. We offset a low single-digit increase in raw material and packaging costs with our pricing actions and CCI cost savings. In 2014, CCI cost savings totaled $65 million, of which $54 million lowered cost of goods sold. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,122.0 million in 2014 compared to $1,075.0 million in 2013, an increase of $47.0 million or 40 basis points as a percentage of net sales. That 40 basis point increase was driven by an $18.8 million increase in our brand marketing support from the 2013 level to $226.6 million in 2014, with 40% of that increase related to digital marketing, which is one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support. In addition, compared to 2013, lower pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in 2014 were partially offset by increased employee incentive compensation expenses in 2014.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Beginning in 2013, we evaluated and implemented changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness. Special charges of $5.2 million, principally related to employee severance and related benefits, were recorded in 2014 to enable us to implement these changes. For 2013, we recorded $25.0 million of special charges, with $15.9 million related to employee severance, $6.4 million for asset write-downs and $2.7 million for other exit costs. See note 3 of the financial statements for additional information.

In addition to the special charges outlined above, we recorded a loss on voluntary pension settlement of $15.3 million in 2013 for the settlement of a portion of our U.S. defined benefit obligation, which reduced the size of our pension obligation and should reduce potential pension volatility in the future. The settlement charge relates to a lump sum distribution elected by certain former U.S. employees in exchange for their deferred vested pension plan benefits. This lump sum payout program was completed in 2013. See note 10 of the financial statements for additional information.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest expense for 2014 was lower than the prior year, primarily due to the refinancing of long-term debt in the second half of 2013. In August 2013, we issued $250 million of 3.50% notes (at an effective interest rate of 3.30%), the net cash proceeds of which, plus cash on hand, were used to pay off $250 million of 5.25% notes (at an effective interest rate of 5.54%) that matured in September 2013. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effective tax rate declined 50 basis points to 26.3% in 2014 from 26.8% in 2013, primarily as a result of the following factors: Discrete tax benefits were $10.8 million in 2014 compared to $3.9 million in 2013. That increase in 2014 is primarily due to the reversal of previously established reserves for unrecognized tax benefits, net of additional taxes provided, upon the following tax settlements reached during 2014: (1) a settlement with respect to the French taxing authority’s audits of the 2007-2013 tax years; and (2) a settlement with respect to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination of our U.S. federal income tax return for the 2007 and 2008 tax years. Discrete tax benefits in 2013 of $3.9 million resulted from the 2013 recognition of a 2012 U.S. research tax credit and reversal of valuation allowances for two subsidiaries originally established against net operating losses. During 2013, a new law was enacted that retroactively granted the research tax credit in 2012 and allowed for a research tax credit in 2013. No research tax credit was recognized in 2014 as the tax law which retroactively granted the research tax credit for 2014 was not enacted until after the company’s 2014 fiscal year end. See note 12 of the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate with the effective tax rate.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Income from unconsolidated operations rose $6.2 million in 2014 compared to 2013, which was a 26.7% increase. This increase was attributable to our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, which benefited in 2014 from its transition to a more efficient manufacturing facility and from lower commodity costs. 

In 2014, our 50% interest in the McCormick de Mexico joint venture represented 64% of the sales and 91% of the net income of our unconsolidated joint ventures. 

We reported diluted earnings per share of $3.34 in 2014, compared to $2.91 in 2013. The following table outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2013 to 2014:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We measure segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement as these activities are managed separately from the business segments. 

Consumer Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales of our consumer segment increased by 3.4%, which included a 0.4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, as compared to 2013. On a constant currency basis, consumer sales increased by 3.8% in 2014, which included a 2.9% increase due to the mid-2013 acquisition of WAPC and a 2.0% increase due to higher pricing, offset in part by a 1.1% decline in volume and product mix in 2014 from 2013.

In the Americas, consumer segment sales declined 0.7% in 2014 as compared to 2013. That decline included a 0.7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, consumer sales in the Americas approximated the prior year level as higher pricing added 1.6% to sales while a decline in volume and product mix reduced sales 1.6%. In the latter part of 2013, our sales growth was hampered as smaller competitors gained category share. This competitive activity persisted in 2014. Throughout 2014, we had actions underway to regain momentum with this part of our business that included additional brand marketing support, accelerated innovation and working with our retail customers to optimize their spices and seasonings and their recipe mix categories while simultaneously increasing sales of our products to these customers. We made progress and gained category share in 2014 in recipe mixes, driven in part by new grilling products, gluten-free products and liquid skillet sauces. In 2014, our category share of spices and seasonings had a further decline.

In EMEA, consumer sales increased 3.3% in 2014 over the 2013 level, with 1.5% added by favorable foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, consumer sales in EMEA increased by 1.8%, as pricing increased sales by 2.0% while volume and product mix declined slightly, reducing sales by 0.2%. While we had success with new product introductions, increased brand marketing and distribution gains, economic conditions across the region remained challenging. In this region, higher brand marketing support was devoted to building awareness and trial of new products, as well as digital marketing.

In 2014, as compared to 2013, consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region rose 31.2%, which included unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates that lowered sales 3.2%. On a constant currency basis, consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased by 34.4%. Our mid-2013 acquisition of WAPC added 28.2% to net sales, pricing actions added 4.0%, and base business volume and product mix added 2.2%. We achieved a double-digit increase in our base business volume and product mix in China. However, crop shortages of basmati rice led to another year of steep increases in cost and pricing of basmati rice in India during 2014, and a subsequent decline in our sales volume as consumers turned toward lower cost rice varieties.

Operating income, excluding special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement for our consumer segment rose 0.4% to $474.3 million from $472.3 million in 2013. On a constant currency basis, operating income, excluding special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement, for our consumer segment increased 1.1% in 2014 over the prior year level. Higher sales and CCI cost savings contributed to this profit growth, but were partly offset by higher material costs and a $16.8 million increase in brand marketing support. Operating income margin, excluding the impact of special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement, was 18.1% in 2014 compared to 18.6% in 2013. This reduction was due, in part, to the higher brand marketing support and the mix of business across regions, as sales in international markets grew at a faster rate than in the U.S., where our profit margin is higher due to larger scale and less complexity. 

Industrial Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales of our industrial segment increased by 2.0%, which included a 0.7% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates, as compared to 2013. On a constant currency basis, industrial sales increased by 2.7% in 2014, as pricing actions taken to offset the impact of higher material costs added 1.8% and volume and product mix added 0.9%. The growth in volume and product mix was led by sales of snack seasonings in the Americas and sales to quick service restaurants in our EMEA region.

In the Americas, industrial sales rose 0.4%, which included a 0.9% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, industrial sales in the Americas rose by 1.3% over 2013, as pricing added 1.0% and volume and product mix added 0.3%. Innovation and category growth drove increased sales of seasonings for snack products and we also grew sales of branded foodservice items in 2014. However, demand from quick service restaurants was weak in the U.S. in 2014.

In EMEA, we grew industrial sales 9.3%, which included a 1.1% favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, industrial sales in EMEA increased by 8.2% over the prior year, with a 5.0% increase from pricing actions and a 3.2% increase in volume and product mix. Demand from quick service restaurants remained robust, and we met this demand with products that we supply from our facilities in the U.K., Turkey and South Africa.

In the Asia/Pacific region, industrial sales declined by 0.5% from the 2013 level. That decline included a 2.4% unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, industrial sales in the Asia/Pacific region rose by 1.9% in 2014, as pricing actions added 1.0% and higher volume and product mix added 0.9%. Sales to quick service restaurants in China were adversely impacted by consumer concerns regarding quality issues from a supplier of protein in 2014 and regarding avian flu in 2013.

Operating income, excluding special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement for our industrial segment, was $133.9 million in 2014, compared to $118.5 million in 2013. On a constant currency basis, operating income, excluding special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement, for our industrial segment increased 13.4% in 2014, as compared to the prior year. The increase from higher sales, the benefit of CCI cost savings and a more favorable mix of business, was partly offset by increased material costs and a $2.0 million increase in marketing support for branded foodservice items. Industrial segment operating income margin, excluding the impact of special charges and the 2013 loss on voluntary pension settlement, was 8.3% in 2014 compared to 7.5% in 2013.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The tables below include financial measures of adjusted operating income, adjusted income from unconsolidated operations, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, each excluding the impact of special charges in 2015, 2014 and 2013, and loss on voluntary pension settlement in 2013. These represent non-GAAP financial measures, which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. In our consolidated income statement, we include a separate line item captioned “special charges” in arriving at our consolidated operating income. Additionally, we recorded $4.0 million in cost of goods sold in our income statement for the twelve months ended November 30, 2015 which we classified as special charges. Special charges consist of expenses, including related impairment 

charges, associated with certain actions undertaken by the company to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee, comprised of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; President and Chief Operating Officer; Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; President Global Industrial Segment and McCormick International; President Global Consumer Segment and North America; and Senior Vice President, Human Relations. Upon presentation of any such proposed action (including details with respect to estimated costs, which generally consist principally of employee severance and related benefits, together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a non-cash component, such as an asset impairment, or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold; impacted employees or operations; expected timing; and expected savings) to the Management Committee and the Committee’s advance approval, expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on-going basis through completion. Details with respect to the composition of special charges recorded for the periods and in the amounts set forth below are included in note 3 of the accompanying financial statements.

We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends.

Special charges of $65.5 million were recorded in 2015 to enable us to implement changes to our organization structure in order to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness. Of the $65.5 million of special charges recorded in 2015, $29.2 million related to our North American effectiveness initiative, $24.4 million related to streamlining actions in our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, and $14.2 million related to our Kohinoor business in India. Partially offsetting these charges was a reduction of $2.3 million associated with the 2015 reversal of reserves previously accrued as part of actions undertaken in 2013 and 2014.

In 2014 we recorded special charges of $5.2 million. Of the $5.2 million of special charges recorded in 2014, $2.1 million related to actions undertaken with respect to the EMEA reorganization announced in 2013, $1.3 million related to the realignment of manufacturing activities in the U.S. industrial business, and $1.1 million and $0.7 million related to the elimination of administrative and/or manufacturing positions in the consumer and industrial businesses in the U.S. and Australia, respectively.

In 2013, we recorded $25.0 million of special charges related to reorganization activities in the EMEA region and $15.3 million of loss on voluntary pension settlement related to our U.S. pension plan for a lump sum distribution to former employees in exchange for their deferred vested pension plan benefits.

We are treating these special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement as adjustments to our operating income, income from unconsolidated operations, net income and diluted earnings per share. We are providing non-GAAP results that exclude the impact of these special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement as it allows for a better comparison of 2015 financial results to 2014 and 2013. See notes 3 and 10 of the financial statements for additional information on the special charges and the loss on voluntary pension settlement, respectively.

These non-GAAP measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP financial results is provided below.

(1) Represents the portion of the Kohinoor total special charge of $14.2 million attributable to Kohinoor's 15% minority stakeholder.

(2) Total special charges of $65.5 million for 2015 and $5.2 million for 2014 are net of taxes of $15.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Total special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement for 2013 of $40.3 million are net of taxes of $11.1 million.

Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year. The tables set forth below present constant currency net sales and operating income growth as follows: (1) to present constant currency net sales and operating income growth for 2015, net sales and operating income for the year ended November 30, 2015 for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for the year ended November 30, 2014 and compared to the reported results for the year ended November 30, 2014; and (2) to present constant currency net sales and operating income growth for 2014, net sales and operating income for the year ended November 30, 2014 for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for year ended November 30, 2013 and compared to the reported results for the year ended November 30, 2013.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In addition to the above non-GAAP measures, we use total debt to adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA) as a measure of leverage. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income plus expenses of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, special charges and loss on voluntary pension settlement. Adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA are both non-GAAP financial measures. This ratio measures our ability to repay outstanding debt obligations. Our target for total debt to adjusted EBITDA is 1.5 to 1.8. Our total debt to adjusted EBITDA can be temporarily impacted by our acquisition activity. We believe that total debt to adjusted EBITDA is a meaningful metric to investors in evaluating our financial leverage and may be different than the method used by other companies to calculate total debt to adjusted EBITDA. 

 The following table reconciles our adjusted EBITDA to our net income:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We generate strong cash flow from operations which enables us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives, increase our dividend, fund capital projects and make share repurchases when appropriate. In 2016, we expect to continue our share repurchase activity and fund all or a portion of possible future acquisitions with cash flow from operations.

In the cash flow statement, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as these do not reflect actual cash flows. Accordingly, the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet.

The reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods. At November 30, 2015, the exchange rate for substantially all foreign currencies, including the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Australian dollar and Chinese renminbi were lower versus the U.S. dollar than at November 30, 2014. 

Operating Cash Flow – Operating cash flow was $590.0 million in 2015, $503.6 million in 2014 and $465.2 million in 2013. The variability in cash flow from operations in 2015 compared to 2014 and 2013 is primarily attributable to improvements in the three main components of working capital. The change in accounts payable was a source of cash in 2015, compared to a use of cash in 2014 and a modest source of cash in 2013. The change in accounts receivable was also a source of cash in 2015, but a use of cash in 2014 and 2013. The change in inventory also had an impact on the variability in cash flow from operations, as it was a less significant use of cash in 2015 when compared to 2014 and 2013. Dividends received from unconsolidated affiliates were higher in 2015 when compared to 2014 and 2013 as well as in 2014 when compared to 2013, contributing to the increased cash flow from operations in 2015 and 2014. Higher adjusted net income, in 2015 compared to 2014 and in 2014 compared to 2013, contributed $7.9 million and $23.4 million to net cash flow from operating activities in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

In addition to operating cash flow, we also use cash conversion cycle (CCC) to measure our working capital management. This metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures. CCC is a calculation of the number of days, on average, that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources, such as raw materials, to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable. Our goal is to lower our CCC over time. We calculate CCC as follows:

Days sales outstanding (average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales) plus days in inventory (average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold) less days payable outstanding (average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory).

The following table outlines our cash conversion cycle (in days) over the last three years:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in CCC in 2015 from 2014 is mainly due to a decrease in our days sales outstanding resulting from new contractual terms with a strategic customer. The increase in CCC in 2014 from 2013 is mainly due to an increase in our days in inventory as a result of increased strategic raw material inventory. 

Investing Cash Flow – Net cash used in investing activities was $338.9 million in 2015, $131.6 million in 2014 and $239.7 million in 2013. The variability between years is principally a result of cash usage related to our acquisitions of businesses, which amounted to $210.9 million in 2015 and $142.3 million in 2013. We did not make any acquisitions in 2014. See note 2 of the financial statements for further details related to the 2015 and 2013 acquisitions. Capital expenditures were $128.4 million in 2015, $132.7 million in 2014 and $99.9 million in 2013. We expect 2016 capital expenditures to range between $150 million and $160 million. 

Financing Cash Flow – Net cash used in financing activities was $199.6 million in 2015, $348.9 million in 2014 and $245.9 million in 2013. The variability between years is principally a result of share repurchase and dividend activity, described below, and of changes in our net borrowing activity. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, our net borrowing activity provided cash of $118.0 million, $56.1 million and $66.7 million, respectively. In 2015, we received net cash proceeds of $246.5 million from our issuance of $250 million of 3.25% notes due 2025. The net proceeds from this offering were used to pay down short-term borrowings and for general corporate purposes. In December 2015, proceeds from short-term borrowings were used to pay off $200 million of 5.20% notes that matured in December 2015. In 2013, we received net cash proceeds of $246.2 million from our issuance of $250 million of 3.50% notes due 2023. We used these net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay $250 million of maturing 5.25% notes and $1.4 million of other long-term debt, and we increased our net short-term borrowings by $71.9 million in 2013.

The following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of November 30, 2015, $570 million remained of a $600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our Board of Directors in March 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we completed a previous $400 million share repurchase program that had been authorized in April 2013. 

The common stock issued in 2015, 2014 and 2013 relates to our stock compensation plans.

Our dividend history over the past three years is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In November 2015, the Board of Directors approved a 7.5% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.40 to $0.43 per share. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The increase in our total debt to adjusted EBITDA from 2014 to 2015 is mainly due to higher long-term debt borrowings in 2015 to fund our acquisitions of Brand Aromatics, D&A and Stubb’s. Excluding the impact of special charges, adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was $755.6 million and the ratio of total debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.85. The 

increase in our total debt to adjusted EBITDA from 2013 to 2014 is mainly due to higher short-term borrowings to fund strategic purchases of inventory.

Most of our cash is in our foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations, capital projects and future acquisitions. At November 30, 2015, we temporarily used $171.7 million of cash from our foreign subsidiaries to pay down short-term debt in the U.S. The average short-term borrowings outstanding for the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014 were $546.0 million and $423.7 million, respectively. The total average debt outstanding for the years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014 was $1,571.9 million and $1,428.7 million, respectively.

During the year ended November 30, 2015, we entered into a total of $100 million of forward starting interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of fixed rate notes in November 2015. We cash settled all of these agreements, which were designated as cash flow hedges, for a loss of $1.2 million simultaneous with the issuance of the notes at an all-in effective fixed rate of 3.45% on the full $250 million of debt. The loss on these agreements is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized to increase interest expense over the life of the notes. Hedge ineffectiveness of these agreements is not material.

In November 2015, we entered into an interest rate swap contract for a notional amount of $100 million to receive interest at 3.25% and pay a variable rate of interest based on three-month LIBOR plus 1.22%. We designated these swaps, which expire in November 2025, as fair value hedges of the changes in fair value of $100 million of the $250 million 3.25% medium-term notes due 2025 that we issued in November 2015. Any unrealized gain or loss on these swaps will be offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in the value of the hedged debt. Hedge ineffectiveness of these agreements is not material.

In November 2012 and in April and August 2013, we entered into a total of $175 million of forward-starting interest rate swap and Treasury rate lock agreements to manage our interest rate risk associated with the anticipated issuance of fixed rate notes in August 2013. We cash settled all of these agreements, which were designated as cash flow hedges, for a gain of $9.0 million simultaneous with the issuance of the notes at an all-in effective fixed rate of 3.30% on the full $250 million of debt. The gain on these agreements is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized to reduce interest expense over the life of the notes. Hedge ineffectiveness of these agreements is not material.

See notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements for further details of these transactions.

Credit and Capital Markets – The following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business:

CREDIT FACILITIES – Cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth, share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. We also rely on our revolving credit facility, or borrowings backed by this facility, to fund seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate requirements. 

In June 2015, we entered into a five-year $750 million revolving credit facility which will expire in June 2020. The pricing for this credit facility, on a fully drawn basis, is LIBOR plus 0.75%. This credit facility replaces our $600 million revolving credit facility which was due to expire in June 2016. We generally use this facility to support our issuance of commercial paper. If the commercial paper market is not available or viable, we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility. The facility is made available by a syndicate of banks, with various commitments per bank. If any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital. In addition to our committed revolving credit facility, we have uncommitted credit facilities for $154.0 million as of November 30, 2015 that will expire in 2016. We engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our credit facilities. During these communications, none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. In addition, we periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities, we believe our banks will perform on their commitments. See also note 6 of the financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements. We believe that our internally generated funds and the existing sources of liquidity under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund ongoing operations.

PENSION ASSETS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS – We hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan. Cash payments to pension plans, including unfunded plans, were $15.7 million in 2015, $16.8 million in 2014 and $42.7 million in 2013. It is expected that the 2016 total pension plan contributions will be approximately $16 million primarily for international plans. Future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets. We base our investment of plan assets, in part, on the duration of each plan’s liabilities. Across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans, approximately 64% of assets are invested in equities, 26% in fixed income investments and 10% in other investments. Assets in the rabbi trust are primarily invested in corporate-owned life insurance, the value of which approximates an investment mix of 50% in equities and 50% in fixed income investments. See also note 10 of the financial statements, which provides details on our pension funding.

CUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES – See the subsequent section of this discussion under Market Risk Sensitivity–Credit Risk.

ACQUISITIONS

Acquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits. 

In 2015, we made the following acquisitions:

•We purchased 100% of the shares of Brand Aromatics, a privately held company located in the U.S. Brand Aromatics is a supplier of natural savory flavors, marinades, and broth and stock concentrates to the packaged food industry. Its addition expands the breadth of value-added products in our industrial segment. The purchase price for Brand Aromatics was $62.4 million, net of post-closing adjustments and was financed with a combination of cash and short-term borrowings. Brand Aromatics has been included in our industrial segment since its acquisition.

•We purchased 100% of the shares of Drogheria & Alimentari (D&A), a privately held company based in Italy, and a leader of the spice and seasoning category in Italy that supplies both branded and private label products to consumers. The purchase price for D&A consisted of a cash payment of $49.0 million, net of cash acquired of $2.8 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, and was financed with a combination of cash and short-term borrowings. In addition, the purchase agreement calls for a potential earn out payment in 2018 of up to €35 million, based upon the performance of the acquired business in 2017. D&A has been included in our consumer segment since its acquisition.

•We purchased 100% of the shares of One World Foods, Inc., owner of the Stubb's brand of barbeque products (Stubb's), a privately held company located in Austin, Texas. Stubb's is the leading premium barbeque sauce brand in the U.S. In addition to sauces, Stubb's products include marinades, rubs and skillet sauces. Its addition will expand the breadth of value-added products in our consumer segment. The purchase price for Stubb's was $99.4 million, subject to certain closing adjustments, and was financed with a combination of cash and short-term borrowings. Stubb's has been included in our consumer segment since its acquisition.

See note 2 of the financial statements for further details regarding these acquisitions.

PERFORMANCE GRAPH—SHAREHOLDER RETURN

The following line graph compares the yearly change in McCormick’s cumulative total shareholder return (stock price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends) on McCormick’s Non-Voting Common Stock with (1) the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Price Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends, and (2) the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor’s Packaged Foods & Meats Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends.

MARKET RISK SENSITIVITY

We utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument. The use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 7 of the financial statements.

Foreign Exchange Risk – We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas: cash flows related to raw material purchases; the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars; the value of foreign currency investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and cash flows related to repatriation of these investments. Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Polish zloty, Australian dollar, Mexican peso, Chinese renminbi, Indian rupee, Thai baht and Swiss franc, as well as the British pound sterling versus the Euro. We routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks.

During 2015, the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in France, the U.K., Poland, Canada and Australia. We did not hedge our net investments in subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates.

The following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at November 30, 2015. All contracts are valued in U.S. dollars using year-end 2015 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures, firm commitments or anticipated transactions.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AT NOVEMBER 30, 2015

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We have a number of smaller contracts at November 30, 2015 with an aggregate notional value of $14.8 million to purchase or sell other currencies, such as the Swiss franc and the Thai baht. The aggregate fair value of these contracts was $0.2 million at November 30, 2015.

Included in the table are $140.1 million notional value of contracts that have durations of less than seven days that are used to hedge short-term cash flow funding. Remaining contracts have durations of one to 12 months.

At November 30, 2014, we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Polish zloty with a notional value of $262.7 million, all of which matured in 2015. The aggregate fair value of these contracts was $3.5 million at November 30, 2014.

Interest Rate Risk – Our policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates, excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees, by fiscal year of maturity at November 30, 2015. For foreign currency-denominated debt, the information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents. Variable interest rates are based on the weighted-average rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented.

YEAR OF MATURITY AT NOVEMBER 30, 2015

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The table above displays the debt by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value, interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees. Interest rate swaps have the following effects. The fixed interest rate on $100 million of the 5.20% notes due in December 2015 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2015. Net interest payments were based on 3 month LIBOR minus 0.05% during this period. We issued $250 million of 5.75% notes due in December 2017 in December 2007. Forward treasury lock agreements of $150 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full $250 million of notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 6.25%. We issued $250 million of 3.90% notes due in 2021 in July 2011. Forward treasury lock agreements of $200 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full $250 million of notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 4.01%. We issued $250 million of 3.50% notes due in 2023 in August 2013. Forward treasury lock agreements of $175 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full $250 million of notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.30%. We issued $250 million of 3.25% notes due in 2025 in November 2015. Forward treasury lock agreements of $100 million were settled upon the issuance of these notes and effectively fixed the interest rate on the full $250 million of notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.45%. The fixed interest rate on $100 million of the 3.25% notes due in December 2025 is effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2025. Net interest payments are based on 3 month LIBOR plus 1.22% during this period. 

Commodity Risk – We purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions, growing and harvesting conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. In 2015, our most significant raw materials were pepper, dairy products, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), rice, onion, wheat flour and garlic. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future 

delivery and customer price adjustments. We generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. To the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose, it has not been material to our business.

Credit Risk – The customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers. Consolidations in these industries have created larger customers. In addition, competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers, dollar stores, warehouse clubs, discount chains and e-commerce. This has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. We continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties. We feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value. We consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

The following table reflects a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of November 30, 2015:

CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS DUE BY YEAR

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)The contingent consideration liability outstanding as of November 30, 2015 represents the estimated fair value of a contractual earn out provision associated with our acquisition of D&A. As more fully described in note 2 of the financial statements, the D&A purchase agreement calls for a potential earn out payment in 2018 of up to €35 million, based upon the performance of the acquired business in 2017. Changes in the fair value of this liability, including any increase or decrease to our estimate of the ultimate payout, determined under the contractual provisions, and accretion of interest on the discounted liability, will occur prior to the ultimate payment in 2018.

(b)Raw material purchase obligations outstanding as of year-end may not be indicative of outstanding obligations throughout the year due to our response to varying raw material cycles.

(c)Other purchase obligations primarily consist of advertising media commitments and electricity contracts.

Pension and postretirement funding can vary significantly each year due to changes in legislation, our significant assumptions and investment return on plan assets. As a result, we have not presented pension and postretirement funding in the table above.

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS EXPIRATION BY YEAR

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of November 30, 2015 and 2014.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

New accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations. See note 1 of the financial statements for further details of these impacts.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

In preparing the financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosed by us, including information about contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe, given current facts and circumstances, our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to U.S. GAAP and are consistently applied. Inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. In preparing the financial statements, we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets and prepaid allowances. Our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas:

Customer Contracts

In several of our major geographic markets, the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multi-year customer contracts. These contracts include provisions for items such as sales discounts, marketing allowances and performance incentives. These items are recognized based on certain estimated criteria such as sales volume of indirect customers, customers reaching anticipated volume thresholds and marketing spending. We routinely review these criteria and make adjustments as facts and circumstances change.

Goodwill and Intangible Asset Valuation

We review the carrying value of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below. We also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.

Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates.

Goodwill Impairment

Our reporting units are the same as our operating segments. We calculate fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model. Our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using our internal cost of capital as the discount rate. We then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including intangible assets and goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value, then we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. An impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value. As of November 30, 2015, we had $1,759.3 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet ($1,587.7 million in the consumer segment and $171.6 million in the industrial segment). Our testing indicates that the current fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of carrying values. Accordingly we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.

Indefinite-lived Intangible Asset Impairment

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks. We calculate fair value by using a relief-from-royalty method or discounted cash flow model and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.

In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded special charges related to initiatives to improve the profitability of our Kohinoor consumer business in India. This action principally relates to the discontinuance of Kohinoor's non-profitable bulk-packaged and broken basmati rice product lines and other ancillary activities to enable the business to focus on both its existing consumer-packaged basmati rice product lines and the launch of consumer-packaged herbs and spices under the Kohinoor brand name. 

In light of the anticipated sales reduction associated with Kohinoor's discontinuance of its bulk-packaged and broken basmati rice product lines, only partially offset by the launch of consumer-packaged herbs and spices, we determined that an impairment of the Kohinoor brand name had occurred. Using a relief from royalty method (and a discount rate reflective of the risk associated with the launch of consumer-packaged herbs and spices), a level 3 fair value measurement, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $9.6 million to write down the carrying value of our Kohinoor brand name to its estimated fair value of $8.3 million. See note 3 of our financial statements for additional information on this impairment charge.

As of November 30, 2015, we had $281.2 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet and none of the balances exceed their calculated fair values. Excluding the Kohinoor brand name that was written down to its estimated fair value in the third quarter of 2015 and the brand names associated with Brand Aromatics, Drogheria & Alimentari and Stubb's that were recorded at fair value upon acquisition in fiscal 2015, the percentage excess of calculated fair value over book value of our major brand names and trademarks ranges from a low of 40% to a high of over 90%. 

Below is a table which outlines the book value of our major brand names and trademarks as of November 30, 2015:

Income Taxes

We estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return. At the end of each year, an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements. Tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year. A reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time which will result in changes to the original estimate. We believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported, but tax authorities may challenge certain positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. We believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions, including related interest, is adequate. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. We have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In doing so, we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

Pension and other postretirement plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. The actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results. A 1% increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2016 pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately $16 million. A 1% increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2016 pension expense by approximately $8 million. 

Assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our pension plan is a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and therefore the amount of expense we will recognize. 

During 2014, the Society of Actuaries released a series of updated mortality tables resulting from recent studies conducted by them measuring mortality rates for various groups of individuals and mortality information from the Social Security Administration through 2009. The updated mortality tables released by the Society of Actuaries in 2014 reflected improved trends in longevity and would, therefore, have had the effect of increasing the estimate of benefits to be received by plan participants. During 2015, the Society of Actuaries released a series of updated mortality tables that reflected updated Social Security Administration data from 2010 and 2011 and that reflected smaller improvements in longevity than its 2014 mortality tables. 

In determining the most appropriate mortality assumptions for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans at November 30, 2014, we considered the updated mortality tables issued by the Society of Actuaries in 2014, coupled with other mortality information available from the Social Security Administration (including the 2010 and 2011 data previously referenced) and from our consulting actuaries that we believe is more closely aligned with our industry and participant mix to develop assumptions that we believe are most representative of the various characteristics of our participant populations. Our use of these updated mortality assumptions during 2014 increased the benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by approximately $18 million at November 30, 2014 and increased related pension and other postretirement benefit expense by approximately $2 million in 2015. Based on our evaluation as of November 30, 2015, in conjunction with advice from our consulting actuaries, we determined that no further change was required to our mortality assumptions in 2015, other than the following refinement with respect to our U.S. other postretirement benefit plan. In determining the most appropriate mortality assumptions for our U.S. other postretirement benefit plan at November 30, 2015, we modified those mortality assumptions to reflect a headcount-weighted version of such assumptions that we believe is most representative of the characteristics of our other postretirement benefits population. The effect of this modification decreased the benefit obligation for our U.S. other postretirement benefit plan by approximately $1.7 million and will have an immaterial effect on our related 2016 expense.

We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of mortality and other assumptions used in the measurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. In addition, see note 10 of the financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements.

Stock-Based Compensation

We estimate the fair value of our stock-based compensation using fair value pricing models which require the use of significant assumptions for expected volatility of stock, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate. Our valuation methodology and significant assumptions used are disclosed in note 11 of the financial statements.
