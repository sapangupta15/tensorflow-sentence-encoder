Item 7 —Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (‘SEC’). We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically underlying and organic non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company’s operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future.

Underlying total revenues, underlying total expenses, underlying salaries and benefits, underlying other operating expenses, underlying operating income, underlying operating margin, underlying EBITDA, underlying net income and underlying earnings per diluted share (hereinafter referred to collectively as the ‘underlying measures’) are calculated by excluding the impact of certain items and period over period movements in foreign currency, from the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 

Organic commissions and fees, total revenues, organic total expenses, organic salaries and benefits, organic other operating expenses, organic operating income, organic operating margin and organic EBITDA (hereinafter referred to collectively as the ‘organic measures’) further adjust underlying measures to exclude the twelve month impact from acquisitions and disposals from the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.

This discussion includes forward-looking statements, including under the headings ‘Executive Summary’, ‘Review of consolidated results’, ‘Liquidity and Capital Resources’, and ‘Critical Accounting Estimates’. Please see ‘Forward-Looking Statements’ for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in those statements.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Business Overview

Willis Towers Watson is a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. With roots dating to 1828, Willis Towers Watson has approximately 39,000 employees in more than 120 countries. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. Our unique perspective allows us to see the critical intersections between talent, assets and ideas - the dynamic formula that drives business performance.

We bring together professionals from around the world - experts in their areas of specialty - to deliver the perspectives that give organizations a clear path forward. We do this by offering risk management, insurance broking, consulting, technology and solutions and private exchanges.

In our capacity as a consultant, technology and solutions, and private exchange company we help our clients enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees. We focus on delivering consulting services that help organizations anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management as well as investment advice to help our clients develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals. We operate the largest private Medicare exchange in the United States. Through this exchange, we help our clients move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with retiree healthcare benefits.

In our capacity as risk advisor and insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk, and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network. We also offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks. These services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting) as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We are not an insurance company and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account.

For additional information regarding our business, see the more detailed discussion under Part I, Item 1 - ‘Business’ of this Form 10-K. 

Towers Watson Merger

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Towers Watson & Co. with Towers Watson & Co. continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis on January 4, 2016. 

Immediately following the Merger, Willis effected (i) a consolidation (i.e., a reverse stock split under Irish law) of Willis ordinary shares whereby every 2.6490 Willis ordinary shares were consolidated into one Willis ordinary share (the ‘Consolidation’) and (ii) an amendment to its Constitution and other organizational documents to change its name from Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company to Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company. 

We are integrating Legacy Willis and Legacy Towers Watson (‘Legacy Companies’, collectively) and creating a unified platform for global growth, including positioning the Company to leverage our mutual distribution strength to enhance market penetration, expand our global footprint and create a strong platform for further innovation. The fully integrated Company will have a more comprehensive offering of services and solutions to provide to clients across four business segments: Corporate Risk and Broking; Exchange Solutions; Human Capital and Benefits; and Investment, Risk and Reinsurance.

Due to the closing date of the Merger on January 4, 2016, after the end of the fiscal year, Legacy Towers Watson results of operations and financial position are not presented in this Form 10-K. Please see Note 31 — Subsequent Events for additional information.

Until we are integrated, we will continue to manage our business through the Legacy Company platforms. Legacy Willis has four reportable operating segments: Willis GB; Willis Capital, Wholesale & Reinsurance (‘Willis CWR’); Willis North America; and Willis International. Legacy Towers Watson has four reportable operating segments: Benefits; Exchange Solutions; Risk and Financial Services; and Talent and Rewards. From April 1, 2016, we expect to manage our business across four integrated reportable operating segments: Corporate Risk and Broking; Exchange Solutions; Human Capital and Benefits; and Investment, Risk and Reinsurance.

Market Conditions

The following describes market conditions impacting Legacy Willis operations in the periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. 

Due to the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenues may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenues and can have a material adverse impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. A ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our commission revenues and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography, industry and client segment. As a result, and due to the global and diverse nature of our business, we view rates in the aggregate.

Market conditions in our industry are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world, insurance rate movements, and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients.

In 2014 we noted a continuation of the trend of growing complexity in the reinsurance market and a softening of prices, and signs of acceleration towards softening reinsurance rates across almost all classes of business and geographies as positive 2013 results for traditional reinsurers exacerbated the growing supply of capital from third-party investors. In addition, for primary insurance companies, the ability to recognize primary rate increases may be coming to an end and, consequently, rate flattening and even rate reductions are seen in many territories on primary insurance classes.

In 2015 we saw an easing of both reinsurance and primary insurance rates across most lines of business, although the rate of decline varies significantly by market and geography, and the marketplace continues to both favor and offer opportunities for the buyers of (re)insurance. Markets clearly continue to face significant over-capacity and competitive pricing conditions, and 

51
Willis Towers Watson plc

overall underwriting margins remain under substantial pressure. Although we are beginning to see the return of more normal market conditions, these challenging and uneven market conditions may result in quarterly volatility in actual financial performance in comparison to our 2015 strategic and financial goals.

In the face of this challenging economic environment, we have adopted a strategy to (1) invest selectively in growth areas, defined by geography, industry sector, and client segment and (2) better coordinate our segments so as to bring our clients greater access to the Company’s specialty areas and analytical capabilities. Our growth strategy also involves increasing our investment in, and deployment of, our analytical capabilities.

With respect to the Legacy Towers Watson operations, the market for our services is subject to change as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. Regulatory and legislative actions, along with continuously evolving technological developments, will likely have the greatest impact on the overall market for our exchange products. We believe the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to stockholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution, a provider's capability in delivering a broad number of configurations to serve various population segments and financing options, and an innovative service delivery model and platform. For our traditional consulting and risk management services and the rapidly evolving exchange products, we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors.

Financial Performance

The following is a summary of Legacy Willis’ 2015 GAAP financial results: 

•Total revenues of $3,829 million increased by $27 million, or 0.7 percent over the prior year. This growth comprised $115 million organic growth in commissions and fees, led by our International segment which reported high single digit growth, and a net $157 million increase from the impact of acquisitions and disposals, partially offset by $15 million organic decline in other revenues and $230 million adverse foreign currency movements. 

•Total operating expenses of $3,402 million increased by $247 million, or 7.8 percent over the prior year. This growth included a $90 million increase in restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program, a $77 million increase in M&A related-transaction costs, a $70 litigation provision, a $181 million net increase in expenses from acquisitions and disposals, partially offset by $197 million favorable foreign currency movements. 

•Operating margin decreased 580 basis points to 11.2 percent from 17.0 percent in the prior year, as the increase in total operating expenses exceeded the increase in total revenues, primarily due to the $90 million increase in restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program, the $70 million litigation provision referred to above, and the increase in expenses due to the mid-year acquisition of Miller initially exceeding the increase in revenues generated by the acquisition, due the seasonal profile of the business.

•Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson was $373 million, or $5.41 per diluted share, an increase of $11 million, or 3.0 percent, from $362 million, or $5.32 per diluted share, in 2014.

•Cash flows from operating activities were $243 million in 2015, a decrease of $234 million, or 49.1 percent from $477 million in 2014. The $234 decrease was largely due to the following: higher cash outflow for restructuring costs and M&A transaction-related costs; higher cash outflow for incentives; and increase in accounts receivable from growth in the business and the timing of cash collections.

Our non-GAAP financial measures were as follows:

•Underlying total revenues of $3,829 million increased $257 million, or 7.2 percent, over the prior year. Excluding the net $157 million increase from acquisitions and disposals, organic total revenues increased $100 million, or 2.8 percent over the prior year. This growth was driven by high commissions and fees growth in our International segment, supported by growth in Willis North America; partially offset by an $11 million decrease in other income due to the non-recurrence of a settlement related to a specialty book of business within Willis CWR.

52
Management’s Discussion and Analysis

•Underlying total expenses of $3,122 million increased $207 million, or 7.1 percent, over the prior year. Excluding the net $181 million increase from acquisitions and disposals, organic total operating expenses of $2,912 million increased $26 million, or 0.9 percent, over the prior year. 

•The resultant organic operating margin increased by 150 basis points to 19.5 percent from 18.0 percent in the prior year.

Acquisitions and Disposals

Legacy Willis continued to successfully deliver on its measured acquisition strategy, which has been focused on high quality, specialized firms with leading market positions, and has continued to contribute to the Company’s overall growth rate.

Revenues from the twelve-month impact of acquisitions (net of disposals) have increased total revenues by $157 million more in 2015 than in 2014. Additionally, the twelve-month impact of acquisitions (net of disposals) has contributed approximately $12 million more to EBITDA compared with 2014.

The following are the key Legacy Willis acquisitions completed during 2015:

•On May 31, 2015, Legacy Willis acquired an 85 percent interest in Miller Insurance Services LLP and its subsidiaries, a leading London wholesale specialist insurance broking firm.

•On December 29, 2015, Legacy Willis acquired substantially all of the remaining share capital of GS & Cie Group (‘Gras Savoye’), the leading insurance broker in France. Gras Savoye has access to high-growth markets through a comprehensive network that spans Central and Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East.

During 2015, Legacy Willis also acquired:

•Carsa Consultores, Agente de Seguros y de Fianzas de CV and its group companies, a leading insurance broker in Mexico;

•the trade and assets of Evolution Benefits Consulting, Inc., a human capital practice in Pennsylvania;

•Elite Risk Services, Taiwan;

•CKA Risk Solutions, Australia; 

•Sparsam, Sweden; 

•PMI Group, UK (Private Medicine Intermediaries); and

•the remaining interest in Miller do Brasil.

Operational improvement program

In April 2014, Legacy Willis announced an operational improvement program that would allow it to continue to strengthen its client service, realize operational efficiencies, and invest in new capabilities for growth. 

The main elements of the program include the following:

•movement of more than 3,500 support roles from higher cost locations to Willis facilities in lower cost locations, bringing the ratio of employees in higher cost versus lower cost near-shore and off-shore centers from approximately 80:20 to approximately 60:40;

•net workforce reductions in support positions;

•lease consolidation in real estate and reductions in ratios of seats per employee and square footage of floor space per employee; and

•information technology systems simplification and rationalization.

The program began in the second quarter of 2014 and is expected to be complete by the end of 2017. The program was expecting to deliver cumulative cost savings of at least $420 million through 2017 and annual cost savings of approximately $300 million starting in 2018. However, due to strong execution against the overall strategy to date, the Company has increased 

53
Willis Towers Watson plc

its expectations for cost savings from the program. The annual cost savings expected to be generated by the end of 2017 are now expected to be $325 million and the cumulative savings are now expected to be in excess of $490 million through the end of the program. The program cumulative expected savings exclude merger-related savings.

Actual cost savings of approximately $123 million were achieved in 2014 and 2015, taken together, and the estimated phasing of future cost savings is as follows: up to approximately $150 million in 2016, and up to approximately $250 million in 2017. The estimated cost savings are before any potential reinvestment for future growth. 

To achieve these savings, the Company now expects to incur restructuring charges amounting up to approximately $440 million through the end of 2017. Program spend in 2014 and 2015, taken together, was $162 million, with approximately $140 million expected for 2016 and the balance of approximately $125 million expected to be incurred in 2017.

Total spend, actual savings, and timing may vary positively or negatively from these estimates due to changes in the scope, underlying assumptions, or execution risk of the restructuring plan throughout its duration.

The Company expects that about 75 percent of the annualized 2018 savings would come from role relocation and reduction, and about 25 percent of the savings from real estate, information technology and other areas.

Relevant Legacy Willis metrics are:

•ratio of full time employees (FTEs) in higher cost geographies to lower cost near-shore and off-shore centers as at December 31, 2015 was 75:25 (December 31, 2014 ratio was 78:22; March 31, 2014 ratio was 80:20);

•indexed ratio of square footage of real estate per FTE as at December 31, 2015 was 95 (December 31, 2014 ratio was 98; March 31, 2014 ratio was 100); and 

•indexed ratio of desks per FTE as at December 31, 2015 was 101 (December 31, 2014 ratio was 99 (March 31, 2014 ratio was 100). 

By releasing 93,000 square feet of space since March 2014, we have been able to have more employees occupy a smaller area. We are still adding employees to our new office in Tampa, Florida, completed in the fourth quarter of 2015, which has impacted the desk per FTE ratio, as have the additional desks required throughout the business for contractors and consultants not included in the FTE headcount.

The restructuring costs of $126 million related to the Operational Improvement Program incurred in 2015 were:

•$31 million in the Willis North America, comprising $8 million termination benefits and $23 million professional services and other program costs; 

•$27 million in Willis GB, comprising $10 million termination benefits and $17 million professional services and other program costs; 

•$26 million in Willis International, comprising $8 million termination benefits and $18 million professional services and other program costs; 

•$9 million in Willis CWR, comprising $7 million termination benefits and $2 million professional services and other program costs; and

•$33 million in Corporate and other, comprising $3 million termination benefits and $30 million professional services and other program costs.

UK Defined Benefit Pension Scheme

Salary freeze

On March 6, 2015, Legacy Willis announced to members of the UK defined benefit pension plan that, with effect from June 30, 2015, future salary increases would not be pensionable (the ‘salary freeze’). The Company has recognized the salary freeze as a plan amendment at the announcement date. The impact of the salary freeze is to reduce the plan’s projected benefit obligation by approximately $215 million and create a prior service credit which is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) and then amortized to the Statement of Operations over the remaining expected service life of active employees.

54
Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Schedule of contributions

On December 31, 2015, Legacy Willis agreed to a revised schedule of contributions towards on-going accrual of benefits and deficit funding contributions the Company will make to the UK Plan to the end of 2024. The revised schedule of contributions replaces the previous agreement and therefore eliminates the clauses over profit share contributions and exceptional return contributions that became payable in certain circumstances. 

Based on the revised agreement, contributions in 2016 will total approximately $83 million being deficit funding contributions of approximately $53 million, on-going contributions of approximately $22 million and the final contingent contribution of approximately $8 million following the share buybacks made in 2015.

Annual deficit funding contributions will reduce to approximately $22 million for 2017 through 2020 although additional ‘funding level’ contributions may become payable based on funding level assessments made between December 31, 2017 and 2024. Such annual funding level contributions are capped at approximately $15 million. From 2021 annual deficit funding contributions may be ceased, and instead paid into escrow, if the Scheme is ahead of its funding plan.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Legacy Willis non-GAAP financial measures for 2015

We believe that the understanding of the Company’s performance and comparative analysis of our results is enhanced by our disclosure of the following non-GAAP financial measures. We use these and other measures to establish Group performance targets and evaluate the performance of our operations. 

Our method for calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. Our calculation methods are:

•Underlying measures

Our underlying non-GAAP measures are calculated by excluding restructuring costs relating to the Operational Improvement Program, the impact of the Venezuelan Bolivar devaluation, certain litigation provisions, gains (losses) on disposal of operations, remeasurement of previously held equity interests, non-recurring changes in deferred tax valuation allowances and, from the second quarter of 2015, merger and acquisition (‘M&A’) transaction-related costs, as relevant, from total revenues, total expenses, salaries and benefits, other operating expenses, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measures. As a result of excluding merger and acquisition transaction-related costs from the second quarter of 2015, underlying non-GAAP measures for 2014 have been restated.

Additionally, prior year total revenues, total expenses, net income and diluted earnings per share have been rebased to current period exchange rates to eliminate the impact of year-over-year foreign exchange movements.

•Organic measures

Our organic non-GAAP measures are calculated by further excluding the twelve-month impact from acquisitions and disposals from our underlying measures.

As set out in the tables below, underlying operating income increased $50 million, or 7.6 percent, to $707 million in 2015 compared with $657 million in 2014. Underlying operating margin at 18.5 percent in 2015 was up 10 basis points compared with 2014, while 2015 underlying net income was $441 million, $44 million higher than in 2014. Underlying earnings per diluted share were $6.39 in 2015, compared with $5.83 in 2014.

As set out in the tables below, organic operating income increased $74 million, or 11.7 percent, to $706 million in 2015 compared with $632 million in 2014. Organic operating margin at 19.5 percent in 2015 was up 150 basis points compared with 2014.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Consolidated Results for 2015 compared to 2014 

Revenues

Total revenues by segment for 2015 and 2014 are shown below (millions, except percentages):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]_________________

(a) Organic commissions and fees growth excludes: (i) the impact of foreign currency translation; (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions; and (iii) the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented. Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.

Total revenues of $3,829 million increased by $27 million, or 0.7 percent, in 2015 compared to 2014. This was primarily due to 1.1 percent growth in commissions and fees.

Total commissions and fees in 2015 were $3,809 million, up $42 million, or 1.1 percent, from $3,767 million in 2014. This increase was comprised of organic growth of $115 million, or 3.3 percent, and growth through acquisitions and disposals of $155 million, or 4.3 percent, partially offset by negative foreign currency movements of $228 million or 6.5 percent. 

The foreign currency impact was as a result of the strengthening of the US dollar against a number of currencies, most significantly the Euro and the Pound Sterling. 

Willis GB reported a 3.8 percent reduction in commissions and fees as organic growth of 1.8 percent was offset by a 5.4 percent negative impact from foreign currency translation and a net 0.2 percent decline from acquisitions and disposals primarily due to the disposal of our niche classic car business and Preston and Dundee retail operations, partially offset by the acquisition of PMI and certain Miller businesses.

Organic commissions and fees growth of 1.8 percent was primarily due to growth in Financial Lines, Property & Casualty and Aerospace.

Willis Capital, Wholesale & Reinsurance reported 8.3 percent growth in commissions and fees, comprising 1.0 percent organic growth and an 11.5 percent positive impact from acquisitions and disposals primarily driven by the acquisition of Miller Insurance Services in the first half of 2015. This growth was partially offset by a 4.2 percent negative impact from foreign currency translation.

Organic commissions and fees growth of 1.0 percent was primarily due to growth in Reinsurance and new business wins in Willis Capital Markets & Advisory.

Willis North America reported 1.5 percent decline in commissions and fees compared to 2014 including organic growth of 2.4 percent partially offset by 3.5 percent negative impact from the disposal of non-strategic low growth offices, and a negative 0.4 percent impact from foreign currency translation. 

Willis International reported growth of 2.4 percent in commissions and fees compared with 2014, comprising 7.6 percent organic growth and 13.5 percent positive acquisitions impact, largely from the acquisition of Max Matthiessen. This was partially offset by an 18.7 percent negative impact from foreign currency translation. 

63
Willis Towers Watson plc

Organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in ‘Review of Segmental Results’, below.

Other income reported a decrease of $11 million compared with 2014. This decrease was due to a $15 million decrease in settlements, partially offset by a $4 million increase in income from sales of US books of business.

Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and benefits were $2,306 million, or 0.3 percent, lower in 2015 compared with 2014 and include a net $109 million increase from acquisitions and disposals offset by $148 million of favorable foreign currency movements. The remaining increase of $31 million was driven by increased headcount, pay reviews, and higher incentives, partially offset by lower benefits.

Other Expenses

Other operating expenses were $140 million, or 21.2 percent, higher in 2015 compared with 2014. This growth included a net increase of $2 million in organic other operating costs, a net $36 million increase from acquisitions and disposals, a $70 million increase relating to litigation provisions and a $74 million increase in M&A transaction-related costs. Growth was partially offset by $42 million of favorable foreign currency movements. 

Depreciation expense was $95 million in 2015, compared with $92 million in 2014. The increase of $3 million included an organic increase of $4 million and a net $4 million increase from acquisitions and disposals, partially offset by $5 million of favorable foreign currency movements. 

Amortization of intangible assets was $76 million in 2015, an increase of $22 million compared to 2014. The increase primarily reflects the increased charge relating to recent acquisitions including Charles Monat and Max Matthiessen, partially offset by the ongoing reduction in the HRH acquisition amortization 

Restructuring costs related to our operational improvement program were $126 million in 2015, compared with $36 million in 2014. This is discussed in further detail in the ‘Operational improvement program’ section in the Executive Summary section above. 

Other Income (Expense), net 

Other income (expense), net increased by $49 million compared to 2014. This increase was primarily due to a $59 million gain on the remeasurement of the previously equity accounted investment in Gras Savoye and increased gains on disposals of operations partially offset by an increase in the foreign currency loss in Venezuela.

Income Taxes 

The tax rate for 2015 was (10) percent, compared with 31 percent for 2014. The decrease in tax rate over the prior year is mainly attributable to the partial release of the valuation allowance in the US.

After adjusting for certain items, as listed below, the tax rate for 2015 was 22 percent: 

•a tax benefit of $nil associated with the $30 million pre-tax expense arising in relation to the Venezuela currency devaluation;

•a tax benefit of $28 million associated with charges of $126 million incurred in relation to the Operational Improvement Program; 

•a tax expense of $4 million associated with pre-tax gains of $25 million related to business disposals;

•a tax benefit of $96 million relating to a partial release of the US valuation allowance;

•a tax benefit of $10 million associated with M&A transaction-related costs of $84 million; 

•a tax benefit of $28 million associated with a $70 million litigation provision; and

•a tax expense of $nil associated with the $59 million gain on remeasurement of equity interests.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Interest in Earnings of Associates, net of Tax

The majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of Gras Savoye, the leading broker in France. Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, in 2015 was $11 million compared with $14 million in 2014. Following the acquisition of substantially all of the remaining share capital of Gras Savoye on December 29, 2015, interest in earnings of associates from that date no longer includes earnings from Gras Savoye, as we now consolidate Gras Savoye.

Consolidated Results for 2014 compared to 2013 

Revenues

Total revenues by segment for 2014 and 2013 are shown below (millions, except percentages):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]_________________

(a) Organic commissions and fees growth excludes: (i) the impact of foreign currency translation; (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions; and (iii) the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented. Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.

Total revenues of $3,802 million increased by $147 million, or 4.0 percent, in 2014 compared to 2013. This was primarily due to 3.7 percent growth in commissions and fees.

Total commissions and fees in 2014 were $3,767 million, up $134 million, or 3.7 percent, from $3,633 million in 2013. This increase comprised organic growth of $134 million, or 3.8 percent, and growth through acquisitions and disposals of $28 million, or 0.8 percent, partially offset by negative foreign currency movements of $30 million or 0.9 percent. 

The foreign currency impact was as a result of the strengthening of the US dollar against a number of currencies that our commissions and fees are earned in, most significantly the Euro, Australian dollar and Brazilian real, partially offset by the year-on-year weakening of the US dollar against the Pound Sterling. 

The Willis GB segment reported 0.5 percent decline in commissions and fees, as negative 1.5 percent organic growth and 0.4

adverse impact from acquisitions and disposals, primarily due to a disposal in second quarter 2013, was partially offset by a 1.4

percent favorable impact from foreign exchange.

Willis CWR reported 4.6 percent growth in commissions and fees, which includes organic growth of 4.3 percent, 0.2 percent

positive impact from acquisitions and 0.1 percent favorable movement from foreign currency movements.

Willis North America segment reported 1.1 percent growth in commissions and fees compared to 2013 including organic

growth of 2.7 percent which was partially offset by 1.6 percent negative impact from the disposal of non-strategic low growth

offices. Foreign currency movements had no impact on commissions and fees.

Willis International segment reported 9.5 percent growth in commissions and fees compared with 2013, comprising 8.8 percent

organic growth and 5.6 percent positive impact from the acquisitions of Max Matthiessen and Charles Monat during 2014. This

was partially offset by a 4.9 percent negative impact from foreign currency movements.

65
Willis Towers Watson plc

Organic commissions and fees growth by segment is discussed further in ‘Review of Segmental Results’, below.

Other income reported an increase of $12 million compared to 2013. This increase was primarily due to a $12 million

settlement related to a specialty book of business within the Willis CWR segment.

Salaries and Benefits

Salaries and benefits were $107 million, or 4.8 percent, higher in 2014 compared with 2013 and include a net $20 million increase from acquisitions and disposals and $3 million of adverse foreign currency movements, offset by a $29 million benefit from the non-recurrence of 2013 expense reduction initiative costs. The remaining increase of $113 million was driven by increased headcount, pay reviews, and higher incentives. 

Other Expenses

Other operating expenses were $23 million, or 3.6 percent, higher in 2014 compared with 2013. This growth included a net $9 million increase from acquisitions and disposals and $2 million of adverse foreign currency movements, offset by a $12 million benefit from the non-recurrence of 2013 expense reduction initiative costs and marketing costs. The remaining increase of $25 million was primarily due to higher travel, accommodation and entertainment expenses, along with increased systems costs.

Depreciation expense was $92 million in 2014, compared with $94 million in 2013. The decrease of $2 million included $5 million benefit from non-recurrence of 2013 expense reduction initiative costs offset by $1 million of adverse foreign currency movements.

Amortization of intangible assets was $54 million in 2014, a reduction of $1 million compared to 2013. The decrease primarily reflects the ongoing reduction in the HRH acquisition amortization partially offset by the increased charge relating to the acquisition of Charles Monat and Max Matthiessen. 

Restructuring costs related to our operational improvement program were $36 million in 2014, compared with $nil in 2013. This is discussed in further detail in the ‘Operational improvement program’ section in the executive summary section above. 

Income Taxes 

The tax rate for 2014 was 31 percent, compared with 24 percent for 2013. Both years were impacted by certain items and the continuing requirement to retain a valuation allowance against our US deferred tax assets. The increase in tax rate over the prior year is partly attributable to the US returning to a tax paying position for the 2014 tax year.

After adjusting for certain items, as listed below, the tax rate for 2014 was 25 percent: 

•a tax benefit of $1 million associated with the $14 million pre-tax expense arising in relation to the Venezuela currency devaluation;

•a tax benefit of $9 million associated with charges incurred in relation to the Operational Improvement Program; 

•a tax expense of $10 million associated with pre-tax gains of $12 million related to business disposals;

•an expense of $21 million relating to an increase in US valuation allowance. The increase is attributable to a change in the US deferred tax position following resolution of uncertain tax positions from prior periods.

Interest in Earnings of Associates, net of Tax

The majority of our interest in earnings of associates relates to our share of ownership of Gras Savoye, the leading broker in France. Interest in earnings of associates, net of tax, in 2014 was $14 million compared to $nil in 2013. The increase was primarily due to the non-recurrence of charges relating to the 2013 reorganization program and other non-recurring items, with improved underlying financial performance, in Gras Savoye.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity

The Merger with Towers Watson did not have any impact on Legacy Willis’ liquidity (ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet needs for cash), due to the share-for-share nature of the Merger, except for: the acceleration of the dividend paid in December 2015, which would otherwise have been paid in January 2016; and the $400 million tranche drawn on January 4, 2016 under the Legacy Willis 1-year term loan facility, which was used to re-finance debt held by Legacy Towers Watson which became due on acquisition.

Legacy Willis funded the cash consideration for the acquisition of Gras Savoye with a 1-year term loan. 

Legacy Willis’ principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under revolving credit facilities. Legacy Towers Watson’s principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents, and amounts available under a revolving credit facility. 

Based on our combined balance sheets, combined cash flows, current market conditions and information available to us at this time, including a potential refinancing of our debt financing in 2016, we believe that Willis Towers Watson has sufficient liquidity, which includes our undrawn revolving credit facilities, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including investing in the business for growth, creating value through the integration of Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye, making scheduled debt repayments, and making contemplated dividend payments. 

Consistent with our liquidity position, management considers various alternative strategic uses of cash reserves. As part of the integration of Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye, the Company is considering restructuring its debt financing in 2016, dependent on market and other conditions at the time. The Company will also consider buying back shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. 

Legacy Willis

Legacy Willis’ principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities, excluding the UK facility which is solely for use by our main regulated UK entity in certain exceptional circumstances, and the Willis Securities facility, which is solely used for regulatory capital and securities underwriting purposes only. 

Legacy Willis’ principal short-term uses of liquidity and capital resources are operating expenses, capital expenditures, dividends, funding defined benefit pension plans, and servicing of debt, including redemption of senior notes and repayment of borrowings under our 1-year term loan facility.

Legacy Willis’ long-term liquidity requirements, as of December 31, 2015, consisted of the repayment of the principal amount of outstanding notes; borrowings under our term loan facility expiring in 2018 and under our $800 million revolving credit facility; and funding defined benefit pension plans as discussed below.

As at December 31, 2015 cash and cash equivalents were $532 million, a decrease of $103 million compared to December 31, 2014. 

Included within cash and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2015 is a proportion held for regulatory capital adequacy requirements, including $82 million held within our regulated UK entities for regulatory capital adequacy requirements. 

Cash flows from operating activities fell to $243 million in 2015 from $477 million in 2014. In addition, $13 million was provided from the disposal of fixed and intangible assets (2014: $6 million), $124 million proceeds from the issue of shares (2014: $134 million), and $44 million proceeds from the disposal of operations (2014: $86 million). 

As at December 31, 2015 there was $467 million drawn down on our revolving credit facilities (2014: $nil). During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made 17 drawings totaling $1,120 million and 14 repayments totaling $651 million on the $800 million Trinity Acquisition facility and 2 drawings totaling $704 million and 3 repayments totaling $704 million on the $400 million Willis Securities facility. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Legacy Willis took out a $592 million 1-year term loan to fund the acquisition of Gras Savoye.

The primary uses of funds during 2015 included: $857 million payments of consideration for acquisitions (of operations and intangible assets), primarily Gras Savoye and Miller; $439 million cash payments of incentive awards, primarily relating to 

67
Willis Towers Watson plc

2014; $277 million dividend payments; $166 million repayments of debt; $146 million capital expenditure related to leasehold improvements and furniture and equipment, including in relation to information technology projects; and $118 million cash contributions, including employees’ salary sacrifice contributions, to our defined benefit pension schemes.

Legacy Willis suspended its previously authorized share buyback program on June 30, 2015, pending the completion of the Merger with Towers Watson. During 2015, Legacy Willis bought back approximately 1,710,000 shares for a total cost of $82 million, of its intended $175 million 2015 buyback program, to offset the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the exercise of employee stock options.

The impact of movements in liquidity, debt and EBITDA in 2015 had a positive impact on the interest coverage ratio and a negative impact on the leverage ratio. On December 29, 2015, we exercised our right to request that the leverage ratio be automatically increased as a result of acquisitions, including the acquisition of Gras Savoye. Both these Legacy Willis ratios remain within the requirements of the relevant debt covenants.

Debt

Legacy Willis total debt, total equity and the capitalization ratio at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_________________________________

(i)  As described in Note 2, following retrospective application of ASU 2015-03, ‘Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs’, debt issuance costs related to a note are now reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of that note. 2014 balances have been reclassified accordingly.

At December 31, 2015 the only mandatory Legacy Willis debt repayments of principal falling due over the next 12 months are $300 million outstanding on our 4.125% senior notes, $592 million outstanding on the 1-year term loan taken out in the fourth quarter of 2015 to fund the acquisition of Gras Savoye, $23 million outstanding under the term loan expiring in 2018, and $79 million outstanding under a bank overdraft arrangement (repaid on January 11, 2016).

As part of the integration of Willis, Towers Watson and Gras Savoye, the Company is considering restructuring its debt financing in the near term to both extend maturities and refinance certain items as they fall due during 2016. We anticipate this restructuring will include raising market finance of $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion. Any such restructuring is dependent on market and other conditions at the time.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Cash flow

Summary Legacy Willis consolidated cash flow information (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

This summary consolidated cash flow should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Consolidated Legacy Willis Cash Flow for 2015 compared to 2014 

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 decreased by $234 million to $243 million compared with 2014.

The $243 million cash from operations comprises net income of $384 million, adjusted for $38 million of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities net of $179 million of negative working capital movements. 

The non-cash adjustments included a net gain on disposals, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, net defined benefit pension costs, share-based compensation, provisions for deferred income taxes and the effect of exchange rate changes.

The $179 million negative movement in working capital included $439 million of incentive payments and $118 million cash contributions (including $9 million for employees’ salary sacrifice and $21 million contingent contributions) to our defined benefit pension schemes. Additionally, there was a $155 million increase in accounts receivable, as revenue recognized in 2015 was greater than cash collection, and $495 million positive movement in other liabilities which includes incentives accrued during 2015 that will be paid in 2016.

The $234 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 was largely due to the following: higher cash outflow for restructuring costs and M&A transaction-related transaction costs; higher cash outflow for incentives; increase in accounts receivable from growth in the business; and the timing of cash collections.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities in 2015 was $943 million. This included cash used to purchase subsidiaries and intangible assets of $857 million and capital expenditure of $146 million, partly offset by $44 million of proceeds from the disposal of operations and $13 million cash received from the sale of fixed and intangible assets.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 was $641 million, primarily due to $469 million drawings on our $800 million revolving credit facility, a new $592 million term loan drawn down in the fourth quarter of 2015 to fund the acquisition of Gras Savoye and $124 million proceeds from the issue of shares, partly offset by dividends paid, including to noncontrolling interests, of $293 million, $82 million to repurchase approximately 1,710,000 shares and $166 million of debt repayments.

Willis Towers Watson plc

Consolidated Legacy Willis Cash Flow for 2014 compared to 2013 

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 decreased by $84 million to $477 million compared with 2013.

The $477 million cash from operations comprises net income of $373 million, net $257 million of non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities and $153 million of negative working capital movements. 

The non-cash adjustments included depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, share-based compensation and provisions for deferred income taxes.

Movements in working capital included $401 million of incentive payments and $122 million cash contributions (including $10 million for employees’ salary sacrifice) to our defined benefit pension schemes. Additionally, there was a $66 million increase in accounts receivable, as revenue recognized in 2014 was greater than cash collection, and $432 million positive movement in other liabilities which included incentives accrued during 2014 that will be paid in 2015.

The $84 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 was primarily driven by lower reported operating income, the non-recurrence of closed-out derivative contracts in the prior year, increased working capital and higher cash taxes paid.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities in 2014 was $276 million. This included capital expenditure of $113 million, cash used to purchase subsidiaries, intangible assets and other investments of $255 million partly offset by $6 million cash received from the sale of fixed and intangible assets and $86 million of proceeds from the disposal of operations.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities in 2014 was $323 million primarily due to dividends paid, including to noncontrolling interests, of $227 million, $213 million to repurchase approximately five million shares and $15 million of mandatory repayments against the term loan offset by cash receipts of $134 million from the issue of shares. 

Own funds

As of December 31, 2015, Legacy Willis had cash and cash equivalents of $532 million, compared with $635 million at December 31, 2014. Additionally, $755 million was available to draw under Legacy Willis revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2015, compared with $1,222 million at December 31, 2014, and $400 million was available to draw under Legacy Willis’ 1-year term loan facility at December 31, 2015. The $400 million available under the the 1-year term loan facility was subsequently drawn, on January 4, 2016, in connection with the Merger.

Fiduciary funds

As an intermediary, Legacy Willis holds funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by, or due to, us which are due to clients are also shown as both assets and liabilities. 

Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in certain regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds.

As of December 31, 2015, Legacy Willis had fiduciary funds of $2.3 billion, compared with $1.9 billion at December 31, 2014.

Share buybacks

Legacy Willis suspended its previously authorized share buyback program on June 30, 2015, pending the completion of the Merger. During 2015, the Company bought back approximately 1,710,000 shares for a total cost of $82 million, of its intended $175 million 2015 buyback program, to offset the increase in shares outstanding resulting from the exercise of employee stock options. 

70
Management’s Discussion and Analysis

The Company will also consider buying back shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. The maximum number of shares that may be purchased under the existing share buyback program based on the Company’s closing stock price on December 31, 2015 of $128.66 was 4,111,475. 

Dividends

Cash dividends paid by Legacy Willis in 2015 were $277 million compared with $210 million in 2014 and $193 million in 2013. In February 2016, Willis Towers Watson declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.48 per share, an annual rate of $1.92 per share.

REVIEW OF SEGMENTAL RESULTS

We are integrating the Legacy Companies of Willis and Towers Watson and creating a unified platform for global growth, including positioning the Company to leverage our mutual distribution strength to enhance market penetration, expand our global footprint and create a strong platform for further innovation. The fully integrated Company will have a more comprehensive offering of services and solutions to provide to clients across four business segments: Corporate Risk and Broking; Exchange Solutions; Human Capital and Benefits; and Investment, Risk and Reinsurance.

Until we are integrated, we will continue to manage our business through the Legacy Company platforms. Legacy Willis had four reportable operating segments: Willis GB; Willis Capital, Wholesale & Reinsurance; Willis North America; and Willis International. Legacy Towers Watson had four reportable operating segments: Benefits; Exchange Solutions; Risk and Financial Services; and Talent and Rewards. From April 1, 2016, we expect to manage our business across four integrated reportable operating segments: Corporate Risk and Broking; Exchange Solutions; Human Capital and Benefits; and Investment, Risk and Reinsurance.

Due to the closing date of the Merger on January 4, 2016, after the end of the fiscal year, Legacy Towers Watson results of operations and financial position are not presented in this Form 10-K. Please see Note 31 — Subsequent Events for additional information.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Willis GB

Willis GB, our Great Britain-based specialty and retail business, comprised the following business units: Property & Casualty; Financial Lines; Transport; and Retail Networks.

The following table sets out the components of Willis GB’s revenues, and its organic commissions and fees growth, operating income and margin for the three years ended December 31, 2015 (in millions, except percentages):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_________________

(a) Other income comprises gains on disposal of intangible assets, which primarily arise from settlements through enforcing non-compete agreements in the event of losing accounts through producer defection or the disposal of books of business.

(b) Organic commissions and fees growth excludes: (i) the impact of foreign currency translation; (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions; and (iii) the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented.

(c) Percentages may differ due to rounding.

2015 compared to 2014 

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $637 million were $25 million, or 3.8 percent, lower in 2015 compared with 2014. 

Organic commissions and fees growth, which excludes an adverse 5.4 percent impact from foreign currency movements and a net 0.2 percent decline due to acquisitions and disposals, was 1.8 percent compared with 2014.

The 1.8 percent organic growth in commissions and fees was primarily due to growth in Financial Lines, Property & Casualty and Aerospace. 

The 0.2 percent decline from acquisitions and disposals was related to the disposal of our niche classic car business and

Preston and Dundee retail operations, partially offset by the acquisition of PMI and certain Miller businesses. 

The turnaround efforts in this segment are starting to come to fruition as management continues to re-engineer the cost base while reinvesting in growth. 

The adverse foreign currency movements were primarily due to the weakening of the Euro and Pound sterling against the US dollar.

Expenses

Total operating expenses of $498 million were $23 million, or 4.4 percent, lower for 2015 compared with 2014. 

Underlying total expenses, which exclude $29 million of favorable foreign currency movements, partially offset by a $17 million increase in restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program and a $2 million increase in M&A transaction-related costs, decreased $13 million, or 2.7 percent, compared with 2014.

The $13 million, or 2.7 percent, decrease in underlying total expenses was primarily due to lower salaries and benefits, as a result of efficiency savings from the Operational Improvement Program, and lower other operating expenses as a consequence of cost management initiatives.

Organic expenses, which exclude the impact from foreign currency movements, acquisitions and disposals, restructuring costs and M&A transaction-related costs, decreased by $14 million, or 2.9 percent, compared with 2014, again driven by lower salaries and benefits as a result of efficiency savings from the Operational Improvement Program, and lower other operating expenses as a result of cost management initiatives. 

73
Willis Towers Watson plc

The favorable foreign currency movements were primarily due to the weakening of the Euro and Pound sterling against the US dollar.

See the ‘Operational Improvement Program’ section above for further details of the restructuring costs.

Operating margin

Operating margin was 22.3 percent in 2015, up 20 basis points from 22.1 percent in 2014, reflecting the underlying improvement from organic revenue growth and expense reduction, partially offset primarily by net adverse foreign exchange movements and the restructuring costs of the Operational Improvement Program. 

2014 compared to 2013 

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $662 million were $3 million, or 0.5 percent, lower in 2014 compared with 2013. The decrease includes negative organic growth of 1.5 percent and a 0.4 percent adverse impact from acquisitions and disposals partially offset by 1.4 percent positive impact from foreign currency movements.

The 1.5 percent negative organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by the negative impact of rates and the non-recurrence of significant construction projects in 2014. The low single-digit decline was primarily due to poor performance in the Insolvency and Willis Commercial Network businesses of Retail Networks and Property & Casualty partially offset by mid-single digit growth in Financial Lines.

The 0.4 percent decline from acquisitions and disposals was related to the disposal of a small commercial business from the UK Retail division during 2013 partially offset by the acquisition of Prime Professions in second quarter 2013.

Other income of $3 million included a legal settlement related to the departure of an Aerospace producer.

Expenses

Total operating expenses of $521 million were $36 million, or 7.4 percent, higher for 2014 compared with 2013. 

The $36 million growth in expenses was due to adverse foreign currency movements and higher salaries and benefits as a result of the increase in headcount relative to the prior year and annual salary reviews. This increase was offset by the decline in Other operating expenses primarily due to lower allocation of corporate costs and an E&O provision release partially offset by higher systems and premises costs.

In addition, the year-on-year growth included $10 million restructuring costs relating the Operational Improvement Program.

Operating margin

Full year operating margin was 22.1 percent in 2014 and 27.0 percent in 2013. The decline was driven by expense growth of 7.4 percent, which includes significant investment in specialist and client advocacy capability, exceeding the 0.5 percent total revenue growth.

Willis Capital, Wholesale & Reinsurance

Willis CWR operations comprised Willis Re, Willis Capital Markets & Advisory, our Wholesale business; and Portfolio and Underwriting Services. 

The following table sets out the components of Willis CWR’s revenues, and its organic commissions and fees growth, operating income and margin for the three years ended December 31, 2015 (in millions, except percentages):

(c) Percentages may differ due to rounding.

2015 compared to 2014 

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $811 million were $62 million, or 8.3 percent, higher in 2015 compared with 2014. 

Organic commissions and fees growth, which excludes a net 11.5 percent favorable impact from acquisitions and disposals, partially offset by an adverse 4.2 percent impact from foreign currency movements, was 1.0 percent.

The 1.0 percent organic growth in commissions and fees was primarily due to growth in Reinsurance and new business wins in Willis Capital Markets & Advisory. 

The 11.5 percent increase from acquisitions and disposals was primarily due to the acquisition of Miller Insurance Services LLP in the second quarter of 2015. 

The $11 million decrease in other income was primarily due to a $12 million settlement received in 2014 relating to a specialty book of business.

The adverse foreign currency movements were primarily due to the weakening of the Euro and Pound sterling against the US dollar.

Expenses

Total operating expenses of $657 million were $115 million, or 21.2 percent, higher for 2015 compared with 2014. 

Organic total expenses, which exclude a $97 million increase due to acquisitions and disposals, an $8 million increase in restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program and a $7 million increase in M&A transaction-related costs, partially offset by $20 million of favorable foreign currency movements, increased $23 million, or 4.5 percent, compared with 2014.

The $23 million, or 4.5 percent, increase in organic total expenses was due to a higher salaries and benefits expense due to annual pay increases and higher charges for incentives, and higher business development costs. 

See the ‘Operational Improvement Program’ section above for further details of the restructuring costs.

Operating margin was 19.4 percent in 2015, down 980 basis points from 29.2 percent in 2014. The decline was due to: the impact of acquisitions and disposals, including the effects of acquiring Miller part way through the year (388 basis points); business unit performance, mainly related to organic wholesale business, and increases in staff compensation (233 basis points); decrease arising from one-off investments as part of the Operational Improvement Program and from M&A transaction-related costs (228 basis points); and net adverse foreign currency movements during the year (131 basis points).

2014 compared to 2013 

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $749 million were $33 million, or 4.6 percent, higher in 2014 compared with 2013. The increase includes organic growth of 4.3 percent, a positive 0.1 percent impact from foreign currency movements and a 0.2 percent increase due to acquisitions and disposals.

The 4.3 percent organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by strong new business growth and higher client retention levels compared with the year ago period.

Reinsurance reported mid single-digit organic commissions and fees growth, with its North America business again leading the way with high single-digit growth. New business was strong across all three divisions and we reported increased client retention levels compared to the prior year. Growth however was tempered by the negative impact of premium rate movements. 

Willis Capital Markets & Advisory performed solidly in the year and reported significant growth on last year as a result of significant new business wins. 

Other income of $12 million related to a settlement for a specialty book of business.

Expenses

Total operating expenses of $542 million were $42 million, or 8.4 percent, higher for 2014 compared with 2013. 

The $42 million growth in expenses was due to adverse foreign currency movements and higher salaries and benefits as a result of the increase in headcount relative to the prior year, annual salary reviews and higher incentives which were linked to commissions and fees performance, and a legal claim settlement. 

In addition, the year-on-year growth included $1 million restructuring costs relating to the Operational Improvement Program.

Operating margin

Full year operating margin was 29.2 percent in 2014 and 30.7 percent in 2013. The decline was driven by expense growth of 8.4 percent exceeding the 6.2 percent total revenue growth.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Willis North America

Our North America business provided risk management, insurance brokerage, related risk services and employee benefits brokerage and consulting to a wide array of industry and client segments in the United States and Canada. 

The following table sets out revenues, operating income, organic commissions and fees growth and operating margin for the three years ended December 31, 2015 (in millions, except percentages):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_________________

(a) Commissions and fees in 2013 included a positive $5 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in the North America Personal Lines business with the rest of the Group.

(b) Other income comprises gains on disposal of intangible assets, which primarily arise from settlements through enforcing non-compete agreements in the event of losing accounts through producer defection or the disposal of books of business.

(c) Organic commissions and fees growth excludes: (i) the impact of foreign currency translation; (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions; and (iii) the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented. 

(d) Percentages may differ due to rounding.

2015 compared to 2014 

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $1,298 million were $20 million, or 1.5 percent, lower in 2015 compared with 2014. 

Organic commissions and fees growth, which excludes a 3.5 percent adverse net impact from acquisitions and disposals and a 0.4 percent adverse impact from foreign currency movements, was 2.4 percent. 

The 2.4 percent organic growth in commissions and fees included growth in the Construction business. 

The 3.5 percent adverse impact from acquisitions and disposals was primarily due to the disposal of non-strategic low growth offices.

Expenses

Total operating expenses of $1,118 million were $27 million, or 2.5 percent, higher for 2015 compared with 2014.

Underlying total expenses, which exclude a $28 million increase in restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program, partially offset by $5 million of favorable foreign currency movements, increased $4 million, or 0.4 percent, compared with 2014.

See the ‘Operational Improvement Program’ section above for further details of the restructuring costs.

Operating margin

Operating margin was 14.3 percent in 2015, down 320 basis points from 17.5 percent in 2014. Divestiture and restructuring costs were large contributors to the decline.

2014 compared to 2013 

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $1,318 million were $14 million, or 1.1 percent, higher in 2014 compared with 2013. 

This increase was primarily due to organic growth of 2.7 percent partially offset by a 1.6 percent negative impact from acquisitions and disposals. 

The acquisitions and disposals impact was primarily due to the disposal of non-strategic low growth offices in the second and fourth quarters of 2014 partially offset by the acquisition of the employee benefits consulting division of Capital Strategies in fourth quarter 2013.

The 2.7 percent organic growth in commissions and fees was driven by strong new business growth compared with the year ago period, partially offset by lost business and the non-recurrence of a positive $5 million adjustment in 2013 to align the recognition of revenue in the North America Personal Lines business with the rest of the Group. Rates had a small negative impact on the full year’s commissions and fees.

Growth was achieved across most of our North America regions, led by the South, Atlantic and Northeast regions as a result of new business growth. 

Similarly, most of the major practice groups recorded positive growth. Our two largest practices, Human Capital and Construction, recorded mid single and low single-digit growth respectively. In our other practices we recorded double-digit growth in Mergers & Acquisitions, Financial & Executive Risks and Service Industry. 

Expenses

Total operating expenses of $1,091 million were $17 million or 1.5 percent, lower for 2014 compared to 2013.

The $17 million reduction in expenses was due to lower incentives as a result of one-off adjustments, the reduction to the amortization of intangible assets and the disposal of certain non-strategic low growth locations partially offset by higher salaries, due to annual salary reviews, and higher business development expenses.

In addition, full year 2014 operating expenses included $3 million restructuring costs relating to the Operational Improvement Program.

Operating margin

Operating margin in North America was 17.5 percent in 2014 compared with 15.6 percent in 2013 driven by solid commissions and fees growth and expense reduction discussed above.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Willis International

Our International business comprised our retail operations in Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Asia, Australasia, the Middle East, South Africa and Latin America. The services provided are focused according to the characteristics of each market and vary across offices, but generally include direct risk management and insurance brokerage and employee benefits consulting.

The following table sets out revenues, operating income, organic commissions and fees growth and operating margin for the three years ended December 31, 2015 (in millions, except percentages):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(a) Commissions and fees in 2013 included a negative $15 million adjustment to align the recognition of revenue in China with the rest of the Group.

(b) Organic commissions and fees growth excludes: (i) the impact of foreign currency translation; (ii) the first twelve months of net commission and fee revenues generated from acquisitions; and (iii) the net commission and fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each period presented.

(c) Percentages may differ due to rounding.

2015 compared to 2014 

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $1,063 million were $25 million, or 2.4 percent, higher in 2015 compared with 2014. 

Organic commissions and fees growth, which excludes a 13.5 percent net favorable impact from acquisitions and disposals, partially offset by an 18.7 percent adverse impact from foreign currency movements, was 7.6 percent.

The 7.6 percent organic growth in commissions and fees included strong double-digit growth in Latin America, mid-single digit growth in Western Europe and strong single-digit growth in Asia.

The 13.5 percent favorable impact from acquisitions and disposals was primarily due to the acquisition of Max Matthiessen in the fourth quarter of 2014. 

The 18.7 percent adverse impact from foreign currency movements was due to the weakening of a number of currencies versus the US dollar.

Expenses

Total expenses of $903 million were $54 million, or 6.4 percent, higher for 2015 compared with 2014. 

Organic total expenses, which exclude a $105 million increase due to acquisitions and disposals, a $21 million increase in restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program and a $10 million increase in M&A transaction-related costs, primarily due to the acquisition of Gras Savoye, partially offset by $127 million of favorable foreign currency movements, increased $45 million, or 6.3 percent, compared with 2014.

The $45 million, or 6.3 percent, increase in organic total expenses was due to investments in growth businesses and increased salaries and benefits from annual pay reviews, including mandatory pay rises in many Latin American countries.

The favorable foreign currency movements were primarily due to the weakening of multiple currencies against the US dollar.

See the ‘Operational Improvement Program’ section above for further details of the restructuring costs.

Willis Towers Watson plc

Operating margin

Operating margin was 15.4 percent in 2015, down 330 basis points from 18.7 percent in 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements, and restructuring expenses incurred under the Operational Improvement Program, the International division achieved strong operating income growth and margin improvement.

2014 compared to 2013 

Revenues

Commissions and fees of $1,038 million were $90 million, or 9.5 percent, higher in 2014 compared with 2013. 

Organic commissions and fees growth was 8.8 percent and there was a 5.6 percent positive impact from the acquisition of Charles Monat in second quarter 2014, and Max Matthiessen in fourth quarter 2014. This was partially offset by a 4.9 percent negative impact from foreign currency movements which was driven by the weakening of a basket of currencies versus the US dollar.

Organic growth included double-digit new business growth and a positive impact from rates, partly offset by lost business. Growth was positively impacted by the non-recurrence of an adjustment recorded in 2013 to align the recognition of revenue in China with the rest of the Group.

Western Europe reported mid single-digit growth driven by Iberia, Germany, Denmark and Ireland. 

Latin America reported double-digit growth arising primarily from Brazil and Venezuela which was partially offset by decline in Colombia.

Double digit growth in Asia was primarily due to the non-recurrence of an adjustment recorded in 2013 to align the recognition of revenue in China with the rest of the Group. 

Eastern Europe reported low double digit growth arising primarily from Russia and Poland.

Expenses

Total expenses of $849 million were $75 million, or 9.7 percent, higher for 2014 compared with 2013. Foreign currency movements favorably impacted expenses by $28 million or 4.1 percent; excluding the impact of foreign currency movements total expenses increased $103 million or 13.8 percent. 

The $103 million increase in total expenses included $44 million year-over-year net increase from acquisitions, increased growth in Salaries and benefits due to higher headcount numbers relative to the prior year, and pay reviews which included the mandated pay reviews in Latin America. The segment also reported an increase in travel, accommodation and entertaining, professional fees and irrecoverable VAT. This was partially offset by the $3 million gain on disposal of fixed assets and an E&O provision release. 

The amortization of intangible assets increased following the acquisition of Charles Monat and Max Matthiessen. 

In addition, the year-on-year growth included $5 million restructuring costs relating the Operational Improvement Program.

Operating margin

Operating margin in International was 18.7 percent in 2014, compared with 19.0 percent in 2013. The decrease was driven by the increase in expenses discussed above partially offset by solid commissions and fees growth.

(a) See ‘Operational Improvement Program’ section above. 

2015 compared to 2014 

Expenses

Corporate and Other expenses of $226 million were $74 million higher in 2015 compared with 2014.

The $74 million growth included a $70 million increase in litigation provision, for loss contingencies relating to the Stanford litigation, and a $58 million increase in M&A transaction-related costs, primarily due to the merger with Towers Watson, partially offset by a $57 million increase in the gain from non-servicing elements of defined benefit pensions, including the effect of the UK defined benefit pension plan salary freeze.

2014 compared to 2013 

Expenses

Corporate and Other expenses of $152 million were $28 million higher in 2014 compared with 2013.

The $28 million growth included a $69 million increase due to higher costs of group functions including projects, leadership and increased professional fees and the adverse impact of changes to the methodology used to allocate Corporate function costs to Willis GB, Willis CWR, Willis North America and Willis International. In addition to this, Corporate recognized $17 million of restructuring costs related to the Operational Improvement Program. 

These increases were partially offset by the non-recurrence of 2013 Expense Reduction Initiative costs of $46 million, $1 million of fees related to the extinguishment of debt and $4 million of favorable foreign exchange movements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Our Legacy Willis accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management considers that the following accounting estimates or assumptions are the most important to the presentation of our financial condition or operating performance:

•pension expense (discount rates, expected asset returns and mortality);

•intangible assets and goodwill impairment (determination of reporting units, fair value of reporting units and annual goodwill impairment analysis);

•income taxes; and

•commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities.

Management has discussed its critical accounting estimates and associated disclosures with our Audit Committee.

Legacy Willis pension expense

We maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in the US and UK. Both of these plans are now closed to new entrants and, with effect from May 15, 2009 we closed our US defined benefit plan to future accrual. New employees in the UK are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan and in the US are offered the opportunity to join a 401(k) plan. On June 30, 2015, we implemented a salary freeze for our UK defined benefit pension plan. We also have several smaller defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries in which we operate, including a non-qualified plan in the US and an unfunded plan in the UK. These smaller defined benefit plans have combined total assets of $342 million and a combined net liability for pension benefits of $60 million as of December 31, 2015. Elsewhere, pension benefits are typically provided through defined contribution plans.

We recorded a $75 million and a $6 million net periodic benefit income on our UK and US defined benefit pension schemes respectively in 2015, compared with a net periodic benefit income of $13 million on the UK scheme and a net periodic benefit income of $8 million on the US scheme in 2014. On our international defined benefit pension plans, US non-qualified plan and UK unfunded plan, we recorded a net periodic benefit cost of $3 million in 2015, compared with $4 million in 2014.

Based on December 31, 2015 assumptions, as updated for the ‘spot rate’ approach to determining service cost and interest cost with effect from January 1, 2016, we expect the net pension credit in 2016 will remain broadly flat for the UK plan despite the benefit from adopting the spot rate approach of approximately $12 million. The net pension credit will increase by $2 million for the US plan despite the approximate $6 million benefit from adopting the spot rate approach and the net pension charge will remain unchanged at $3 million for the other plans. 

We make a number of assumptions when determining our pension liabilities and pension expense which are reviewed annually by senior management and changed where appropriate. The discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved whereas the expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer term trends in asset returns emerge or long term target asset allocations are revised. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, the expected long-term rate of compensation and pension increases and rates of employee termination. Our approach to determining appropriate assumptions for our UK and US pension plans is set out below.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Discount rate

During 2015 we continued to use a duration-based approach, which more closely matches the actual timing of expected cash flows to the applicable discount rate. The selected rate used to discount UK plan liabilities in 2015 was 3.80%, an increase of 20 basis points from the discount rate of 3.60% used at December 31, 2014. During 2015, sterling high-quality corporate bond yields rose slightly at almost all durations. Consequently, the rate consistent with the expected maturity of the plan’s liabilities has also increased.

Expected and actual asset returns

Expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are developed from the expected future returns of the various asset classes using the target asset allocations. As part of the salary freeze negotiations with the Scheme Trustee, we agreed to the Trustee’s de-risking strategy which will lead to a strategic target asset allocation with a greater weighting to fixed income assets. Consequently, with effect from March 6, 2015, the expected return on assets assumption was reduced by 50 basis points from 7.00% to 6.50%. The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net UK pension expense was equivalent to an expected return in 2015 of $222 million (2014: $213 million). 

 There have been no further changes to the strategic target asset allocation therefore, management considers that 6.50% continues to be an appropriate long-term rate of return assumption.

The expected and actual returns on UK plan assets for the three years ended December 31, 2015 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Mortality

The mortality assumption chosen should reflect the long term life expectancy of pension scheme members and represent the best estimate assumptions used as opposed to more prudent assumption used by pension scheme trustees for funding purposes.

At December 31, 2014, the Company updated the mortality assumption based on analysis carried out by the Scheme Actuary for the December 31, 2013 funding valuation. However, to reflect Scheme experience, we adjusted the base tables such that there is no change in the overall strength of the assumption. For 2015, we have continued with the same assumption and, as a result, the liabilities are unchanged. 

As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a UK male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2015 would have a life expectancy of 24 years.

Legacy Willis US plan

Willis Towers Watson plc

Discount rate

The discount rate at December 31, 2015 was 4.19%, an increase of 29 basis points from the discount rate of 3.90% at December 31, 2014. The increase in the discount rate reflects the modest increase in high-quality corporate bond yields during 2015. 

Expected and actual asset returns

The expected long-term rate of return used for determining the net US pension scheme expense in 2015 was 7.25% (2014: 7.25%) 

The expected and actual returns on US plan assets for the three years ended December 31, 2015 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Mortality

At December 31, 2015, the mortality table was changed from the RP-2014 Mortality table projected using MP-2014 improvement scale on a fully generational basis (which was used at December 31, 2014) to the RP-2014 Mortality table (rolled back to 2006 using MP-2014) projected using Towers Watson BB-2D adjusted improvement scale on a fully generational basis. 

The impact of this change decreased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $55 million. 

As an indication of the longevity assumed, our calculations assume that a US male retiree aged 65 at December 31, 2015, would have a life expectancy of 20 years.

Legacy Willis goodwill impairment review

We test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred.

Application of the impairment test involves the use of discounted cash flow models and requires significant judgment, including: 

•the identification of reporting units; 

•projections of commission and fee and expense growth rates;

•discount and terminal growth rates;

•assignment of assets, liabilities and goodwill to reporting units; and 

•determination of fair value of each reporting unit.

We use comparable market earnings multiple data and our Company’s market capitalization to corroborate our reporting unit valuations.

Our annual goodwill impairment analysis is performed each year at October 1. At October 1, 2015 our analysis showed the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was significantly in excess of carrying value, and therefore did not result in an impairment charge (2014: $nil; 2013: $nil).

Legacy Willis income taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We estimate deferred tax assets and liabilities and assess the need for any valuation allowances using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled taking into account our business plans and tax planning strategies.

84
Management’s Discussion and Analysis

At December 31, 2015, we had gross deferred tax assets of $486 million (2014: $426 million) against which a valuation allowance of $187 million (2014: $280 million) had been recognized. To the extent that:

•the actual amount or character of future taxable income differs from our current projections in the periods;

•identified prudent and feasible tax planning strategies fail to materialize;

•new tax planning strategies are developed; or

•material changes occur in actual tax rates or loss carry-forward time limits,

we may adjust the deferred tax asset considered realizable in future periods. Such adjustments could result in a significant increase or decrease in the effective tax rate and have a material impact on our net income.

Considering our recent US earnings experience and projections of future income, a possibility exists that we may release a portion of the valuation allowance against our US deferred tax assets in the next twelve months. Release of the US valuation allowance would result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. Our US valuation allowance, excluding that related to state separate taxes, is $69 million as at December 31, 2015. The exact timing and amount of future valuation release is subject to change on the basis of the level of profitability we are able to achieve.

Positions taken in our tax returns may be subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination. We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities. The benefit recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized on settlement with the tax authority, assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. 

The Company adjusts its recognition of these uncertain tax benefits in the period in which new information is available impacting either the recognition or measurement of its uncertain tax positions. In 2015, there was a net increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $3 million compared to a net decrease of $22 million in 2014. The Company recognizes interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties within income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheet.

Legacy Willis commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities

We have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice. In certain cases, where a range of loss exists, we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount.

In addition, the accounting standards require us to take into account a variety of factors with respect to loss contingencies. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we accrued $70 million, before tax, in connection with the litigation related to the Stanford Financial Group. We continue to dispute the allegations and to defend ourselves vigorously. See Part I, Item 3 - ‘Legal Proceedings’ of this Form 10-K.

Mandatory repayments of debt over the next 12 months include expiration of the 1-year term loan facility expiring 2016, maturity of the 4.125% senior notes due 2016 and the scheduled repayment of the current portion of the Company’s 7-year term loan. The Company also has the right, at its option, to prepay indebtedness under the credit facility without further penalty and to redeem the senior notes by paying a ‘make-whole’ premium as provided under the applicable debt instrument.

Operating leases

The Company leases certain land, buildings and equipment under various operating lease arrangements. Original non-cancellable lease terms typically are between 10 and 20 years and may contain escalation clauses, along with options that permit early withdrawal. The total amount of the minimum rent is expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

86
Management’s Discussion and Analysis

Information regarding these operating leases and their impact on the financial statements is set forth in Note 20 - ‘Commitments and Contingencies’ to the Consolidated Financial Statements appearing under Part II, Item 8 of this report and incorporated herein by reference.

Pensions

Contractual obligations for the Company’s pension plans reflect the contributions the Company expects to make over the next five years into the Legacy Willis US, UK and Other defined benefit plans. These contributions are based on current funding positions and may increase or decrease dependent on the future performance of the plans.

Total contributions made in 2015 and 2014, and the contributions we expect to make in 2016, in respect of the Legacy Willis UK, US and Other defined benefit pension schemes are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Included in the Legacy Willis UK plan contributions, above, are deficit funding contributions expected in 2016 of $53 million (2015: $54 million and 2014: $59 million), on-going contributions of approximately $22 million (2015: $19 million and 2014: $22 million) and contingent contributions of approximately $8 million following share buybacks made (2015: $21 million and 2014: $nil).

Additionally, during 2015 $9 million (2014: $10 million) was paid into the Legacy Willis UK plan in respect of employees’ salary sacrifice contributions.

UK plan

On December 31, 2015, Legacy Willis agreed a revised schedule of contributions towards on-going accrual of benefits and deficit funding contributions the Company will make to the UK Plan to the end of 2024. Based on this agreement, deficit funding contributions in 2016 will total approximately $53 million. 

Annual deficit funding contributions will reduce to approximately $22 million for 2017 through 2020 although additional ‘funding level’ contributions may become payable based on funding level assessments made between December 31, 2017 and 2024. Such annual funding level contributions are capped at approximately $15 million. From 2021 annual deficit funding contributions may be ceased, and instead paid into escrow, if the Scheme is ahead of its funding plan.
