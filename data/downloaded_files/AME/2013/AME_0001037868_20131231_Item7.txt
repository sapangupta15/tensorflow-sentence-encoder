Business Overview  

AMETEKs operations are affected by global, regional and industry economic factors. However, the Companys strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to limit the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. In 2013, the Company established records for orders, sales, operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. Contributions from recent acquisitions, combined with successful Operational Excellence initiatives, had a positive impact on 2013 results. The Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEKs four growth strategies: Operational Excellence, New Product Development, Global and Market Expansion, and Strategic Acquisitions and Alliances. Highlights of 2013 were:  

       In 2013, net sales were $3.6 billion, an increase of $259.9 million or 7.8% from 2012, on contributions from the 2012 and 2013 acquisitions.  

       Net income for 2013 was $517.0 million, an increase of $57.9 million or 12.6%, compared with $459.1 million in 2012.  

       During 2013, the Company completed the following acquisitions:  

       In August 2013, the Company acquired Controls Southeast (CSI), a leader in custom-engineered, thermal management solutions used to maintain temperature control of liquid and gas in a broad range of demanding industrial process applications;  

       In October 2013 the Company acquired Creaform, Inc., a leading developer and manufacturer of innovative portable 3D measurement technologies and a provider of 3D engineering services; and  

       In December 2013, the Company acquired Powervar, Inc., a leading provider of power management systems and uninterruptible power supply systems.  

       Higher earnings resulted in record cash flow provided by operating activities that totaled $660.7 million for 2013, a $48.2 million or 7.9% increase from 2012.  

       The Company continues to maintain a strong international sales presence. International sales, including U.S. export sales, were $1,984.5 million or 55.2% of net sales in 2013, compared with $1,707.6 million or 51.2% of net sales in 2012.  

       New orders for 2013 were a record at $3,621.9 million, an increase of $86.8 million or 2.5%, compared with $3,535.1 million in 2012. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2013 was $1,140.0 million.

Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared with the year ended December 31, 2012  

In 2013, the Company established records for orders, sales, operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these results primarily through contributions from acquisitions completed in 2013 and the acquisitions of Dunkermotoren GmbH in May 2012, Micro-Poise Measurement Systems (Micro-Poise) in October 2012, Aero Components International (ACI), Avtech Avionics and Instruments (Avtech), Sunpower, Inc. and Crystal Engineering in December 2012, as well as our Operational Excellence initiatives. The full year impact of the 2013 acquisitions and our continued focus on and implementation of Operational Excellence initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on our 2014 results.  

Net sales for 2013 were $3,594.1 million, an increase of $259.9 million or 7.8%, compared with net sales of $3,334.2 million in 2012. Net sales for the Electronic Instruments Group (EIG) were $2,034.6 million in 2013, an increase of 8.7% from net sales of $1,872.6 million in 2012. Net sales for the Electromechanical Group (EMG) were $1,559.5 million in 2013, an increase of 6.7% from net sales of $1,461.7 million in 2012. The increase in net sales was attributable to higher order rates, as well as the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The net sales increase for 2013 included internal sales growth of approximately 2%. Foreign currency translation was flat period over period.

Total international sales for 2013 were $1,984.5 million or 55.2% of net sales, an increase of $276.9 million or 16.2%, compared with international sales of $1,707.6 million or 51.2% of net sales in 2012. The $276.9 million increase in international sales resulted from the acquisitions mentioned above, primarily driven by Dunkermotoren and Micro-Poise, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $1,037.0 million in 2013, an increase of $174.4 million or 20.2%, compared with $862.6 million in 2012. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from the 2013 and 2012 acquisitions noted above, excluding Creaform and Dunkermotoren.  

New orders for 2013 were a record at $3,621.9 million, an increase of $86.8 million or 2.5%, compared with $3,535.1 million in 2012. The increase in orders was primarily attributable to 2013 and 2012 acquisitions. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2013 was $1,140.0 million, an increase of $27.7 million or 2.5%, compared with $1,112.3 million at December 31, 2012.  

Segment operating income for 2013 was $861.5 million, an increase of $72.2 million or 9.1%, compared with segment operating income of $789.3 million in 2012. The increase in segment operating income resulted primarily from the acquisitions mentioned above, as well as the benefits of the Companys lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 24.0% in 2013, compared with 23.7% in 2012. The increase in segment operating margins resulted primarily from the benefits of the Companys lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.  

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for 2013 were $398.2 million, an increase of $17.7 million or 4.7%, compared with $380.5 million in 2012. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.1% for 2013, compared with 11.4% in 2012. Selling expenses increased $14.8 million or 4.4% for 2013 primarily driven by the increase in net sales noted above. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 9.8% for 2013, compared with 10.1% in 2012. Base business selling expenses decreased approximately 2% for 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to cost containment initiatives.  

Corporate administrative expenses for 2013 were $46.0 million, an increase of $2.9 million or 6.7%, compared with $43.1 million in 2012. The increase in corporate administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher consulting and professional fees. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.3% for both 2013 and 2012.  

Consolidated operating income was $815.1 million or 22.7% of net sales for 2013, an increase of $69.2 million or 9.3%, compared with $745.9 million or 22.4% of net sales in 2012.  

Interest expense was $73.6 million for 2013, a decrease of $1.9 million or 2.5%, compared with $75.5 million in 2012. The decrease was due to lower borrowings under revolving credit facilities.  

Other expenses, net were $16.7 million for 2013, an increase of $8.8 million, compared with $7.9 million in 2012. The increase was primarily driven by acquisition-related expenses and professional fees, and the unfavorable impact from foreign currency in 2013.  

The effective tax rate for 2013 was 28.7%, compared with 30.7% in 2012. The effective tax rate for 2013 reflects the higher proportion of foreign earnings, which are taxed at lower rates, as well as an improved state effective tax rate that reflects the ongoing benefit of favorable planning initiatives. In addition, the retroactive extension of the U.S. research and development (R&D) tax credit for calendar year 2012 was enacted on January 2, 2013, resulting in an incremental R&D tax credit in 2013. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  

Net income for 2013 was $517.0 million, an increase of $57.9 million or 12.6%, compared with $459.1 million in 2012. Diluted earnings per share for 2013 were $2.10, an increase of $0.22 or 11.7%, compared with $1.88 per diluted share in 2012.

Segment Results  

EIGs net sales totaled $2,034.6 million for 2013, an increase of $162.0 million or 8.7%, compared with $1,872.6 million in 2012. The net sales increase was driven by the acquisitions of Powervar, Creaform, CSI and Micro-Poise. Internal sales growth was approximately 2%, primarily driven by increases in EIGs process instruments businesses. Foreign currency translation was flat period over period.  

EIGs operating income was $552.1 million for 2013, an increase of $55.0 million or 11.1%, compared with $497.1 million in 2012. EIGs increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales mentioned above. EIGs operating margins were 27.1% of net sales for 2013, compared with 26.5% of net sales in 2012. EIGs increase in operating margins was primarily due to the Groups lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives. EIGs 2013 operating margins included a $11.6 million gain on the sale of a facility recorded in third quarter, which was partially offset by incremental growth investments in the businesses recorded in the third and fourth quarters.  

EMGs net sales totaled $1,559.5 million for 2013, an increase of $97.8 million or 6.7%, compared with $1,461.7 million in 2012. The net sales increase was driven by the acquisition of Dunkermotoren. Internal sales growth was approximately 1%, driven by EMGs floorcare and specialty motors businesses. Foreign currency translation was flat period over period.  

EMGs operating income was $309.4 million for 2013, an increase of $17.2 million or 5.9%, compared with $292.2 million in 2012. EMGs increase in operating income was primarily due to higher sales mentioned above. EMGs operating margins were 19.8% of net sales for 2013, compared with 20.0% of net sales in 2012. EMGs decrease in operating margins was driven by weaker performance in its differentiated businesses, including the impact of the Dunkermotoren acquisition, which has a lower operating margin than the Groups base businesses.  

Results of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 compared with the year ended December 31, 2011  

In 2012, the Company established records for orders, sales, operating income, operating income margins, net income, diluted earnings per share and operating cash flow. The Company achieved these results through contributions from acquisitions completed in 2012 and the acquisitions of Technical Manufacturing Corporation (TMC) in December 2011, EM Test (Switzerland) GmbH and Reichert Technologies in October 2011, Coining Holding Company (Coining) in May 2011 and Avicenna Technology, Inc. (Avicenna) in April 2011, as well as our Operational Excellence initiatives.  

Net sales for 2012 were $3,334.2 million, an increase of $344.3 million or 11.5%, compared with net sales of $2,989.9 million in 2011. Net sales for EIG were $1,872.6 million in 2012, an increase of 13.7% from net sales of $1,647.2 million in 2011. Net sales for EMG were $1,461.7 million in 2012, an increase of 8.9% from net sales of $1,342.7 million in 2011. The increase in net sales was attributable to higher order rates, as well as the impact of the acquisitions mentioned above. The net sales increase for 2012 included internal sales growth of approximately 1%, which excludes a 1% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation.  

Total international sales for 2012 were $1,707.6 million or 51.2% of net sales, an increase of $206.5 million or 13.8%, compared with international sales of $1,501.1 million or 50.2% of net sales in 2011. The $206.5 million increase in international sales resulted from the acquisitions mentioned above, primarily driven by Dunkermotoren, and includes the effect of foreign currency translation. Both reportable segments of the Company maintain strong international sales presences in Europe and Asia despite weakness in the global economy. Export shipments from the United States, which are included in total international sales, were $862.6 million in 2012, an increase of $87.7 million or 11.3%, compared with $774.9 million in 2011. Export shipments improved due to increased exports from the 2012 and 2011 acquisitions noted above, excluding Dunkermotoren and EM Test.

New orders for 2012 were a record at $3,535.1 million, an increase of $462.6 million or 15.1%, compared with $3,072.5 million in 2011. The increase in orders was primarily attributable to 2012 and 2011 acquisitions, excluding a 1% unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation. As a result, the Companys backlog of unfilled orders at December 31, 2012 was a record at $1,112.3 million, an increase of $200.9 million or 22.0%, compared with $911.4 million at December 31, 2011.  

Segment operating income for 2012 was $789.3 million, an increase of $106.4 million or 15.6%, compared with segment operating income of $682.9 million in 2011. Segment operating income, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 23.7% in 2012, compared with 22.8% in 2011. The increase in segment operating income and segment operating margins resulted primarily from the benefits of the Companys lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.  

SG&A expenses for 2012 were $380.5 million, an increase of $31.2 million or 8.9%, compared with $349.3 million in 2011. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 11.4% for 2012, compared with 11.7% in 2011. Selling expenses increased $34.7 million or 11.4% for 2012 primarily driven by the increase in net sales noted above. Selling expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 10.1% for both 2012 and 2011. Base business selling expenses were essentially flat year over year, which was in line with internal sales growth.  

Corporate administrative expenses for 2012 were $43.1 million, a decrease of $3.5 million or 7.5%, compared with $46.6 million in 2011. The decrease in corporate administrative expenses was primarily driven by lower consulting and compensation-related expenses. As a percentage of net sales, corporate administrative expenses were 1.3% for 2012, compared with 1.6% in 2011.  

Consolidated operating income was $745.9 million or 22.4% of net sales for 2012, an increase of $110.0 million or 17.3%, compared with $635.9 million or 21.3% of net sales in 2011.  

Interest expense was $75.5 million for 2012, an increase of $5.8 million or 8.3%, compared with $69.7 million in 2011. The increase was due to higher borrowings under revolving credit facilities and higher fees associated with the full year impact of the revolving credit facility signed in September 2011 primarily for the acquisitions previously mentioned, as well as the full year impact of the issuance of a 55 million Swiss franc senior note in the fourth quarter of 2011.  

Other expenses, net were $7.9 million for 2012, a decrease of $1.7 million, compared with $9.6 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily driven by higher investment income, a favorable impact from foreign currency in 2012 and the non-recurrence of costs incurred to demolish a vacant facility in 2011.  

The effective tax rate for 2012 was 30.7%, compared with 30.9% in 2011. The effective tax rate for 2012 and 2011 includes the impact of international statutory tax rate reductions and the ongoing benefits obtained from international tax planning initiatives. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  

Net income for 2012 was $459.1 million, an increase of $74.6 million or 19.4%, compared with $384.5 million in 2011. Diluted earnings per share for 2012 were $1.88, an increase of $0.30 or 19.0%, compared with $1.58 per diluted share in 2011.  

Segment Results  

EIGs net sales totaled $1,872.6 million for 2012, an increase of $225.4 million or 13.7%, compared with $1,647.2 million in 2011. The net sales increase was due to internal sales growth of approximately 3%, excluding an unfavorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation, primarily driven by increases in EIGs oil and gas, aerospace and power businesses. The acquisitions of Micro-Poise, OBrien, TMC, EM Test and Reichert Technologies accounted for the remainder of the net sales increase.

Table of Contents 

EIGs operating income was $497.1 million for 2012, an increase of $76.9 million or 18.3%, compared with $420.2 million in 2011. EIGs operating margins were 26.5% of net sales for 2012, compared with 25.5% of net sales in 2011. The increase in segment operating income and operating margins was driven by the leveraged impact of the Groups increase in internal sales growth noted above, as well as the benefit of the Groups lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.  

EMGs net sales totaled $1,461.7 million for 2012, an increase of $119.0 million or 8.9%, compared with $1,342.7 million in 2011. The net sales increase was due to the acquisitions of Dunkermotoren, Coining and Avicenna, partially offset by an internal sales decline of 1% and an unfavorable 1% effect of foreign currency translation.  

EMGs operating income was $292.2 million for 2012, an increase of $29.5 million or 11.2%, compared with $262.7 million in 2011. EMGs operating margins were 20.0% of net sales for 2012, compared with 19.6% of net sales in 2011. EMGs increase in operating income and operating margins was primarily due to the benefit of the Groups lower cost structure through Operational Excellence initiatives.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Cash provided by operating activities totaled $660.7 million in 2013, an increase of $48.2 million or 7.9%, compared with $612.5 million in 2012. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the $57.9 million increase in net income. Free cash flow (cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures) was $597.4 million in 2013, compared with $555.1 million in 2012. EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) was $916.3 million in 2013, compared with $842.7 million in 2012. Free cash flow and EBITDA are presented because the Company is aware that they are measures used by third parties in evaluating the Company. (See the Notes to Selected Financial Data included in Item 6 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a reconciliation of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) measures to comparable non-GAAP measures).

At December 31, 2013, $92.4 million was available under the Board authorization for future share repurchases.  

The Company has a revolving credit facility with a total borrowing capacity of $700 million, which excludes an accordion feature that permits the Company to request up to an additional $200 million in revolving credit commitments at any time during the life of the revolving credit agreement under certain conditions. The revolving credit facility was amended in December 2013 and now expires in December 2018. Interest rates on outstanding loans under the revolving credit facility are at the applicable benchmark rate plus a negotiated spread or at the U.S. prime rate. The revolving credit facility provides the Company with additional financial flexibility to support its growth plans, including its successful acquisition strategy.

The Company is in compliance with all covenants, including financial covenants, for all of its debt agreements. The Company believes it has sufficient cash-generating capabilities from domestic and unrestricted foreign sources, available credit facilities and access to long-term capital funds to enable it to meet its operating needs and contractual obligations in the foreseeable future.  

The following table summarizes AMETEKs contractual cash obligations and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flows in future years at December 31, 2013.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  The liability for uncertain tax positions was not included in the table of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2013 because the timing of the settlements of these uncertain tax positions cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.  

 (2)  Includes the $450 million private placement completed in 2007 and the $350 million private placement completed in 2008.

 (3)  Although not contractually obligated, the Company expects to have the capability to repay the revolving credit loan within one year as permitted in the credit agreement. Accordingly, $268.3 million was classified as short-term debt at December 31, 2013.  

 (4)  Represents a capital lease for a building and land associated with the Cameca SAS acquisition. The lease has a term of 12 years, which began in July 2006, and is payable quarterly.  

 (5)  The leases expire over a range of years from 2014 to 2082 with renewal or purchase options, subject to various terms and conditions, contained in most of the leases.  

 (6)  Purchase obligations primarily consist of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.  

Other Commitments  

The Company has standby letters of credit and surety bonds of $51.3 million related to performance and payment guarantees at December 31, 2013. Based on experience with these arrangements, the Company believes that any obligations that may arise will not be material to its financial position.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

The Company has identified its critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the Companys financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. The consolidated financial statements and related notes contain information that is pertinent to the Companys accounting policies and to Managements Discussion and Analysis. The information that follows represents additional specific disclosures about the Companys accounting policies regarding risks, estimates, subjective decisions or assessments whereby materially different financial condition and results of operations could have been reported had different assumptions been used or different conditions existed. Primary disclosure of the Companys significant accounting policies is in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

       Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period when the sales process is complete. This generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with terms of an agreement of sale, under which title and risk of loss have been transferred, collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable. For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss passes at point of delivery, the Company recognizes revenue upon delivery to the customer, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition are met. The Companys policy, with respect to sales returns and allowances generally provides that the customer may not return products or be given allowances, except at the Companys option. The Company has agreements with distributors that do not provide expanded rights of return for unsold products. The distributor purchases the product from the Company, at which time title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor. The Company does not offer substantial sales incentives and credits to its distributors other than volume discounts. The Company accounts for the sales incentive as a reduction of revenues when the sale is recognized. Accruals for sales returns, other allowances and estimated warranty costs are provided at the time revenue is recognized based upon past experience. At December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $28.0 million, $27.8 million and $22.5 million, respectively. The Companys expense for warranty obligations was $8.6 million, $10.1 million and $13.2 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The warranty periods for products sold vary widely among the Companys operations, but for the most part do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on past warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. If actual future sales returns and allowances and warranty amounts are higher than past experience, additional accruals may be required.

       Accounts Receivable. The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of specific customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. A specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against the amount due from these customers. For all other customers, the Company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time specific receivables are past due based on its historical experience. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. The allowance for possible losses on receivables was $9.5 million and $10.8 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  

       Inventories. The Company uses the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method of accounting, which approximates current replacement cost, for approximately 80% of its inventories at December 31, 2013. The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting is used to determine cost for the remaining 20% of its inventory at December 31, 2013. For inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the FIFO value would have been $23.3 million and $25.4 million higher than the LIFO value reported in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives. If these factors are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory reserves may be required.  

       Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of the goodwill impairment test, the Company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units. The Company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and went directly to performing the first step quantitative analysis of the goodwill impairment test in the current year. The Company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. The first step in the quantitative process is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, then the second step must be completed, which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability, with the excess being implied goodwill. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The Company would be required to record any such impairment losses.  

The Company identifies its reporting units at the component level, which is one level below our operating segments. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. Our reporting units are composed of the business units one level below our operating segment at which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.  

The Company principally relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The Company believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based upon the Companys long-range plan. The Companys long-range plan is updated as part of its annual planning process and is reviewed and approved by management. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While  

30  

Table of Contents 

 there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the Companys overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment test to changes in the fair value calculations, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease in fair values of each reporting unit. The 2013 results (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) showed that, despite the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value, the fair values of the Companys reporting units still exceeded their respective carrying values by 1% to 555% for each of the Companys reporting units.  

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets. The Company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen. The Company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.  

The Companys acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2013, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $2,864.3 million or 48.7% of the Companys total assets. The Company performed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2013 and determined that the Companys goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles were not impaired. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.  

Other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from those assets are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of those assets. Fair market value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.  

       Pensions. The Company has U.S. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The most significant elements in determining the Companys pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each year, the Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2013, the Company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. The discount rate used in determining the 2013 pension cost was 4.1% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 4.44% for foreign plans. The discount rate used for determining the funded status of the plans at December 31, 2013 and determining the 2014 defined benefit pension cost was 5.0% for U.S. plans and 4.38% for foreign plans. In estimating the U.S. and foreign discount rates, the Companys actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. The Company used an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2013 of 7.75% for U.S. defined benefit pension plans and 6.91% for foreign plans. In 2014, the Company will use 7.75% for the U.S. plans and 6.93% for the foreign plans. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income and equity investments, and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate. The rate of compensation increase used in determining the 2013 pension expense for the  

31  

Table of Contents 

     U.S. plans was 3.75% and was 2.89% for the foreign plans. The U.S. rate of compensation increase will remain unchanged in 2014. The foreign plans rates of compensation increase will increase slightly to 2.92% in 2014. In 2013, the Company recognized consolidated pre-tax pension expense of $0.8 million from its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans, compared with pre-tax pension expense of $2.3 million recognized for these plans in 2012. The Company estimates its 2014 U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension pre-tax income to be approximately $10.6 million.  

All unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. The Company uses a December 31 measurement date (the date at which plan assets and benefit obligations are measured) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit plans.  

To fund the plans, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2013, which totaled $5.9 million, compared with $4.3 million in 2012. The Company anticipates making approximately $4 million to $7 million in cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in 2014.  

       Income Taxes. The process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Companys tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Companys tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.  

The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Companys forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the Companys deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.  

The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2012-02, Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment (ASU 2012-02). The amendments in ASU 2012-02, similar to the amendments of ASU No. 2011-08, Testing Goodwill for Impairment, permit an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test described in FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, Intangibles  Goodwill and Other. ASU 2012-02 was effective on January 1, 2013 for the Company and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02). ASU 2013-02 requires an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, an entity is required to present, either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period. For other amounts that are not required under U.S. GAAP to be reclassified in their entirety to net income, an entity is required to cross-reference to other disclosures required under U.S. GAAP that provide additional detail about those amounts. ASU 2013-02 was effective on January 1, 2013 for the Company. See the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the Companys disclosure reflecting these requirements.  

In March 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-05, Parents Accounting for the Cumulative Translation Adjustment upon Derecognition of Certain Subsidiaries or Groups of Assets within a Foreign Entity or of an Investment in a Foreign Entity (ASU 2013-05). ASU 2013-05 provides guidance for the treatment of the cumulative translation adjustment when an entity ceases to hold a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity. ASU 2013-05 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2013-05 to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  

In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-11, Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists (ASU 2013-11). ASU 2013-11 provides guidance for the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. ASU 2013-11 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2013, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2013-11 to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statement presentation.  

Internal Reinvestment  

Capital Expenditures  

Capital expenditures were $63.3 million or 1.8% of net sales in 2013, compared with $57.4 million or 1.7% of net sales in 2012. In 2013, 57% of the expenditures were for improvements to existing equipment or additional equipment to increase productivity and expand capacity. The Companys 2013 capital expenditures increased due to a continuing emphasis on spending to improve productivity and expand manufacturing capabilities. Capital expenditures in 2014 are expected to approximate 1.8% of net sales, with a continued emphasis on spending to improve productivity.  

Development and Engineering  

The Company is committed to research, development and engineering activities that are designed to identify and develop potential new and improved products or enhance existing products. Research, development and engineering costs before customer reimbursement were $178.7 million, $154.8 million and $137.6 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Customer reimbursements in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $9.2 million, $5.0 million and $6.1 million, respectively. These amounts included net Company-funded research and development expenses of $93.9 million, $84.9 million and $78.0 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. All such expenditures were directed toward the development of new products and processes and the improvement of existing products and processes.  

Environmental Matters  

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. The Company believes these waste products  

33  

Table of Contents 

 were handled in compliance with regulations existing at that time. At December 31, 2013, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) at 15 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the non-owned sites). The Company is identified as a de minimis party in 13 of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. In nine of these sites, the Company has reached a tentative agreement on the cost of the de minimis settlement to satisfy its obligation and is awaiting executed agreements. The tentatively agreed-to settlement amounts are fully reserved. In the other four sites, the Company is continuing to investigate the accuracy of the alleged volume attributed to the Company as estimated by the parties primarily responsible for remedial activity at the sites to establish an appropriate settlement amount. At the two remaining sites where the Company is a non-de minimis PRP, the Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group or investigating the PRP claim and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Companys expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the owned sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the low end of the range. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Companys liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.  

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2013 and 2012 were $21.9 million and $23.6 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2013, the Company recorded $1.6 million in reserves. Additionally, the Company spent $3.3 million on environmental matters in 2013. The Companys reserves for environmental liabilities at December 31, 2013 and 2012 include reserves of $13.3 million and $14.7 million, respectively, for an owned site acquired in connection with the 2005 acquisition of HCC Industries (HCC). The Company is the designated performing party for the performance of remedial activities for one of several operating units making up a Superfund site in the San Gabriel Valley of California. The Company has obtained indemnifications and other financial assurances from the former owners of HCC related to the costs of the required remedial activities. At December 31, 2013, the Company had $11.3 million in receivables related to HCC for probable recoveries from third-party escrow funds and other committed third-party funds to support the required remediation. Also, the Company is indemnified by HCCs former owners for approximately $19.0 million of additional costs.  

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters. To date, these parties have met their obligations in all material respects.  

The Company believes it has established reserves which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. The Company has no reason to believe that other third parties would fail to perform their obligations in the future. In the opinion of management, based upon presently available information and past experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Market Risk  

The Companys primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Companys differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole.  

The Companys short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. These financial instruments are more fully described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese Yen, the Chinese renminbi, the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign country affected. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.  

The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel, titanium and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.  

Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the Companys best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.  

Forward-Looking Information  

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K are forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Companys operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Companys actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important factors, in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the Companys actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.
