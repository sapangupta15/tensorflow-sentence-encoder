PART I   

  Item 1.    Business     

 Introduction   

 Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. On May 7, 1999, we converted from a partnership to a corporation and completed an initial public offering of our common stock. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Group Inc.) is a bank holding company and a financial holding company regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act). Our depository institution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank USA), is a New York State-chartered bank.  

 Our activities are divided into three segments: (i) Investment Banking, (ii) Trading and Principal Investments and (iii) Asset Management and Securities Services.  

 All references to 2009, 2008 and 2007 refer to our fiscal years ended, or the dates, as the context requires, December 31, 2009, November 28, 2008 and November 30, 2007, respectively. When we use the terms Goldman Sachs, the firm, we, us and our, we mean Group Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries. References herein to this Annual Report on Form 10-K are to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009.  

 In connection with becoming a bank holding company, the firm was required to change its fiscal year-end from November to December. This change in the firms fiscal year-end resulted in a one-month transition period that began on November 29, 2008 and ended on December 26, 2008. Financial information for this fiscal transition period is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In April 2009, the Board of Directors of Group Inc. approved a change in the firms fiscal year-end from the last Friday of December to December 31. Fiscal 2009 began on December 27, 2008 and ended on December 31, 2009.  

 Financial information concerning our business segments and geographic regions for each of 2009, 2008 and 2007 is set forth in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, and the supplemental financial information, which are in Part II, Items 7, 7A and 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Cautionary Statement Pursuant to the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995   

 We have included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and from time to time our management may make, statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside our control. These statements include statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and may relate to our future plans and objectives and results, among other things, and may also include our belief regarding the effect of various legal proceedings, as set forth under Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as statements about the objectives and effectiveness of our risk management and liquidity policies, statements about trends in or growth opportunities for our businesses, statements about our future status, activities or reporting under U.S. or non-U.S. banking and financial regulation, and statements about our investment banking transaction backlog. By identifying these statements for you in this manner, we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, those discussed below and under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

 In the case of statements about our investment banking transaction backlog, such statements are subject to the risk that the terms of these transactions may be modified or that they may not be completed at all; therefore, the net revenues, if any, that we actually earn from these transactions may differ, possibly materially, from those currently expected. Important factors that could result in a modification of the terms of a transaction or a transaction not being completed include, in the case of underwriting transactions, a decline or continued weakness in general economic conditions, outbreak of hostilities, volatility in the securities markets generally or an adverse development with respect to the issuer of the securities and, in the case of financial advisory transactions, a decline in the securities markets, an inability to obtain adequate financing, an adverse development with respect to a party to the transaction or a failure to obtain a required regulatory approval. For a discussion of other important factors that could adversely affect our investment banking transactions, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Investment Banking  

 Investment Banking represented 11% of 2009 net revenues. We provide a broad range of investment banking services to a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, investment funds, governments and individuals and seek to develop and maintain long-term relationships with these clients as their lead investment bank.  

 Our current structure, which is organized by regional, industry and product groups, seeks to combine client-focused investment bankers with execution and industry expertise. We continually assess and adapt our organization to meet the demands of our clients in each geographic region. Through our commitment to teamwork, we believe that we provide services in an integrated fashion for the benefit of our clients.  

 Our goal is to make available to our clients the entire resources of the firm in a seamless fashion, with investment banking serving as front of the house. To accomplish this objective, we focus on coordination among our equity and debt underwriting activities and our corporate risk and liability management activities. This coordination is intended to assist our investment banking clients in managing their asset and liability exposures and their capital.  

 Our Investment Banking segment is divided into two components: Financial Advisory and Underwriting.  

 Financial Advisory  

 Financial Advisory includes advisory assignments with respect to mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, corporate defense activities, restructurings and spin-offs. Our mergers and acquisitions capabilities are evidenced by our significant share of assignments in large, complex transactions for which we provide multiple services, including one-stop acquisition financing and cross-border structuring expertise, as well as services in other areas of the firm, such as interest rate and currency hedging. In particular, a significant number of the loan commitments and bank and bridge loan facilities that we enter into arise in connection with our advisory assignments.  

 Underwriting  

 Underwriting includes public offerings and private placements of a wide range of securities and other financial instruments, including common and preferred stock, convertible and exchangeable securities, investment-grade debt, high-yield debt, sovereign and emerging market debt, municipal debt, bank loans, asset-backed securities and real estate-related securities, such as mortgage-related securities and the securities of real estate investment trusts.  

 Equity Underwriting. Equity underwriting has been a long-term core strength of Goldman Sachs. As with mergers and acquisitions, we have been particularly successful in winning mandates for large, complex transactions. We believe our leadership in worldwide initial public offerings and worldwide public common stock offerings reflects our expertise in complex transactions, prior experience and distribution capabilities.  

 Debt Underwriting. We engage in the underwriting and origination of various types of debt instruments, including investment-grade debt securities, high-yield debt securities, bank and bridge loans and emerging market debt securities, which may be issued by, among others, corporate, sovereign and agency issuers. In addition, we underwrite and originate structured securities, which include mortgage-related securities and other asset-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations.   

 6  
 Trading and Principal Investments  

 Trading and Principal Investments represented 76% of 2009 net revenues. Trading and Principal Investments facilitates client transactions with a diverse group of corporations, financial institutions, investment funds, governments and individuals through market making in, trading of and investing in fixed income and equity products, currencies, commodities and derivatives on these products. We also take proprietary positions on certain of these products. In addition, we engage in market-making activities on equities and options exchanges, and we clear client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide. In connection with our merchant banking and other investing activities, we make principal investments directly and through funds that we raise and manage.  

 To meet the needs of our clients, Trading and Principal Investments is diversified across a wide range of products. We believe our willingness and ability to take risk to facilitate client transactions distinguishes us from many of our competitors and substantially enhances our client relationships.  

 Our Trading and Principal Investments segment is divided into three components: Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities; Equities; and Principal Investments.  

 Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities and Equities  

 Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities are large and diversified operations through which we assist clients with their investing and trading strategies and also engage in proprietary trading and investing activities.  

 In our client-driven businesses, FICC and Equities strive to deliver high-quality service by offering broad market-making and market knowledge to our clients on a global basis. In addition, we use our expertise to take positions in markets, by committing capital and taking risk, to facilitate client transactions and to provide liquidity. Our willingness to make markets, commit capital and take risk in a broad range of fixed income, currency, commodity and equity products and their derivatives is crucial to our client relationships and to support our underwriting business by providing secondary market liquidity.  

 We generate trading net revenues from our client-driven businesses in three ways:  

       First, in large, highly liquid markets, we undertake a high volume of transactions for modest spreads and fees.   

       Second, by capitalizing on our strong relationships and capital position, we undertake transactions in less liquid markets where spreads and fees are generally larger.   

       Finally, we structure and execute transactions that address complex client needs.    

 Our FICC and Equities businesses operate in close coordination to provide clients with services and cross-market knowledge and expertise.  

 In our proprietary activities in both FICC and Equities, we assume a variety of risks and devote resources to identify, analyze and benefit from these exposures. We capitalize on our analytical models to analyze information and make informed trading judgments, and we seek to benefit from perceived disparities in the value of assets in the trading markets and from macroeconomic and issuer-specific trends.  

 FICC  

 We make markets in and trade interest rate and credit products, mortgage-related securities and loan products and other asset-backed instruments, currencies and commodities, structure and enter into a wide variety of derivative transactions, and engage in proprietary trading and investing. FICC has five principal businesses: commodities; credit products; currencies; interest rate products, including money market instruments; and mortgage-related securities and loan products and other asset-backed instruments.   

 7  
 Commodities. We make markets in and trade a wide variety of commodities, commodity derivatives and interests in commodity-related assets, including oil and oil products, metals, natural gas and electricity, coal and agricultural products. As part of our commodities business, we acquire and dispose of interests in, and engage in the development and operation of, electric power generation facilities and related activities.  

 Credit Products. We make markets in and trade a broad array of credit and credit-linked products all over the world, including credit derivatives, investment-grade corporate securities, high-yield securities, bank and secured loans (origination and trading), municipal securities, and emerging market and distressed debt. For example, we enter, as principal, into complex structured transactions designed to meet client needs.  

 In addition, we provide credit through bridge and other loan facilities to a broad range of clients. Commitments that are extended for contingent acquisition financing are often intended to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other funding sources. As part of our ongoing credit origination activities, we may seek to reduce our credit risk on commitments by syndicating all or substantial portions of commitments to other investors or, upon funding, by securitizing the positions through investment vehicles sold to other investors. Underwriting fees from syndications of these commitments are recorded in debt underwriting in our Investment Banking segment. However, to the extent that we recognize losses on these commitments, such losses are recorded within our Trading and Principal Investments segment, net of any related underwriting fees. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our commitments.  

 Our credit products business includes making significant long-term and short-term investments for our own account (sometimes investing together with our merchant banking funds) in a broad array of asset classes (including distressed debt) globally. We opportunistically invest in debt and equity securities and secured loans, and in private equity, real estate and other assets.  

 Currencies. We act as a dealer in foreign exchange and trade in most currencies on exchanges and in cash and derivative markets globally.  

 Interest Rate Products. We make markets in and trade a variety of interest rate products, including interest rate swaps, options and other derivatives, and government bonds, as well as money market instruments, such as commercial paper, treasury bills, repurchase agreements and other highly liquid securities and instruments. This business includes our matched book, which consists of short-term collateralized financing transactions.  

 Mortgage Business. We make markets in and trade commercial and residential mortgage-related securities and loan products and other asset-backed and derivative instruments. We acquire positions in these products for trading purposes as well as for securitization or syndication. We also originate and service commercial and residential mortgages.  

 Equities  

 We make markets in and trade equities and equity-related products, structure and enter into equity derivative transactions, and engage in proprietary trading. We generate commissions from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide through our Equities client franchise and clearing activities.  

 Equities includes two principal businesses: our client franchise business and principal strategies. We also engage in exchange-based market-making activities and in insurance activities.   

 8  
 Client Franchise Business. Our client franchise business includes primarily client-driven activities in the shares, equity derivatives and convertible securities markets. These activities also include clearing client transactions on major stock, options and futures exchanges worldwide, as well as our exchange-based options market-making business. Our client franchise business increasingly involves providing our clients with access to electronic low-touch equity trading platforms, and electronic trades account for the majority of our client trading activity in this business. However, a majority of our net revenues in this business continues to be derived from our traditional high-touch handling of more complex trades. We expect both types of trading activities to remain important components of our client franchise business.  

 We trade equity securities and equity-related products, including convertible securities, options, futures and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative instruments, on a global basis as an agent, as a market maker or otherwise as a principal. As a principal, we facilitate client transactions, often by committing capital and taking risk, to provide liquidity to clients with large blocks of stocks or options. For example, we are active in the execution of large block trades. We also execute transactions as agent and offer clients direct electronic access to trading markets.  

 Our derivatives business structures and executes derivatives on indices, industry groups, financial measures and individual company stocks. We develop strategies and provide information with respect to portfolio hedging and restructuring and asset allocation transactions. We also work with our clients to create specially tailored instruments to enable sophisticated investors to undertake hedging strategies and to establish or liquidate investment positions. We are one of the leading participants in the trading and development of equity derivative instruments. In listed options, we are registered as a primary or lead market maker or otherwise make markets on the International Securities Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, NYSE Arca, the Boston Options Exchange, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and NYSE Alternext US. In futures and options on futures, we are market makers on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade.  

 Principal Strategies. Our principal strategies business is a multi-strategy investment business that invests and trades our capital across global public markets. Investment strategies include fundamental equities and relative value trading (which involves trading strategies designed to take advantage of perceived discrepancies in the relative value of financial instruments, including equity, equity-related and debt instruments), event-driven investments (which focus on event-oriented special situations such as corporate restructurings, bankruptcies, recapitalizations, mergers and acquisitions, and legal and regulatory events), convertible bond trading and various types of volatility trading.  

 Exchange-Based Market-Making Activities. Our exchange-based market-making business consists of our stock and exchange-traded funds (ETF) market-making activities. In the United States, we are one of the leading Designated Market Makers for stocks traded on the NYSE. For ETFs, we are registered market makers on NYSE Arca.  

 Insurance Activities. We engage in a range of insurance and reinsurance businesses, including buying, originating and/or reinsuring fixed and variable annuity and life insurance contracts, reinsuring property catastrophe and residential homeowner risks and providing power interruption coverage to power generating facilities.  

 Principal Investments  

 Principal Investments primarily includes net revenues from three sources: returns on corporate and real estate investments; overrides on corporate and real estate investments made by merchant banking funds that we manage; and our investment in the ordinary shares of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC).   

 9  
 Returns on Corporate and Real Estate Investments. As of December 2009, the aggregate carrying value of our principal investments held directly or through our merchant banking funds, excluding our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC and our investment in the convertible preferred stock of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, Inc. (SMFG), was $13.98 billion, comprised of corporate principal investments with an aggregate carrying value of $12.60 billion and real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value of $1.38 billion. In addition, as of December 2009, we had outstanding unfunded equity capital commitments of up to $12.27 billion, comprised of corporate principal investment commitments of $9.82 billion and real estate investment commitments of $2.45 billion.  

 Overrides. Consists of the increased share of the income and gains derived from our merchant banking funds when the return on a funds investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns (typically referred to as an override). Overrides are recognized in net revenues when all material contingencies have been resolved.  

 ICBC. Our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC is valued using the quoted market price adjusted for transfer restrictions. Under the original transfer restrictions, the ICBC shares we held would have become free from transfer restrictions in equal installments on April 28, 2009 and October 20, 2009. During the quarter ended March 2009, the shares became subject to new supplemental transfer restrictions. Under these new supplemental transfer restrictions, on April 28, 2009, 20% of the ICBC shares that we held became free from transfer restrictions and we completed the disposition of these shares during the second quarter of 2009. Our remaining ICBC shares are subject to transfer restrictions, which prohibit liquidation at any time prior to April 28, 2010. As of December 2009, the fair value of our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC was $8.11 billion, of which $5.13 billion is held by investment funds managed by Goldman Sachs. For further information regarding our investment in the ordinary shares of ICBC, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies  Fair Value  Cash Instruments in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

 Asset Management and Securities Services  

 Asset Management and Securities Services represented 13% of 2009 net revenues. Our asset management business provides investment and wealth advisory services and offers investment products (primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled vehicles) across all major asset classes to a diverse group of institutions and individuals worldwide. Asset Management primarily generates revenues in the form of management and incentive fees. Securities Services provides prime brokerage services, financing services and securities lending services to institutional clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and foundations, and to high-net-worth individuals worldwide, and generates revenues primarily in the form of interest rate spreads or fees.  

 Our Asset Management and Securities Services segment is divided into two components: Asset Management and Securities Services.  

 Asset Management  

 Asset Management primarily consists of two related businesses  Goldman Sachs Asset Management (GSAM) and Private Wealth Management (PWM)  through which we offer a broad array of investment strategies and wealth advisory services to a diverse group of clients worldwide. In addition, Asset Management includes management fees related to our merchant banking activities.  

 GSAM. GSAM provides asset management services and offers investment products (primarily through separately managed accounts and commingled vehicles, such as mutual funds and private investment funds) across all major asset classes: money markets, fixed income, equities and alternative investments (including hedge funds, private equity, real estate, currencies, commodities and asset allocation strategies). GSAM distributes investment products directly to the firms institutional clients, including pension funds, governmental organizations, corporations, insurance    

 10  
 companies, banks, foundations and endowments, and indirectly to institutional and individual clients through third-party distribution channels, including brokerage firms, banks, insurance companies and other financial intermediaries. In addition, our Global Portfolio Solutions team offers clients investment and advisory services extending to risk management, portfolio implementation, reporting and monitoring.  

 PWM. PWM provides investment and wealth advisory services globally to high-net-worth individuals, family offices and selected institutions (principally foundations and endowments).  

 Management of Merchant Banking Funds. Goldman Sachs sponsors numerous corporate and real estate private investment funds. As of December 2009, the amount of Assets under management (AUM) in these funds (including both funded amounts and unfunded commitments on which we earn fees) was $93 billion.  

 Our strategy with respect to these funds generally is to invest opportunistically to build a portfolio of investments that is diversified by industry, product type, geographic region, and transaction structure and type. Our corporate investment funds pursue, on a global basis, long-term investments in equity and debt securities in privately negotiated transactions, leveraged buyouts, acquisitions and investments in funds managed by external parties. Our real estate investment funds invest in real estate operating companies, debt and equity interests in real estate assets, and other real estate-related investments. In addition, our merchant banking funds include funds that invest in infrastructure and infrastructure-related assets and companies on a global basis.  

 Merchant banking activities generate three primary revenue streams. First, we receive a management fee that is generally a percentage of a funds committed capital, invested capital, total gross acquisition cost or asset value. These annual management fees are included in our Asset Management net revenues. Second, Goldman Sachs, as a substantial investor in some of these funds, is allocated its proportionate share of the funds unrealized appreciation or depreciation arising from changes in fair value as well as gains and losses upon realization. Third, after a fund has achieved a minimum return for fund investors, we receive an increased share of the funds income and gains that is a percentage of the income and gains from the funds investments. The second and third of these revenue streams are included in Principal Investments within our Trading and Principal Investments segment.  

 Assets under management. AUM typically generates fees as a percentage of asset value, which is affected by investment performance and by inflows and redemptions. The fees that we charge vary by asset class, as do our related expenses. In certain circumstances, we are also entitled to receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a funds return or when the return on assets under management exceeds specified benchmark returns or other performance targets. Incentive fees are recognized when the performance period ends (in most cases, on December 31) and they are no longer subject to adjustment.  

 AUM includes assets in our mutual funds, alternative investment funds and separately managed accounts for institutional and individual investors. Alternative investments include our merchant banking funds, which generate revenues as described above under  Management of Merchant Banking Funds. AUM includes assets in clients brokerage accounts to the extent that they generate fees based on the assets in the accounts rather than commissions on transactional activity in the accounts.  

 AUM does not include assets in brokerage accounts that generate commissions, mark-ups and spreads based on transactional activity, or our own investments in funds that we manage. Net revenues from these assets are included in our Trading and Principal Investments segment. AUM also does not include non-fee-paying assets, including interest-bearing deposits held through our bank depository institution subsidiaries.   

 11  
 The amount of AUM is set forth in the graph below. In the following graph, as well as in the following tables, substantially all assets under management are valued as of December 31 (in the case of 2009) and November 30 (in the case of earlier years):

 Securities Services  

 Securities Services provides prime brokerage services, financing services and securities lending services to institutional clients, including hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and foundations, and to high-net-worth individuals worldwide.  

 Prime brokerage services. We offer prime brokerage services to our clients, allowing them the flexibility to trade with most brokers while maintaining a single source for financing and consolidated portfolio reports. Our prime brokerage business provides clearing and custody in 53 markets globally and provides consolidated multi-currency accounting and reporting, fund administration and other ancillary services.  

 Financing services. A central element of our prime brokerage business involves providing financing to our clients for their securities trading activities through margin and securities loans that are collateralized by securities, cash or other acceptable collateral.  

 Securities lending services. Securities lending services principally involve the borrowing and lending of securities to cover clients and Goldman Sachs short sales and otherwise to make deliveries into the market. In addition, we are an active participant in the broker-to-broker securities lending business and the third-party agency lending business. As a general matter, net revenues in securities lending services in our second quarter are higher due to seasonally higher activity levels in Europe.   

 Global Investment Research   

 Global Investment Research provides fundamental research on companies, industries, economies, currencies and commodities and macro strategy research on a worldwide basis.  

 Global Investment Research employs a team approach that as of December 2009 provided research coverage of more than 3,000 companies worldwide and over 45 national economies. This is accomplished by the following departments:

       The Global ECS Department formulates macroeconomic forecasts for economic activity, foreign exchange and interest rates, provides research on the commodity markets, and provides equity market forecasts, opinions on both asset and industry sector allocation, equity trading strategies, credit trading strategies and options research.    

 Further information regarding research at Goldman Sachs is provided below under  Regulation  Regulations Applicable in and Outside the United States and Legal Proceedings  Research Independence Matters in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   

 Business Continuity and Information Security   

 Business continuity and information security are high priorities for Goldman Sachs. Our Business Continuity Program has been developed to provide reasonable assurance of business continuity in the event of disruptions at the firms critical facilities and to comply with the regulatory requirements of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Because we are a bank holding company, our Business Continuity Program is also subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board. The key elements of the program are crisis management, people recovery facilities, business recovery, systems and data recovery, and process improvement. In the area of information security, we have developed and implemented a framework of principles, policies and technology to protect the information assets of the firm and our clients. Safeguards are applied to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information resources.   

 Employees   

 Management believes that a major strength and principal reason for the success of Goldman Sachs is the quality and dedication of our people and the shared sense of being part of a team. We strive to maintain a work environment that fosters professionalism, excellence, diversity, cooperation among our employees worldwide and high standards of business ethics.  

 Instilling the Goldman Sachs culture in all employees is a continuous process, in which training plays an important part. All employees are offered the opportunity to participate in education and periodic seminars that we sponsor at various locations throughout the world. Another important part of instilling the Goldman Sachs culture is our employee review process. Employees are reviewed by supervisors, co-workers and employees they supervise in a 360-degree review process that is integral to our team approach.  

 As of December 2009, we had 32,500 total staff, excluding staff at consolidated entities held for investment purposes. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Results of Operations  Operating Expenses in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our consolidated entities held for investment purposes.   

 Competition   

 The financial services industry  and all of our businesses  are intensely competitive, and we expect them to remain so. Our competitors are other entities that provide investment banking, securities and investment management services, as well as those entities that make investments in securities, commodities, derivatives, real estate, loans and other financial assets. These entities include brokers and dealers, investment banking firms, commercial banks, insurance companies, investment advisers, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and merchant banks. We compete with some of our competitors globally and with others on a regional, product or niche basis. Our competition is based on a number of factors, including transaction execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation and price.   

 14  
 We also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees and to continue to compensate employees competitively amid intense public and regulatory scrutiny on the compensation practices of large financial institutions. Our pay practices and those of our principal competitors are subject to review by, and the standards of, the Federal Reserve Board and regulators outside the United States, including the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the United Kingdom. See Regulation  Banking Regulation  Compensation Practices below and Risk Factors  Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the regulation of our compensation practices.  

 Over time, there has been substantial consolidation and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. This trend accelerated in recent years as the credit crisis caused numerous mergers and asset acquisitions among industry participants. Many commercial banks and other broad-based financial services firms have had the ability for some time to offer a wide range of products, from loans, deposit-taking and insurance to brokerage, asset management and investment banking services, which may enhance their competitive position. They also have had the ability to support investment banking and securities products with commercial banking, insurance and other financial services revenues in an effort to gain market share, which has resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking and trading businesses and could result in pricing pressure in other of our businesses.  

 Moreover, we have faced, and expect to continue to face, pressure to retain market share by committing capital to businesses or transactions on terms that offer returns that may not be commensurate with their risks. In particular, corporate clients seek such commitments (such as agreements to participate in their commercial paper backstop or other loan facilities) from financial services firms in connection with investment banking and other assignments.  

 We provide these commitments primarily through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries (including the William Street entities) and through Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC. With respect to most of these commitments, SMFG provides us with credit loss protection that is generally limited to 95% of the first loss we realize on approved loan commitments, up to a maximum of approximately $950 million. In addition, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, upon our request, SMFG will provide protection for 70% of additional losses on such commitments, up to a maximum of $1.13 billion, of which $375 million of protection has been provided as of December 2009. We also use other financial instruments to mitigate credit risks related to certain of these commitments that are not covered by SMFG. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding the William Street entities and for a description of the credit loss protection provided by SMFG. An increasing number of our commitments in connection with investment banking and other assignments are made through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries (other than the William Street entities) or our other subsidiaries. In addition, an increasing number of these commitments do not benefit from the SMFG loss protection.  

 The trend toward consolidation and convergence has significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitors. This trend has also hastened the globalization of the securities and other financial services markets. As a result, we have had to commit capital to support our international operations and to execute large global transactions. To take advantage of some of our most significant challenges and opportunities, we will have to compete successfully with financial institutions that are larger and better capitalized and that may have a stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the United States.  

 We have experienced intense price competition in some of our businesses in recent years. For example, over the past several years the increasing volume of trades executed electronically, through the internet and through alternative trading systems, has increased the pressure on trading commissions, in that commissions for low-touch electronic trading are generally lower than for    

 15  
 high-touch non-electronic trading. It appears that this trend toward electronic and other low-touch, low-commission trading will continue. In addition, we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressures in these and other areas in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by further reducing prices.   

 Regulation   

 Goldman Sachs, as a participant in the banking, securities, commodity futures and options and insurance industries, is subject to extensive regulation in the United States and the other countries in which we operate. See Risk Factors  Our businesses and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of the effect that regulation may have on our businesses. As a matter of public policy, regulatory bodies around the world are charged with safeguarding the integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the interests of clients participating in those markets, including depositors in U.S. depository institutions such as GS Bank USA. They are not, however, generally charged with protecting the interests of Goldman Sachs shareholders or creditors.  

 Recent market disruptions have led to numerous proposals in the United States and internationally for potentially significant changes in the regulation of the financial services industry. See Risk Factors  Our business and those of our clients are subject to extensive and pervasive regulation around the world in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of some of these proposals and their potential impact on us.  

 Banking Regulation  

 On September 21, 2008, Group Inc. became a bank holding company under the BHC Act. As of that date, the Federal Reserve Board became the primary U.S. regulator of Group Inc., as a consolidated entity. As of August 14, 2009, Group Inc. elected to become a financial holding company under the U.S. Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act), as described below.  

 Supervision and Regulation  

 As a bank holding company and a financial holding company under the BHC Act, Group Inc. is subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Under the system of functional regulation established under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve Board supervises Group Inc., including all of its nonbank subsidiaries, as an umbrella regulator of the consolidated organization and generally defers to the primary U.S. regulators of Group Inc.s U.S. depository institution subsidiary, as applicable, and to the other U.S. regulators of Group Inc.s U.S. non-depository institution subsidiaries that regulate certain activities of those subsidiaries. Such functionally regulated non-depository institution subsidiaries include broker-dealers registered with the SEC, such as our principal U.S. broker-dealer, Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS&Co.), insurance companies regulated by state insurance authorities, investment advisors registered with the SEC with respect to their investment advisory activities and entities regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with respect to certain futures-related activities.  

 Activities  

 The BHC Act generally restricts bank holding companies from engaging in business activities other than the business of banking and certain closely related activities. As a financial holding company under the GLB Act, we may engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than are permissible for bank holding companies as long as we continue to meet the eligibility requirements for financial holding companies. These activities include underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments in nonfinancial companies. In addition, we are permitted under the GLB Act to continue to engage in    

 16  
 certain commodities activities in the United States that were impermissible for bank holding companies as of September 30, 1997, if the assets held pursuant to these activities do not equal 5% or more of our consolidated assets. Our ability to maintain financial holding company status is dependent on a number of factors, including our U.S. depository institution subsidiaries continuing to qualify as well capitalized and well-managed as described under  Prompt Corrective Action below.  

 Although we do not believe that any activities that are material to our current or currently proposed business are impermissible activities for us as a financial holding company, the BHC Act also grants a new bank holding company, such as Group Inc., two years from the date the entity becomes a bank holding company to comply with the restrictions on its activities imposed by the BHC Act with respect to any activities in which it was engaged when it became a bank holding company. In addition, under the BHC Act, we can apply to the Federal Reserve Board for up to three one-year extensions.  

 As a bank holding company, Group Inc. is required to obtain prior Federal Reserve Board approval before directly or indirectly acquiring more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any unaffiliated depository institution. In addition, as a bank holding company, we may generally engage in banking and other financial activities abroad, including investing in and owning non-U.S. banks, if those activities and investments do not exceed certain limits and, in some cases, if we have obtained the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.  

 Capital Requirements  

 We are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the U.S. federal banking agencies. Our bank depository institution subsidiaries, including GS Bank USA, are subject to similar capital requirements. Under the Federal Reserve Boards capital adequacy requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (PCA) that is applicable to GS Bank USA, Goldman Sachs and its bank depository institution subsidiaries must meet specific capital requirements that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory reporting practices. Goldman Sachs and its bank depository institution subsidiaries capital amounts, as well as GS Bank USAs PCA classification, are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.  

 We report capital ratios computed in accordance with the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to bank holding companies, which are based on the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel I). These ratios are used by the Federal Reserve Board and other U.S. federal banking agencies in the supervisory review process, including the assessment of the firms capital adequacy.  

 Our Tier 1 capital consists of common shareholders equity, qualifying preferred stock and our junior subordinated debt issued to trusts, less deductions for goodwill, disallowed intangible assets and other items. Our total capital consists of our Tier 1 capital and our qualifying subordinated debt, less certain deductions. Our total capital ratio is equal to total capital as a percentage of Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs), which are calculated in accordance with the Federal Reserve Boards risk-based capital requirements, and our Tier 1 capital ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital as a percentage of RWAs. The calculation of RWAs is based on the amount of the firms market risk and credit risk. Certain measures included in the calculation of the firms RWAs for market risk are under review by the Federal Reserve Board. Additional information on the calculation of our Tier 1 capital, total capital and RWAs is set forth in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Equity Capital  Consolidated Capital Requirements, and in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, which are in Part II, Items 7 and 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

 As of December 2009, our total capital ratio was 18.2%, and our Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.0%.   

 17  
 We are currently working to implement the requirements set out in the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel II) as applicable to us as a bank holding company. U.S. banking regulators have incorporated the Basel II framework into the existing risk-based capital requirements by requiring that internationally active banking organizations, such as Group Inc., transition to Basel II over several years. During a parallel period, we anticipate that Group Inc.s capital calculations computed under both the Basel I rules and the Basel II rules will be reported to the Federal Reserve Board for examination and compliance for at least four consecutive quarterly periods. Once the parallel period and subsequent three-year transition period are successfully completed, Group Inc. will utilize the Basel II framework as its means of capital adequacy assessment, measurement and reporting and will discontinue use of Basel I. The Basel II framework was implemented in several countries during the second half of 2007 and in 2008, while others began implementation in 2009. The Basel II rules therefore already apply to certain of our operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions.  

 The Federal Reserve Board also has established minimum leverage ratio requirements. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel I divided by adjusted average total assets (which includes adjustments for disallowed goodwill and certain intangible assets). The minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio is 3% for bank holding companies that have received the highest supervisory rating under Federal Reserve Board guidelines or that have implemented the Federal Reserve Boards risk-based capital measure for market risk. Other bank holding companies must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. Bank holding companies may be expected to maintain ratios well above the minimum levels, depending upon their particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. As of December 2009, our Tier 1 leverage ratio under Basel I was 7.6%.  

 Payment of Dividends  

 Federal and state law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by our bank depository institution subsidiaries. The amount of dividends that may be paid by a state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, such as GS Bank USA or our national bank trust company subsidiary, is limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current years net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the bank obtains the approval of its chartering authority. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a banks undivided profits. New York law imposes similar limitations on New York State-chartered banks. As of December 2009, GS Bank USA could have declared dividends of $3.30 billion to Group Inc. in accordance with these limitations. In addition to the dividend restrictions described above, the banking regulators have authority to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise if, in the banking regulators opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.  

 It is also the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a bank holding company generally only pay dividends on common stock out of net income available to common shareholders over the past year and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding companys capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. In the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged dividend pay-out ratios that are at the 100% level unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. A bank holding company also should not maintain a dividend level that places undue pressure on the capital of bank depository institution subsidiaries, or that may undermine the bank holding companys ability to serve as a source of strength for such bank depository institution subsidiaries. Under temporary guidelines in effect for the near- to medium-term, certain large bank holding companies (including Group Inc.) are required to    

 18  
 consult with the Federal Reserve Board before increasing dividends. In addition, certain of Group Inc.s nonbank subsidiaries are subject to separate regulatory limitations on dividends and distributions, including our broker-dealer and our insurance subsidiaries as described below.  

 Source of Strength  

 Under Federal Reserve Board policy, Group Inc. is expected to act as a source of strength to GS Bank USA and to commit capital and financial resources to support this subsidiary. Such support may be required by the Federal Reserve Board at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it. Capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.  

 However, because the BHC Act provides for functional regulation of bank holding company activities by various regulators, the BHC Act prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from requiring payment by a holding company or subsidiary to a depository institution if the functional regulator of the payor objects to such payment. In such a case, the Federal Reserve Board could instead require the divestiture of the depository institution and impose operating restrictions pending the divestiture.  

 Cross-guarantee Provisions  

 Each insured depository institution controlled (as defined in the BHC Act) by the same bank holding company can be held liable to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of any other insured depository institution controlled by that holding company and for any assistance provided by the FDIC to any of those banks that is in danger of default. Such a cross-guarantee claim against a depository institution is generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding company and its affiliates against that depository institution. At this time, we control only one insured depository institution for this purpose, namely GS Bank USA. However, if, in the future, we were to control other insured depository institutions, such cross-guarantee would apply to all such insured depository institutions.  

 Compensation Practices  

 Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve Board. In October 2009, the Federal Reserve Board issued a comprehensive proposal on incentive compensation policies that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, including bank holding companies such as Group Inc. The proposal sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage excessive risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks, be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and be supported by strong corporate governance. The proposal also contemplates a detailed review by the Federal Reserve Board of the incentive compensation policies and practices of a number of large, complex banking organizations, including us. Any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The proposal provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. The scope and content of the Federal Reserve Boards policies on executive compensation are continuing to develop, and we expect that these policies will evolve over a number of years.   

 19  
 In September 2009, the Financial Stability Board, established at the direction of the leaders of the Group of 20, released standards for implementing certain compensation principles for banks and other financial companies designed to encourage sound compensation practices. These standards are to be implemented by local regulators. Thus far, regulators in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany, have proposed or adopted policies related to compensation at financial institutions. These policies are in addition to the proposals made by the Federal Reserve Board in October 2009. The United Kingdom has proposed a non-deductible 50% tax on certain financial institutions in respect of discretionary bonuses in excess of £25,000 awarded under arrangements made between December 9, 2009 and April 5, 2010 to relevant banking employees. Separately, the FDIC has solicited comments on whether to amend its risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to potentially increase assessment rates on financial institutions with compensation programs that put the Deposit Insurance Fund at risk.  

 FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program  

 Group Inc. and GS Bank USA participated in the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP), which applied to, among others, all U.S. depository institutions insured by the FDIC and all U.S. bank holding companies, unless they opted out of the TLGP or the FDIC terminated their participation. Under the TLGP, the FDIC guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of Group Inc., and, until December 31, 2009, guaranteed noninterest-bearing transaction account deposits at GS Bank USA, and in return for these guarantees the FDIC was paid a fee based on the amount of the deposit or the amount and maturity of the debt. Under the debt guarantee component of the TLGP, the FDIC will pay the unpaid principal and interest on an FDIC-guaranteed debt instrument upon the uncured failure of the participating entity to make a timely payment of principal or interest in accordance with the terms of the instrument. We have not issued long-term debt under the TLGP since March 2009, and all of our previously issued debt under the TLGP will mature on or prior to June 15, 2012. The debt guarantee component expired with respect to new issuances by us on October 31, 2009. Effective January 1, 2010, GS Bank USA is not participating in the transaction account guarantee component of the TLGP. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Funding Risk  Asset-Liability Management in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our participation in the TLGP.  

 GS Bank USA  

 Our U.S. depository institution subsidiary, GS Bank USA, a New York State-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC, is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York State Banking Department and is subject to minimum capital requirements that (subject to certain exceptions) are similar to those applicable to bank holding companies. A number of our businesses are conducted partially or entirely through GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries, including: bank loan trading and origination; interest rate, credit, currency and other derivatives; leveraged finance; commercial and residential mortgage origination, trading and servicing; structured finance; and agency lending, custody and hedge fund administration services. These businesses are subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve Board, the New York State Banking Department and the FDIC.  

 Deposit Insurance  

 GS Bank USA accepts deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC insurance up to the applicable limits. The FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions, which depend on the risk category of an institution and the amount of insured deposits that it holds. The FDIC required us to prepay our estimated assessments for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012 on December 30, 2009. The FDIC may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi-annual basis. We also participated in the TLGP as discussed above under  FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.   

 20  
 Prompt Corrective Action  

 The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), among other things, requires the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A depository institution is generally deemed to be well capitalized, the highest category, if it has a total capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% or greater and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater. In connection with the November 2008 asset transfer described under  Transactions with Affiliates below, GS Bank USA agreed with the Federal Reserve Board to minimum capital ratios in excess of these well capitalized levels. Accordingly, for a period of time, GS Bank USA is expected to maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, a total capital ratio of at least 11% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 6%. As of December 2009, GS Bank USAs Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.9%, its total capital ratio was 19.3% and its Tier 1 leverage ratio was 15.4%. GS Bank USA computes its capital ratios in accordance with the regulatory capital requirements currently applicable to state member banks, which are based on Basel I as implemented by the Federal Reserve Board. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, as the capital category of an institution declines. Failure to meet the capital requirements could also subject a depository institution to capital raising requirements. Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.  

 The prompt corrective action regulations apply only to depository institutions and not to bank holding companies such as Group Inc. However, the Federal Reserve Board is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level, based upon the undercapitalized status of the holding companys depository institution subsidiaries. In certain instances relating to an undercapitalized depository institution subsidiary, the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiarys capital restoration plan and might be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill its commitments on that guarantee. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, the guarantee would take priority over the parents general unsecured creditors.  

 Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution  

 If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution such as GS Bank USA, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the power:  

       to transfer any of the depository institutions assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institutions creditors;   

       to enforce the terms of the depository institutions contracts pursuant to their terms; or   

       to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution.     

 21  
 In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution, including claims of debt holders of the institution, in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of GS Bank USA, the debt holders would be treated differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the depositors of the depository institution.  

 Transactions with Affiliates  

 Transactions between GS Bank USA and Group Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates are regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. These regulations limit the types and amounts of transactions (including loans to and credit extensions from GS Bank USA) that may take place and generally require those transactions to be on an arms-length basis. These regulations generally do not apply to transactions between GS Bank USA and its subsidiaries. In November 2008, Group Inc. transferred assets and operations to GS Bank USA. In connection with this transfer, Group Inc. entered into a guarantee agreement with GS Bank USA whereby Group Inc. agreed to (i) purchase from GS Bank USA certain transferred assets (other than derivatives and mortgage servicing rights) or reimburse GS Bank USA for certain losses relating to those assets; (ii) reimburse GS Bank USA for credit-related losses from assets transferred to GS Bank USA; and (iii) protect GS Bank USA or reimburse it for certain losses arising from derivatives and mortgage servicing rights transferred to GS Bank USA. In accordance with the guarantee agreement, as of December 2009, Group Inc. is also required to pledge approximately $4 billion of collateral to GS Bank USA.  

 Trust Companies  

 Group Inc.s two limited purpose trust company subsidiaries operate under state or federal law. They are not permitted to and do not accept deposits or make loans (other than as incidental to their trust activities) and, as a result, are not insured by the FDIC. The Goldman Sachs Trust Company, N.A., a national banking association that is limited to fiduciary activities, is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System. The Goldman Sachs Trust Company of Delaware, a Delaware limited purpose trust company, is regulated by the Office of the Delaware State Bank Commissioner.  

 U.S. Securities and Commodities Regulation  

 Goldman Sachs broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of clients funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping, the financing of clients purchases, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.  

 In the United States, the SEC is the federal agency responsible for the administration of the federal securities laws. GS&Co. is registered as a broker-dealer and as an investment adviser with the SEC and as a broker-dealer in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA and the NYSE, adopt rules that apply to, and examine, broker-dealers such as GS&Co. In addition, state securities and other regulators also have regulatory or oversight authority over GS&Co. Similarly, our businesses are also subject to regulation by various non-U.S. governmental and regulatory bodies and self-regulatory authorities in virtually all countries where we have offices. Goldman Sachs Execution & Clearing, L.P. (GSEC) and one of its subsidiaries are registered U.S. broker-dealers and are regulated by the SEC, the NYSE and FINRA. Goldman Sachs Financial Markets, L.P. is registered with the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer and conducts certain OTC derivatives businesses.   

 22  
 The commodity futures and commodity options industry in the United States is subject to regulation under the U.S. Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). The CFTC is the federal agency charged with the administration of the CEA. Several of Goldman Sachs subsidiaries, including GS&Co. and GSEC, are registered with the CFTC and act as futures commission merchants, commodity pool operators or commodity trading advisors and are subject to the CEA. The rules and regulations of various self-regulatory organizations, such as the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, other futures exchanges and the National Futures Association, also govern the commodity futures and commodity options businesses of these entities.  

 GS&Co. and GSEC are subject to Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC and Rule 1.17 of the CFTC, which specify uniform minimum net capital requirements and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants assets be kept in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. and GSEC have elected to compute their minimum capital requirements in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by Rule 15c3-1. As of December 2009, GS&Co. had regulatory net capital, as defined by Rule 15c3-1, of $13.65 billion, which exceeded the amount required by $11.81 billion.

 Our exchange-based market-making businesses are subject to extensive regulation by a number of securities exchanges.

 Other Regulation in the United States  

 Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to state insurance regulation and oversight in the states in which they are domiciled and in the other states in which they are licensed, and Group Inc. is subject to oversight as an insurance holding company in states where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. State insurance regulations limit the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to Group Inc. in certain circumstances, and could require regulatory approval for any change in control of Group Inc., which may include control of 10% or more of our voting stock. In addition, a number of our other businesses, including our lending and mortgage businesses, require us to obtain licenses, adhere to applicable regulations and be subject to the oversight of various regulators in the states in which we conduct these businesses.  

 The U.S. Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (PATRIOT Act), contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandated the implementation of various regulations applicable to all financial institutions, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Through these and other provisions, the BSA and the PATRIOT Act seek to promote the identification of parties that may be involved in terrorism, money laundering or other suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside the United States contain some similar provisions. The obligation of financial institutions, including Goldman Sachs, to identify their clients, to monitor for and report suspicious transactions, to respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies, and to share information with other financial institutions, has required the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls that have increased, and may continue to increase, our costs, and any failure with respect to our programs in this area could subject us to substantial liability and regulatory fines.

 The SEC and FINRA have rules governing research analysts, including rules imposing restrictions on the interaction between equity research analysts and investment banking personnel at member securities firms. Various non-U.S. jurisdictions have imposed both substantive and disclosure-based requirements with respect to research and may impose additional regulations. In 2003, GS&Co. agreed to a global settlement with certain federal and state securities regulators and self-regulatory organizations to resolve investigations into equity research analysts alleged conflicts of interest. The global settlement includes certain restrictions and undertakings that impose costs and limitations on the conduct of our businesses, including restrictions on the interaction between research and investment banking areas.  

 Our investment management businesses are subject to significant regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world relating to, among other things, the safeguarding of client assets and our management of client funds.
