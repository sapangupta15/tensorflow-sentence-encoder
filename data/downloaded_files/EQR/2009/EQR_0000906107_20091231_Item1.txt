PART I  

 Item 1. Business  

General  

Equity Residential (EQR), a Maryland real estate investment trust (REIT) formed in March 1993, is an S&P 500 company focused on the acquisition, development and management of high quality apartment properties in top United States growth markets. EQR has elected to be taxed as a REIT.  

The Company is one of the largest publicly traded real estate companies and is the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily properties in the United States (based on the aggregate market value of its outstanding Common Shares, the number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned). The Companys corporate headquarters are located in Chicago, Illinois and the Company also operates property management offices throughout the United States.  

EQR is the general partner of, and as of December 31, 2009 owned an approximate 95.2% ownership interest in, ERP Operating Limited Partnership, an Illinois limited partnership (the Operating Partnership). The Company is structured as an umbrella partnership REIT (UPREIT) under which all property ownership and related business operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. References to the Company include EQR, the Operating Partnership and those entities owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership and/or EQR.  

As of December 31, 2009, the Company, directly or indirectly through investments in title holding entities, owned all or a portion of 495 properties in 23 states and the District of Columbia consisting of 137,007 units. The ownership breakdown includes (table does not include various uncompleted development properties):

Business Objectives and Operating Strategies  

The Company seeks to maximize current income, capital appreciation of each property and the total return for its shareholders. The Companys strategy for accomplishing these objectives includes:  

       Leveraging our size and scale in four critical ways:  

       Investing in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets to maximize our total return on an enterprise level;  

       Meeting the needs of our residents by offering a wide array of product choices and a commitment to service;  

       Engaging, retaining and attracting the best employees by providing them with the education, resources and opportunities to succeed; and  

       Sharing resources and best practices in both property management and across the enterprise.

       Owning a highly diversified portfolio in our target markets. Target markets are defined by a combination of the following criteria:  

       High barrier-to-entry markets where because of land scarcity or government regulation it is difficult or costly to build new apartment complexes leading to low supply;  

       Strong economic growth leading to high demand for apartments; and  

       Markets with an attractive quality of life leading to high demand and retention.  

       Giving residents reasons to stay with the Company by providing a range of product choices available in our diversified portfolio and by enhancing their experience with us through meticulous customer service by our employees and by providing various value-added services.  

       Being open and responsive to changes in the market in order to take advantage of investment opportunities that align with our long-term vision.  

Acquisition, Development and Disposition Strategies  

The Company anticipates that future property acquisitions, developments and dispositions will occur within the United States. Acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital, which may include retained cash flow, issuance of additional equity and debt securities, sales of properties, joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings. In addition, the Company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (OP Units) as consideration for the acquired properties. Such transactions may, in certain circumstances, enable the sellers to defer, in whole or in part, the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales. EQR may also acquire land parcels to hold and/or sell based on market opportunities.  

When evaluating potential acquisitions, developments and dispositions, the Company generally considers the following factors:  

       strategically targeted markets;  

       income levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market;  

       employment and household growth and net migration in the relevant markets population;  

       barriers to entry that would limit competition (zoning laws, building permit availability, supply of undeveloped or developable real estate, local building costs and construction costs, among other factors);  

       the location, construction quality, age, condition and design of the property;  

       the current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow;  

       the potential for capital appreciation of the property;  

       the terms of resident leases, including the potential for rent increases;  

       the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located;  

       the occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity (the overall market and submarket);  

       the prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property;  

       the benefits of integration into existing operations;  

       purchase prices and yields of available existing stabilized properties, if any;  

       competition from existing multifamily properties, comparably priced single family homes or rentals, residential properties under development and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area; and  

       opportunistic selling based on demand and price of high quality assets, including condominium conversions.  

The Company generally reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve its acquisition, development and rehab strategies and at times to fund its debt and equity repurchase activities. In addition, when feasible, the Company may structure these transactions as tax-deferred exchanges.

Credit Facilities  

The Operating Partnership has a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on February 28, 2012, with the ability to increase available borrowings by an additional $500.0 million by adding additional banks to the facility or obtaining the agreement of existing banks to increase their commitments. Advances under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based upon LIBOR at various interest periods plus a spread (currently 0.5%) dependent upon the Operating Partnerships credit rating or based on bids received from the lending group. EQR has guaranteed the Operating Partnerships credit facility up to the maximum amount and for the full term of the facility.

As a result, the Operating Partnerships borrowing capacity under the unsecured revolving credit facility has, in essence, been permanently reduced to $1.425 billion of potential borrowings. The obligation to fund by all of the other providers has not changed.

Competition  

All of the Companys properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties. The number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the Companys ability to lease units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged. The Company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the Company and whose managers have more experience than the Companys managers. In addition, other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information with respect to competition.
