Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 

 Management's discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the "Company" or "CBS Corp.") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Descriptions of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents so incorporated or included. Please see Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in Part I of this report for the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements.  

 Overview  

 In 2010, CBS Corporation's results were driven by the economic recovery and the strength of the Company's content, which led to increases in revenues of 8% to $14.06 billion, operating income of 80% to $1.82 billion and diluted earnings per share of 215% to $1.04. The Company generated net cash flow from operating activities of $1.74 billion which was used, along with cash on hand, to reduce its outstanding debt by $1.40 billion, including a $400.0 million reduction to the accounts receivable securitization program, as well as to fund $284.3 million of capital expenditures and pay $141.7 million of dividends to the Company's shareholders.  

 Revenue growth in 2010 was led by increases of 18% at Local Broadcasting, 6% at Entertainment, 9% at Cable Networks and 6% at Outdoor. Total advertising sales for 2010 increased 12% reflecting growth in both local and national advertising sales, primarily driven by the economic recovery and an increase in market share. Advertising revenues also benefited from the telecast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network and higher political advertising sales from the 2010 mid-term elections. Affiliate and subscription fees increased 9% driven by rate increases and growth in subscriptions at the Company's cable networks as well as higher retransmission revenues. Content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 2%, as increases in international syndication sales of television series and the addition of theatrical revenues in 2010, were more than offset by a decline in domestic syndication sales due to the first-cycle syndication sales of five major titles in 2009.  

 For 2010, operating income of $1.82 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.04 both grew at a higher rate than revenues as the revenue growth was primarily driven by high margin advertising and affiliate revenues. Operating income and diluted earnings per share comparisons were also impacted by 2009 pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of $210.0 million ($131.2 million, net of tax) or $.19 per diluted share.  

 For 2010, free cash flow of $1.45 billion increased 75% from $827.8 million for 2009 principally reflecting higher operating income partially offset by higher payments for taxes and a discretionary contribution of $167.0 million to pre-fund the Company's qualified pension plans in 2010. The Company generated net cash flow from operating activities of $1.74 billion for 2010 versus $939.4 million for 2009, which included a $150.0 million reduction to amounts outstanding under the Company's accounts receivable securitization program. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, reflects the Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program and less capital expenditures. See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information" on pages II-12 and II-13 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), to free cash flow.

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

CBS Corp. operates in the following segments:  

ENTERTAINMENT: The Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios,  CBS Studios International, CBS Television Distribution, CBS Films and CBS Interactive. Entertainment revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, content licensing and distribution, and affiliate and subscription fees. Entertainment contributed 53%, 54% and 49% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

CABLE NETWORKS: The Cable Networks segment consists of Showtime Networks, CBS College Sports Network and  Smithsonian Networks. CBS College Sports Network will be renamed CBS Sports Network in April 2011. Cable Networks revenues are generated primarily from affiliate fees, and content licensing and distribution. Cable Networks contributed 10% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and 9% for the year ended December 31, 2008.  

PUBLISHING: The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster's consumer book publishing business with imprints such as  Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner and  Free Press. Publishing contributed 6% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.  

LOCAL BROADCASTING: The Local Broadcasting segment consists of CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio, with revenues generated primarily from advertising sales.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Advertising sales increased 12% to $9.15 billion in 2010 from $8.17 billion in 2009 reflecting a broad recovery in both national and local advertising markets with growth across many key categories including automotive, financial services and retail, as well as higher political advertising from the 2010 mid-term elections. Network advertising revenues increased 12% with growth in primetime and sports, including the 2010 telecast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network. Local advertising sales increased 12% with growth from CBS Television Stations, CBS Radio and CBS Outdoor. CBS Interactive display advertising revenues increased 19%. In 2009, advertising sales decreased 12% to $8.17 billion in 2009 from $9.24 billion in 2008 primarily reflecting softness in the local advertising marketplace resulting from the weak economic environment with declines in spending across many categories, including automotive, healthcare and retail, as well as lower political advertising sales. The decline in advertising revenues in 2009 also reflected the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of CNET Networks, Inc. ("CNET") in June 2008. For 2009, Network advertising sales decreased 2% and local advertising sales decreased 20%.  

 Content licensing and distribution revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of internally produced programming to television, theaters and digital mediums, as well as for home entertainment sales; fees from the distribution of third party programming; and revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books. Content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 2% to $3.07 billion in 2010 from $3.12 billion in 2009 principally reflecting lower domestic syndication sales driven by the timing of availabilities, as 2010 included the second-cycle syndication sale of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation as compared to 2009 which included revenues from the first-cycle availabilities of five major titles, Medium, Criminal Minds, Ghost Whisperer,  Everybody Hates Chris and Numb3rs. This decrease was partially offset by higher international syndication sales of television programming and the addition of theatrical revenues in 2010. In 2009, content licensing and distribution revenues decreased 1% to $3.12 billion from $3.16 billion in 2008 principally reflecting 7% lower publishing revenues due to the soft retail market and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes, as well as 16% lower home entertainment revenues. Syndication revenues increased in 2009 reflecting the five previously mentioned major domestic syndication availabilities, partially offset by the 2008 domestic syndication sale of CSI: NY and the timing of international syndication sales.  

 Affiliate and subscription fees are principally comprised of revenues received from cable television operators, direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") operators, telephone companies ("Telcos") and other distributors for the carriage of the Company's cable networks, as well as for retransmission consent for the CBS Television Network and the Company's owned and operated television stations; fees received from non-CBS owned television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; and subscriber fees for online content. For 2010, affiliate and subscription fees increased 9% to $1.60 billion from $1.46 billion in 2009 and for 2009, affiliate and subscription fees increased 13% from $1.29 billion in 2008 principally reflecting growth in subscriptions and rate increases at Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports Network, and higher retransmission revenues. For 2009, the increase was also due to the impact of the acquisition of CNET in June 2008.

 Other revenues, which include ancillary fees for Entertainment, Cable Networks, Local Broadcasting and Outdoor operations, decreased 9% to $237.8 million in 2010 from $260.5 million in 2009 principally reflecting lower ancillary digital revenues. For 2009, other revenues decreased 1% to $260.5 million in 2009 from $263.5 million in 2008 primarily reflecting the absence of 2008 revenues associated with the Company's former agreements with Westwood One, Inc., which were concluded during the first quarter of 2008, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of CNET in June 2008.  

 International Revenues  

 The Company generated approximately 15% of its total revenues from international regions in 2010, 14% in 2009 and 16% in 2008.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Operating Expenses  

 The table below presents the Company's consolidated operating expenses by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Programming expenses represented 39% of total operating expenses in 2010 and 38% in 2009 and 2008, and reflect the amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast and cable networks, and television and radio stations. Programming expenses increased 5% to $3.51 billion in 2010 from $3.34 billion in 2009 reflecting higher sports programming costs, principally associated with the 2010 telecast of Super Bowl XLIV and the 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship on the CBS Television Network, partially offset by lower acquired television series costs. For 2009, programming expenses increased 1% to $3.34 billion from $3.29 billion in 2008 reflecting higher television series costs, principally from the impact of the Writers Guild of America ("WGA") strike which reduced programming costs for the 2007/2008 broadcast season, partially offset by lower costs from more internally produced series airing on the CBS Television Network for the 2009/2010 broadcast season.  

 Production expenses represented 23% of total operating expenses in 2010 and 24% in 2009 and 2008, and reflect the direct costs of internally developed television and theatrical film content, as well as television and radio costs, including on-air talent and other production costs. Production expenses of

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

$2.06 billion for 2010 remained relatively flat compared to 2009 reflecting lower costs associated with lower domestic syndication sales, offset by increased investment in new television series and theatrical films. For 2009, production expenses increased 1% to $2.06 billion from $2.03 billion in 2008 reflecting additional investment in new television series partially offset by lower radio talent costs and lower costs associated with the mix of syndication sales.  

 Billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses represented 11% of total operating expenses in 2010, 12% in 2009 and 13% in 2008, and reflect lease and franchise costs associated with billboards, transit and other outdoor displays, rent expense on production facilities, and other occupancy costs. Billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses increased 1% to $1.03 billion in 2010 from $1.02 billion in 2009 primarily driven by higher franchise expenses reflecting costs for new Outdoor transit contracts, partially offset by reductions attributable to lost contracts and cost-savings initiatives. This increase was partially offset by lower billboard lease costs, as well as lower maintenance and display site costs principally due to cost-savings initiatives. For 2009, billboard, transit and other occupancy expenses decreased 6% to $1.02 billion from $1.08 billion in 2008 primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes and lower billboard lease costs in Europe.  

 Participation, distribution and royalty costs, which represented 8% of total operating expenses in 2010, 7% in 2009 and 6% in 2008, primarily include participation and residual expenses for television programming, royalty costs for Publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to television and feature film content, including print and advertising. Participation, distribution and royalty costs increased 16% to $693.1 million in 2010 from $597.0 million in 2009 primarily reflecting higher advertising expense for theatrical films. For 2009, participation, distribution and royalty costs increased 18% from $505.0 million in 2008 principally reflecting higher participations associated with higher syndication sales, higher publishing royalty expenses and higher advertising for theatrical films.  

 Other operating expenses, which represented 19% of total operating expenses in 2010 and 2009, and 20% in 2008, primarily include compensation costs, costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing, and costs associated with the production and hosting of internet sites. For 2010, other operating expenses remained relatively flat at $1.69 billion. For 2009, other operating expenses decreased 3% to $1.69 billion from $1.74 billion in 2008 primarily reflecting lower Publishing operations costs, including lower production costs driven by the decrease in revenues and lower freight and delivery costs, as well as lower employee-related costs due to restructuring and cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by increased costs associated with digital media, including the impact of the acquisition of CNET in June 2008.  

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

 Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, which include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support, represented 19% of revenues for each of the years 2010, 2009 and 2008. SG&A expenses increased $126.9 million, or 5%, to $2.62 billion in 2010 from $2.49 billion in 2009 principally reflecting higher selling expenses and incentive compensation driven by the improved operating results, higher advertising expense, a settlement of $28.0 million in 2009 relating to a previously disposed business, and 2009 gains of $40.3 million from the sale and exchange of certain long-lived assets, partially offset by a settlement of $90.2 million in 2010 related to the favorable resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses and lower pension and postretirement benefit costs. In 2010, pension and postretirement benefits expenses decreased $50.6 million from 2009 primarily due to the favorable performance of pension plan assets in 2009.  

II-8 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 For 2009, SG&A expenses decreased $120.3 million, or 5%, to $2.49 billion from $2.61 billion in 2008, primarily due to lower employee-related costs resulting from restructuring and cost-savings initiatives implemented across the Company's segments, lower selling expenses driven by the revenue decline, lower advertising expenses, the favorable impact from the termination of a real estate lease arrangement and gains on the sale and exchange of certain long-lived assets. These decreases were partially offset by increased pension costs and the impact of the acquisition of CNET. In 2009, pension and postretirement benefits expenses increased $91.0 million from 2008 due to the unfavorable performance of pension plan assets in 2008.  

 Restructuring Charges  

 During the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $80.6 million, reflecting $65.9 million of severance costs associated with the elimination of positions and $15.6 million of contract termination and other associated costs, partially offset by the reversal of $.9 million as a result of changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $22.8 million, reflecting $20.8 million of severance costs and $6.7 million of contract termination and other associated costs, partially offset by the reversal of $4.7 million as a result of changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. During the year ended December 31, 2008, the Company recorded restructuring charges of $136.7 million, which reflected $127.5 million of severance costs and $9.2 million of contract termination and other associated costs. As of December 31, 2010, the cumulative amount paid since the restructuring activities began in 2008 was $182.7 million, of which $166.8 million was for severance costs and $15.9 million was related to contract termination and other associated costs. The Company expects to substantially utilize the remaining reserves by the end of 2011.

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Impairment Charges  

 The Company performs an annual fair value-based impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily comprised of FCC licenses, during the fourth quarter and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its book value. Based on the 2010 annual impairment test, the estimated fair value of each of the Company's reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets is greater than its carrying value and therefore no impairment charge was required.  

 During 2009, as a result of the Company's annual impairment test of FCC licenses, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $178.3 million at the Local Broadcasting segment to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses in certain radio markets. This impairment resulted from reductions in projections for advertising revenues due to a weakened radio advertising marketplace.  

 Also in 2009, in connection with the sale of certain of its radio stations, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $31.7 million to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses by $20.7 million and the allocated goodwill by $11.0 million.  

 During the third quarter of 2008, the Company performed an interim impairment test as a result of its assessment of factors, including the continuation of adverse market conditions, which affected the Company's market value and trading multiples for entities within the Company's industry, as well as the continued economic slowdown which adversely affected the Company's advertising revenues, primarily at the Company's local businesses. As a result of this interim impairment test, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $14.12 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill by $10.99 billion and intangible assets by $3.13 billion. The charge was reflected as a reduction to goodwill at the Entertainment segment of $3.80 billion, the Local Broadcasting segment of $4.34 billion and the Outdoor segment of $2.85 billion, as well as a reduction to the carrying value of intangible assets related to FCC licenses at the Local Broadcasting segment of $3.12 billion and franchise agreements at the Outdoor segment of $8.2 million.  

 Also in 2008, in connection with the sale of certain of its radio stations, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $62.0 million to reduce the carrying value of FCC licenses by $30.4 million and the allocated goodwill by $31.6 million.  

 Depreciation and Amortization  

 Depreciation and amortization decreased $20.0 million, or 3%, to $562.3 million for 2010 from $582.3 million for 2009 principally reflecting lower depreciation for outdoor advertising properties and lower depreciation and amortization associated with interactive businesses. For 2009, depreciation and amortization increased $50.7 million, or 10%, to $582.3 million from $531.6 million for 2008 principally reflecting higher depreciation and amortization associated with fixed assets and intangible assets acquired in June 2008 in connection with the CNET acquisition and higher depreciation resulting from capital expenditures at Outdoor.  

 Interest Expense  

 For 2010, interest expense decreased $13.2 million to $528.8 million from $542.0 million in 2009 primarily resulting from the reduction of debt during 2010. For 2009, interest expense decreased $4.6 million to $542.0 million from $546.6 million in 2008. The Company had $6.00 billion at December 31,  

II-10 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

2010 and $7.00 billion at December 31, 2009, of principal amounts of debt outstanding (including current maturities) at weighted average interest rates of 7.0% and 7.2%, respectively. The debt activity during 2010 is expected to result in annualized net interest expense savings of approximately $90 million.  

 Interest Income  

 Interest income decreased $.5 million to $5.5 million for 2010 from $6.0 million for 2009. For 2009, interest income decreased $36.2 million to $6.0 million from $42.2 million in 2008 reflecting lower interest rates and lower average cash balances.  

 Gain (Loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt  

 For 2010, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $81.4 million was associated with the repurchase and redemption of $2.07 billion of the Company's debt, of which $750.0 million was repurchased through a tender offer (See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).  

 For 2009, the loss on early extinguishment of debt of $29.8 million was associated with the repurchase of $978.3 million of the Company's debt, of which $825.5 million was repurchased through a tender offer.  

 For 2008, the gain on early extinguishment of debt of $8.4 million was associated with the repurchase of $191.8 million of the Company's 7.70% senior notes due 2010.  

 Other Items, Net  

 For 2010, "Other items, net" of $9.9 million primarily consisted of gains of $20.7 million associated with dispositions, partially offset by foreign exchange losses of $9.6 million.  

 For 2009, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $2.6 million primarily consisting of losses of $6.7 million associated with securitizing accounts receivables and a non-cash charge of $7.7 million associated with other-than-temporary declines in the market value of the Company's investments, partially offset by foreign exchange gains of $11.1 million.  

 For 2008, "Other items, net" of $79.6 million principally consisted of a gain of $129.8 million on the sale of the Company's investment in Sundance Channel, foreign exchange gains of $32.3 million and a gain of $3.7 million relating to radio station divestitures, partially offset by a non-cash charge of $71.1 million associated with other-than-temporary declines in the market value of the Company's investments and $15.4 million of losses associated with securitizing accounts receivables.  

 (Provision) Benefit for Income Taxes  

 The provision for income taxes represents federal, state, local and foreign income taxes on earnings (loss) before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. The Company reported income tax provisions of $462.7 million and $182.8 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, and an income tax benefit of $919.3 million in 2008, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 37.9% in 2010, 41.3% in 2009 and 7.3% in 2008.  

 The provision for income taxes for 2010 included a $62.2 million reduction of deferred tax assets associated with the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, partially offset by a $26.4 million reversal of previously established deferred tax liabilities. Also included in the Company's tax provision were tax benefits of $28.1 million in 2010, $47.0 million in 2009 and $39.6 million in 2008 from the settlements of income tax audits, benefits of $78.8 million in 2009 and $1.45 billion in 2008 associated with  

II-11 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

the non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, and reductions of deferred tax assets associated with stock-based compensation of $42.6 million in 2009 and $7.2 million in 2008. This reduction reflects the difference between the estimated tax benefit recognized based on the grant date fair value of the stock-based compensation award versus the actual tax benefit realized based on the market value on the date of vest.  

 For 2011, the Company's annual effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 39%.  

 Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax  

 Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax, was $34.6 million for 2010, $33.7 million for 2009 and $17.6 million for 2008 reflecting the Company's share of the operating results of its equity investments.  

 Net Earnings (Loss)  

 The Company reported net earnings of $724.2 million and $226.5 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, versus a net loss of $11.67 billion in 2008. Comparability of net earnings (loss) was impacted by several large discrete items, including pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of $210.0 million ($131.2 million, net of tax) in 2009 and $14.18 billion ($12.73 billion, net of tax) in 2008, settlements of $90.2 million in 2010 and $28.0 million in 2009 from the favorable resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses, restructuring charges of $80.6 million in 2010, $22.8 million in 2009, and $136.7 million in 2008, pre-tax losses on the early extinguishment of debt of $81.4 million in 2010 and $29.8 million in 2009, and a gain on the sale of the Company's investment in Sundance Channel of $129.8 million ($79.9 million, net of tax) in 2008.  

 Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information  

 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects the Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program and less capital expenditures. The Company's net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  

 The Company's calculation of free cash flow for 2009 does not include increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program because the Company does not consider the cash flow from this program to be indicative of the cash generated by the underlying operating performance of the Company. Accordingly, the Company considers its decision to increase or decrease its accounts receivable securitization program a financing decision. In 2010, as a result of the adoption of amended Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets, increases and decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program are reflected as financing activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Under the previous guidance these changes were reflected as operating activities. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. Also, the Company's calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures since investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to the Company's operations.  

 Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to the Company to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain its capital assets, satisfy its tax obligations and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of the Company's ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of the Company's operating performance. The Company believes the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for  

II-12 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from the Company's underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is one of several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is also a primary measure used externally by the Company's investors, analysts and peers in its industry for purposes of valuation and comparing the operating performance of the Company to other companies in its industry.  

 As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as the Company calculates it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, and does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of the Company's ability to fund its cash needs. When comparing free cash flow to net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are not reflected in free cash flow.  

 The following table presents a reconciliation of the Company's net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.

 Segment Results of OperationsÂ—For the Years Ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008  

 The following tables present the Company's revenues, segment operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization and impairment charges ("Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges"), operating income (loss), depreciation and amortization, and impairment charges by segment, for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. The Company presents Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges (or Segment OIBDA if there is no impairment charge), as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. The Company believes the presentation of Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management and enhances their ability to understand the Company's operating performance.

 2010 vs. 2009  

 For 2010, Entertainment revenues increased 6% to $7.39 billion from $6.98 billion in 2009 primarily reflecting higher advertising and retransmission revenues, partially offset by lower content licensing and distribution revenues. Advertising revenues increased 11% primarily reflecting 12% higher national advertising revenues, driven by higher pricing due to the economic recovery and the strength of Network primetime and sports programming, including the 2010 telecast of Super Bowl XLIV on the CBS Television Network, as well as 19% growth in CBS Interactive display advertising revenues. Revenues from content licensing and distribution decreased 3% as higher international syndication sales, the addition of theatrical revenues in 2010 and 2010 domestic syndication sales, including the second-cycle sale of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, were more than offset by the first-cycle domestic syndication sales of five major titles in 2009.  

 For 2010, Entertainment operating income increased 1% to $708.4 million from $699.9 million for 2009. Entertainment OIBDA for 2010 decreased $4.4 million to $871.5 million from $875.9 million in 2009 as the increase in revenues was more than offset by higher sports programming costs, principally attributable to Super Bowl XLIV and the 2010 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship, increased investment in television and film content, and restructuring charges of $22.8 million incurred in 2010. The restructuring charges principally reflect severance costs associated with the elimination of positions. Entertainment results included stock-based compensation expense of $42.9 million for 2010 and $44.2 million for 2009. The Company anticipates that the sports programming arrangement with the NCAA and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. will result in improved operating income and OIBDA margins for the Entertainment segment beginning in 2011.  

 Capital expenditures increased $18.2 million to $90.6 million in 2010 from $72.4 million in 2009 primarily due to increased spending for high-definition upgrades.  

 License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on cable are recorded as revenues in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may

cause substantial fluctuations in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were $654.1 million and $387.0 million at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  

 2009 vs. 2008  

 For 2009, Entertainment revenues increased 1% to $6.98 billion from $6.88 billion in 2008 primarily reflecting higher content licensing and distribution revenues and the impact of the acquisition of CNET in June 2008, partially offset by lower advertising sales. Revenues from content licensing and distribution increased 1% primarily due to higher domestic syndication sales in 2009, which included the first-cycle sales of Medium,  Criminal Minds, Ghost Whisperer, Everybody Hates Chris and Numb3rs, compared to 2008, which included the domestic syndication sale of CSI: NY, partially offset by the timing of international syndication sales and lower home entertainment sales. Advertising sales decreased slightly reflecting 2% lower national television advertising sales as a result of softness in the advertising marketplace during the first half of 2009, partially offset by the impact of the acquisition of CNET. CBS Interactive display advertising revenues increased 34%, as CBS Interactive results for the first half of 2008 did not include CNET, which was acquired in June 2008. CBS Interactive display advertising revenues were also impacted by the soft advertising marketplace.  

 For 2009, Entertainment reported operating income of $699.9 million compared to an operating loss of $2.91 billion in 2008, which included non-cash impairment charges of $3.80 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill. Entertainment OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 14% to $875.9 million in 2009 from $1.02 billion in 2008 primarily due to lower advertising sales, higher investment in programming, including the impact of the WGA strike which reduced programming costs for the 2007/2008 broadcast season, partially offset by higher profits from syndication sales and the absence of $22.9 million of restructuring charges incurred in 2008. Restructuring charges in 2008 reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of positions and 2009 reflected a reversal of $.6 million due to changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. Entertainment results included stock-based compensation expense of $44.2 million for 2009 and $47.4 million for 2008.  

 Capital expenditures decreased $53.4 million to $72.4 million in 2009 from $125.8 million in 2008 primarily due to 2008 spending for broadcast facilities and high-definition television upgrades.  

 Acquisition  

 During June 2008, the Company completed the acquisition of CNET for $1.8 billion.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2010 vs. 2009  

 For 2010, Cable Networks revenues increased 9% to $1.48 billion from $1.35 billion in 2009 primarily due to 8% higher affiliate fees, reflecting rate increases and growth in subscriptions at Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports Network, as well as higher home entertainment and download revenues of  Showtime original series. At December 31, 2010, Showtime Networks, including Showtime,  The Movie Channel and Flix, in the aggregate had 67.1 million subscriptions, up by 5.8 million from December 31, 2009, principally reflecting increases across all platforms, led by growth in DBS and Telco. CBS College Sports Network subscriptions of 39.1 million at December 31, 2010 were up by 4.3 million from December 31, 2009, resulting from increased carriage across all platforms as well as the launch of CBS College Sports Network by additional multi-system operators.

 For 2010, Cable Networks operating income increased 24% to $543.9 million from $437.4 million in 2009 and OIBDA increased 23% to $566.2 million from $461.0 million for 2009, primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher marketing and advertising costs for new Showtime original series as well as to support the overall growth of Showtime Networks and higher costs for sports programming. Restructuring charges of $3.1 million in 2010 principally reflect costs associated with exiting an operating facility. Cable Networks results included stock-based compensation expense of $5.1 million for 2010 and $6.3 million for 2009.  

 Capital expenditures increased $11.2 million to $18.9 million in 2010 from $7.7 million in 2009 primarily due to increased spending on high-definition upgrades and leasehold improvements.  

 2009 vs. 2008  

 For 2009, Cable Networks revenues increased 7% to $1.35 billion from $1.26 billion in 2008 primarily due to 7% higher affiliate fees reflecting growth in subscriptions and rate increases at Showtime Networks and CBS College Sports Network. At December 31, 2009, Showtime Networks, including  Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix, in the aggregate, had 61.3 million subscriptions, up by 2.6 million from December 31, 2008, reflecting increased DBS and Telco subscriptions partially offset by a decline in cable subscriptions. At December 31, 2009, CBS College Sports Network subscriptions of 34.8 million were up by

9.5 million from December 31, 2008, reflecting increased carriage across all platforms. Smithsonian Networks had 4.9 million subscriptions at December 31, 2009, up by 1.5 million.  

 For 2009, Cable Networks operating income increased 20% to $437.4 million from $364.3 million for 2008 and OIBDA increased 18% to $461.0 million from $389.5 million for the same prior-year period primarily reflecting higher affiliate fees, partially offset by higher affiliate marketing and advertising costs for new  Showtime original series. Cable Networks results included stock-based compensation expense of $6.3 million for 2009 and $8.6 million for 2008.  

 Publishing (Simon & Schuster)  

 (Contributed 6% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 2010 vs. 2009  

 For 2010, Publishing revenues decreased slightly to $790.8 million from $793.5 million in 2009 primarily reflecting lower book sales in the adult group, partially offset by growth in sales of digital content of 122%. Revenues from digital content represented 8% of total Publishing revenues in 2010 versus 3% in 2009. Best selling titles in 2010 included Glenn Beck's Broke and The Overton Window, and  Spoken from the Heart by Laura Bush.  

 For 2010, Publishing operating income increased 43% to $60.9 million from $42.5 million in 2009 and OIBDA increased 36% to $68.1 million from $50.2 million for 2009 reflecting lower production expenses from a change in the mix of titles and the impact of cost reduction measures, partially offset by higher bad debt expense and restructuring charges of $3.7 million incurred in 2010. The restructuring charges reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of positions. Publishing results included stock-based compensation expense of $3.0 million for 2010 and $3.5 million for 2009.  

 2009 vs. 2008  

 For 2009, Publishing revenues decreased 7% to $793.5 million from $857.7 million in 2008, principally reflecting a soft retail market and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes partially offset by growth of $16.1 million in digital sales of Publishing content. Best-selling titles in 2009 included Arguing with Idiots by Glenn Beck and Kevin Balfe and Under the Dome by Stephen King.  

 For 2009, Publishing operating income decreased 46% to $42.5 million from $78.7 million in 2008 and OIBDA decreased 43% to $50.2 million from $88.2 million in 2008 primarily driven by the revenue decline

and higher royalty expenses, partially offset by lower production and delivery costs resulting from the revenue decrease, and lower selling, advertising and employee-related costs due to restructuring and cost-savings initiatives. Restructuring charges of $3.8 million in 2009 reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of positions. Publishing results included stock-based compensation expense of $3.5 million for 2009 and $4.2 million for 2008.  

 Local Broadcasting (CBS Television Stations and CBS Radio)  

 (Contributed 20%, 18% and 21% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.)  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

NMÂ—Not meaningful   

 2010 vs. 2009  

 For 2010, Local Broadcasting revenues increased 18% to $2.78 billion from $2.36 billion for 2009 driven by growth in advertising sales. CBS Television Stations revenues increased 27% to $1.45 billion for 2010 from $1.14 billion for 2009 as a result of the improved local advertising marketplace with growth across many key categories, led by automotive, retail and financial services, as well as higher political advertising sales, and the benefit of the 2010 telecast of  Super Bowl XLIV to the Company's owned CBS affiliated stations. CBS Radio revenues for 2010 increased 9% to $1.34 billion from $1.22 billion for 2009 and revenues from the ten largest radio markets increased 12%, reflecting the improved advertising marketplace with growth in many key categories, led by automotive and retail, and higher political advertising sales.  

 For 2010, Local Broadcasting operating income increased $527.7 million to $740.1 million from $212.4 million for 2009. Included in 2009 operating income were non-cash impairment charges of $210.0 million. Local Broadcasting OIBDA before impairment charges increased 64% to $839.7 million for 2010 from $512.9 million for 2009 and OIBDA before impairment charges margins increased to 30% in 2010 from 22% in 2009. These increases were primarily driven by the revenue growth and lower programming and talent expenses due to expense reduction measures, partially offset by gains of $40.3 million recorded in 2009 from the sale and exchange of certain long-lived assets and higher restructuring charges in 2010. Restructuring charges of $25.2 million for 2010 reflect severance costs associated with the elimination of positions, and contract terminations and other associated costs. Local Broadcasting results included stock-based compensation expense of $19.9 million for 2010 and $20.7 million for 2009.

 2009 vs. 2008  

 For 2009, Local Broadcasting revenues decreased 20% to $2.36 billion from $2.95 billion for 2008 primarily reflecting lower advertising sales from the impact of the economic recession and lower political advertising sales. Revenues for CBS Television Stations decreased 20% to $1.14 billion for 2009 from $1.41 billion for 2008, driven by declines in automotive, entertainment and retail as well as lower political advertising sales due to the 2008 presidential election. CBS Radio revenues decreased 21% to $1.22 billion for 2009 from $1.54 billion for 2008 and revenues from the ten largest radio markets decreased 17%, reflecting softness in the advertising marketplace resulting from the weak economic environment, with declines in automotive, retail and financial services, lower political advertising sales and the impact of station divestitures.  

 For 2009, Local Broadcasting reported operating income of $212.4 million versus an operating loss of $6.81 billion for 2008. Included in 2009 operating income were non-cash impairment charges of $210.0 million and included in the 2008 operating loss were non-cash impairment charges of $7.53 billion. Local Broadcasting OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 37% to $512.9 million for 2009 from $820.0 million for 2008 and OIBDA before impairment charges margins decreased to 22% for 2009 from 28% for 2008. These decreases were primarily driven by the decrease in revenues partially offset by $89.7 million lower restructuring charges in 2009 and lower talent, employee-related, marketing and promotion costs resulting from restructuring and cost-savings initiatives. Local Broadcasting results for 2009 also benefited from gains of $40.3 million from the sale and exchange of certain long-lived assets. Restructuring charges of $2.3 million in 2009 reflected $4.7 million of contract termination costs related to exiting a broadcasting equipment lease upon completion of the digital conversion, partially offset by the reversal of $2.4 million as a result of changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. Local Broadcasting results included stock-based compensation expense of $20.7 million for 2009 and $27.0 million for 2008.  

 Capital expenditures decreased $39.2 million, or 36%, to $70.4 million for 2009 from $109.6 million for 2008 principally reflecting 2008 spending associated with the relocation of local broadcasting facilities and high-definition television upgrades.  

 Dispositions  

 In August 2010, the Company completed the sale of its television station in Norfolk, Virginia to Local TV Holdings, LLC, for $16.5 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $7.6 million included in "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2010.  

 On September 30, 2009, the Company completed the sale of four of its owned radio stations in Portland, Oregon to Alpha Broadcasting for $40.0 million. In connection with the sale, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $31.7 million to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets and the allocated goodwill.  

 On April 1, 2009, the Company completed a transaction with Clear Channel Communications, Inc. for the swap of five of its mid-size market stations in Baltimore, Portland, Sacramento and Seattle, for two radio stations in Houston, a top 10 radio market. On March 6, 2009, the Company completed the sale of three of its owned radio stations in Denver to Wilks Broadcasting for $19.5 million. During 2008, in connection with these two transactions, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $62.0 million to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets and the allocated goodwill.  

 On January 10, 2008, the Company completed the sale of seven of its owned television stations in Austin, Salt Lake City, Providence and West Palm Beach to Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. for $185.0 million.

 2010 vs. 2009  

 For 2010, Outdoor revenues increased 6% to $1.82 billion from $1.72 billion for 2009 reflecting the improved advertising marketplace. Americas revenues (comprising North America and South America) increased 10% (8% in constant dollars) to $1.23 billion primarily reflecting growth in the U.S. billboards and displays businesses driven by higher occupancy rates, the impact of new transit contracts, and increases in Canada. Europe revenues of $592.4 million for 2010 remained relatively flat compared to 2009 reflecting revenue growth in the United Kingdom, Holland and Italy, offset by lower revenues in France and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. In constant dollars, Europe revenues increased 3% from 2009. Revenues for Asia decreased $12.7 million to $1.8 million for 2010 reflecting the absence of revenues from Outdoor China following its deconsolidation in the first quarter of 2010. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company sold its controlling interest in Outdoor China, resulting in the deconsolidation of the operations and its subsequent treatment as an equity method investment. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes on total Outdoor revenues was approximately $4 million for 2010. Approximately 45% and 47% of Outdoor revenues were generated from regions outside the U.S. for 2010 and 2009, respectively.  

 For 2010, Outdoor reported operating income of $13.9 million versus an operating loss of $96.9 million for 2009. Outdoor OIBDA increased 56% to $262.8 million for 2010 from $168.7 million for 2009 and Outdoor OIBDA margins increased to 14% for 2010 from 10% for 2009. These increases were driven by the revenue growth as well as lower billboard lease, maintenance and display site costs from cost-savings initiatives and lost contracts, partially offset by costs for new transit contracts and higher restructuring charges. Restructuring charges of $25.8 million for 2010 primarily reflect severance costs associated with the elimination of positions in Europe partially offset by a reversal of $.9 million due to changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. Outdoor results included stock-based compensation expense of $5.1 million for 2010 and $5.6 million for 2009.  

 Outdoor's franchise and lease costs are generally fixed in nature and, due to the soft advertising marketplace worldwide, certain transit contracts, including the London Underground contract, which also

has generated reduced revenues due to transit project delays, are operating at the minimum franchise fee guaranteed by Outdoor therefore adversely impacting OIBDA and operating income margins.  

 Capital expenditures decreased $13.0 million to $78.0 million in 2010 from $91.0 million in 2009 principally reflecting decreased spending for transit contracts in the United Kingdom.  

 2009 vs. 2008  

 For 2009, Outdoor revenues decreased 21% to $1.72 billion from $2.17 billion for 2008, due to lower advertising sales resulting from a weak advertising marketplace worldwide and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Revenues for the Americas decreased 16% primarily due to revenue declines of 16% in the U.S. billboards business, 17% in the U.S. displays business and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. In constant dollars, revenues for the Americas decreased 15% from 2008. Europe revenues decreased 27% and Asia revenues decreased 39% both driven by lower advertising sales due to a weak advertising marketplace. The revenue decline in Europe also reflected the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. In constant dollars, revenues for Europe decreased 19% from 2008. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes on total Outdoor revenues was approximately $97 million for 2009. Approximately 47% and 50% of Outdoor revenues were generated from regions outside the U.S. for 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

 For 2009, Outdoor reported an operating loss of $96.9 million versus an operating loss of $2.63 billion for 2008, which included a non-cash impairment charge of $2.86 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets. Outdoor OIBDA before impairment charges decreased $298.7 million, or 64%, to $168.7 million for 2009 from $467.4 million for 2008 principally driven by the decline in advertising sales partially offset by lower employee-related costs resulting from restructuring and cost-savings initiatives. The restructuring charges of $17.2 million for 2009 primarily reflected severance costs associated with the elimination of positions in Europe and contract termination and other associated costs partially offset by a reversal of $1.7 million due to changes in estimates of previously established restructuring accruals. Outdoor results included stock-based compensation expense of $5.6 million for 2009 and $7.3 million for 2008.  

 Capital expenditures decreased $104.7 million to $91.0 million in 2009 from $195.7 million in 2008 primarily reflecting decreased spending for transit contracts in the United Kingdom.  

 Acquisitions  

 On April 23, 2008, the Company acquired International Outdoor Advertising Group ("IOA"), the leading out-of-home advertising company in South America, for $110.8 million.  

 Corporate  

 For 2010, corporate expenses increased 44% to $239.4 million from $166.0 million for 2009 primarily reflecting the absence of the 2009 favorable impact from the termination of a real estate lease arrangement, higher stock-based compensation and higher incentive compensation. For 2009, corporate expenses decreased 3% to $166.0 million from $170.3 million for 2008, primarily reflecting the favorable impact from the termination of a real estate lease arrangement partially offset by higher expenses, including higher stock-based compensation, resulting from an increase in the Company's stock price. Corporate expenses included stock-based compensation expense of $59.7 million for 2010, $55.3 million for 2009 and $43.4 million for 2008.

 Residual Costs  

 Residual costs primarily include pension and postretirement benefits costs for benefit plans retained by the Company for previously divested businesses. For 2010, residual costs decreased $100.8 million to $14.9 million from $115.7 million for 2009. Residual costs for 2010 and 2009 included settlements of $90.2 million and $28.0 million, respectively, related to the favorable resolutions of certain disputes regarding previously disposed businesses. The decrease in residual costs for 2010 is also driven by the favorable performance of pension plan assets in 2009. For 2009, residual costs increased 46% to $115.7 million from $79.2 million for 2008, primarily reflecting an increase in pension costs due to the unfavorable performance of pension plan assets in 2008, partially offset by the above-mentioned settlement of $28.0 million.  

 Financial Position  

 Current assets decreased by $302.2 million to $5.33 billion at December 31, 2010 from $5.64 billion at December 31, 2009, primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $236.7 million, a decrease in other current assets of $104.7 million and a decrease in programming and other inventory of $359.6 million, reflecting the timing of sports programming and a reduction in theatrical programming for cable networks, partially offset by an increase in receivables of $347.9 million. The increase in receivables reflects the inclusion of the Company's securitized receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet beginning in 2010 as a result of the adoption of new FASB guidance. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables decreased to 3.9% at December 31, 2010 compared with 4.7% at December 31, 2009.  

 Net property and equipment of $2.69 billion at December 31, 2010 decreased by $164.5 million from $2.86 billion at December 31, 2009, primarily reflecting depreciation expense of $432.4 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $284.3 million.  

 Goodwill decreased by $144.0 million to $8.52 billion at December 31, 2010 from $8.67 billion at December 31, 2009 primarily reflecting the establishment of deferred tax assets associated with liabilities assumed from previous acquisitions.  

 Intangible assets, principally consisting of FCC licenses, leasehold agreements and franchise agreements, decreased by $129.9 million to $6.62 billion at December 31, 2010 from $6.75 billion at December 31, 2009 due to amortization expense of $129.9 million.  

 Current liabilities decreased by $721.0 million to $4.03 billion at December 31, 2010 from $4.75 billion at December 31, 2009, primarily due to a decrease in the current portion of long-term debt of $416.3 million, reflecting the redemption of debt due in 2010, a decrease in deferred revenue of $170.0 million and a decrease in program rights obligations of $128.1 million.  

 Other liabilities decreased $149.8 million to $2.52 billion at December 31, 2010 from $2.67 billion at December 31, 2009, primarily reflecting lower program rights obligations.

 Cash Flows  

 Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $236.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased by $297.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 and decreased by $927.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The changes in cash and cash equivalents were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Operating Activities. In 2010, cash provided by operating activities increased $795.7 million to $1.74 billion from $939.4 million in 2009 principally reflecting higher operating income, the timing of programming payments and a $150.0 million reduction to amounts outstanding under the company's accounts receivable securitization program during 2009, partially offset by higher payments for taxes and higher discretionary contributions to pre-fund the Company's qualified pension plans. On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted amended FASB guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets and as a result, decreases to the accounts receivable securitization program during 2010 are reflected as cash flows used for financing activities.  

 In 2009, cash provided by operating activities decreased $1.21 billion, to $939.4 million from $2.15 billion in 2008 principally reflecting lower advertising sales, higher investment in content, and a $150.0 million reduction to amounts outstanding under the revolving accounts receivable securitization program, partially offset by lower employee-related payments due to restructuring activities and lower cash taxes paid.  

 The Company made discretionary contributions to pre-fund its qualified pension plans for $167.0 million in 2010, $20.0 million in 2009 and $120.0 million in 2008.  

 Cash paid for income taxes was $248.2 million for 2010, $55.8 million for 2009 and $240.3 million for 2008. The increase in cash taxes for 2010 reflects higher taxable income and the impact of refunds received during 2009 resulting from the filing of income tax returns for prior years. The decrease in cash taxes for 2009 reflects lower taxable income and the impact of tax refunds received during 2009.  

 Investing Activities. In 2010, cash used for investing activities of $367.5 million principally reflected capital expenditures of $284.3 million and investments in investee companies of $89.9 million, principally reflecting investment in The CW and new international television ventures, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $18.3 million, primarily from the sale of a television station. In 2009, cash used for investing activities of $249.2 million principally reflected capital expenditures of $261.6 million, investments in investee companies of $55.6 million, principally reflecting investment in The CW, and purchases of marketable securities of $35.6 million, partially offset by proceeds from dispositions of $128.8 million, primarily from the sales of radio stations and certain long-lived assets of the Local Broadcasting segment. In 2008, cash used for investing activities of $2.15 billion principally reflected acquisitions of $2.04 billion, primarily consisting of the acquisitions of CNET, IOA and other outdoor advertising properties, capital expenditures of $474.1 million, and investments in investee companies of $40.2 million. These cash uses were partially offset by proceeds received of $170.0 million from the sale of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

the Company's investment in Sundance Channel and dispositions of $198.2 million, primarily from television station divestitures.  

 Capital expenditures were $284.3 million in 2010 and $261.6 million in 2009 versus $474.1 million in 2008. The decline in capital expenditure levels since 2008 is due to spending in 2008 for transit contracts in the United Kingdom. For 2011, capital expenditures are anticipated to be similar to 2010 and 2009 levels.  

 Financing Activities. In 2010, cash used for financing activities of $1.60 billion principally reflected the repayment of notes and debentures of $2.13 billion, a $400.0 million reduction to amounts outstanding under the account receivable securitization program and dividend payments of $141.7 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $1.09 billion. In 2009, cash used for financing activities of $393.0 million principally reflected the repayment of senior debt of $1.01 billion and dividend payments of $297.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $974.4 million. In 2008, cash used for financing activities of $919.8 million principally reflected dividend payments of $705.4 million and the repayment of senior notes of $183.2 million.  

 Dividends  

 On February 23, 2011, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $.05 per share on its Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2011. The Company declared a quarterly cash dividend on its Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the four quarters of 2010, 2009 and 2008, resulting in total annual dividends of $139.2 million, $135.8 million and $725.9 million, respectively. Dividends have been recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital as the Company has an accumulated deficit balance.  

 Share Repurchase Program  

 On November 4, 2010, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a $1.5 billion share repurchase program with respect to its Class A and Class B Common Stock. In January 2011, the Company began using this program to repurchase shares of CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock. The Company expects to complete this share repurchase program in approximately eighteen months, subject to market conditions. In connection with the approval of this program, the Company's previous share repurchase programs, which had remaining authorization of $649.4 million, were terminated.

 Capital Structure  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a)At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the senior debt balances included (i) a net unamortized premium of $1.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively, and (ii) an increase in the carrying value of the debt relating to previously settled fair value hedges of $82.5 million and $92.4 million, respectively. The face value of the Company's total debt was $5.94 billion at December 31, 2010 and $6.92 billion at December 31, 2009. 

(b)Included in "Liabilities of discontinued operations" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.   

 Total debt of $6.02 billion at December 31, 2010 and $7.02 billion at December 31, 2009 was 38% and 44%, respectively, as a percentage of the total capitalization of the Company.  

 The senior debt of CBS Corp., is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by its wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Operations Inc. Senior debt in the amount of $52.2 million of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, CBS Broadcasting Inc., is not guaranteed.  

 In November 2009, prior to maturity, the Company settled $350.0 million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding and received $9.9 million in cash. In December 2008, prior to maturity, the Company settled $1.0 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding and received $88.4 million in cash. The increase in the carrying value of the debt attributable to the risk hedged by these interest rate swaps is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the term of the debt. The Company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009.  

 For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, debt issuances, redemptions and repurchases were as follows:  

 Debt Issuances   

October 2010, $300.0 million 4.30% senior notes due 2021

 October 2010, $300.0 million 5.90% senior notes due 2040

 April 2010, $500.0 million 5.75% senior notes due 2020

 June 2009, $250.0 million 8.875% senior notes due 2019

 May 2009, $350.0 million 8.875% senior notes due 2019

 May 2009, $400.0 million 8.20% senior notes due 2014

 These transactions resulted in a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $81.4 million and $29.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  

 At December 31, 2010, the Company's scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding capital leases were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 Credit Facility  

 At December 31, 2010, the Company had a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility which expires in December 2012 (the "Credit Facility"). The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the Company's option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the United States or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Company's senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments.  

 The Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.0x at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010, subject to future reductions, and a minimum Consolidated Coverage Ratio of 3.0x for the trailing four quarters, each as further described in the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2010, the Company's Consolidated Leverage Ratio was approximately 2.3x and Consolidated Coverage Ratio was approximately 5.3x.  

 The Consolidated Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of the Company's indebtedness from continuing operations, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, at the end of a quarter, to the Company's  

II-27 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four consecutive quarters. Consolidated EBITDA is defined in the Credit Facility as operating income plus interest income and before depreciation, amortization and certain other non-cash items. The Consolidated Coverage Ratio reflects the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to the Company's cash interest expense on indebtedness, adjusted to exclude certain capital lease obligations, in each case for the trailing four consecutive quarters.  

 The primary purpose of the Credit Facility is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2010, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings under its $2.0 billion commercial paper program. At December 31, 2010, the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $1.98 billion.  

 Accounts Receivable Securitization Program  

 The Company participated in a revolving accounts receivable securitization program which provided for the sale of receivables on a non-recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one-year renewable basis. During the first quarter of 2010, the Company reduced the amounts outstanding under its revolving accounts receivable securitization program to zero from $400.0 million at December 31, 2009 and terminated the program.  

 On January 1, 2010, the Company adopted amended FASB guidance on the accounting for transfers of financial assets which required the Company's securitized accounts receivables to be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding increase to debt. As a result, the decrease to the accounts receivable securitization program of $400.0 million during 2010 is reflected as cash flows used for financing activities and the decrease of $150.0 million during 2009 is reflected as cash flows used for operating activities under previous FASB guidance.  

 During the period before the termination of the program in 2010 and for the year ended December 31, 2009, proceeds from collections of securitized accounts receivables of $263.1 million and $1.47 billion, respectively, were reinvested in the revolving receivable securitization program. The net loss associated with securitizing the program's accounts receivables was $.5 million for 2010 and $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements for its operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. The Company's operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, franchise payments, interest payments, and pension funding obligations. The Company's investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness. The Company believes that its operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under its Credit Facility, which had $1.98 billion of remaining availability at December 31, 2010 and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.  

 The Company's funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to the Company, the existing Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs.  

 Funding for the Company's long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of $990.7 million is expected to come from cash generated from operating activities and the Company's ability to refinance its debt.

 Contractual Obligations  

 As of December 31, 2010 the Company's significant contractual obligations, including payments due by period were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a)Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include $3.92 billion for sports programming rights, $3.29 billion relating to television, radio, and film production and licensing and $777.1 million for talent contracts. 

(b)Outdoor has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media including transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in-car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage and in retail stores. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. 

(c)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. 

(d)Consists of long-term operating lease commitments for office space, billboards, equipment, transponders and studio facilities. Total future minimum payments of $2.37 billion include $898.7 million for Outdoor billboards. 

(e)Long-term contractual obligations including program liabilities, participations due to producers and residuals. 

(f)Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, including discontinued operations debt. 

(g)Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases. 

(h)Includes capital leases for satellite transponders.   

 The table above excludes future contributions to the Company's pension plans and $213.7 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the amount of and periods in which cash payments relating to these items are expected to occur. In 2011, the Company expects to contribute a minimum of $130 million to its pension plans. The Company, at its discretion, may make additional contributions in 2011 to pre-fund its qualified pension plans. Also in 2011, the Company expects to contribute approximately $83 million to its other postretirement benefit plans.  

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2010, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $386.1 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 Prior to the separation of former Viacom Inc. into CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. on December 31, 2005, former Viacom had entered into guarantees with respect to obligations related to Blockbuster Inc. ("Blockbuster"), including certain Blockbuster store leases; Famous Players theater leases; certain UCI theater leases; and certain theater leases related to W.F. Cinema Holdings L.P. In connection with the separation, Viacom Inc. has agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these guarantees. In addition, the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to indemnify each other with respect to certain other matters pursuant to the separation agreement between the parties.  

 In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable under generally accepted accounting principles.  

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.  

 The Company considers the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company's significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.  

 Programming and Production Costs  

 Accounting for television and theatrical film production costs requires management's judgment as it relates to total estimated revenues to be earned ("Ultimate Revenues") and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or theatrical film. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized production costs. For each television program or theatrical film, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs or theatrical films.  

 The costs incurred in acquiring television programs are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing and expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. Management's judgment is required in determining the timing of the expensing of these costs, which is dependent on the economic benefit expected to be generated from the program.  

 Ultimate revenue estimates for internally produced television programming and theatrical films, and the estimated economic benefit for acquired programming are updated regularly based on information  

II-30 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

available as the television program and theatrical film progresses through its life cycle. Overestimating ultimate revenues or a failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production or programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and estimated accruals for participation expense.  

 Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

 The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily comprised of FCC licenses, for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test.  

 Goodwill  

 Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below or the same as an operating segment. The first step of the goodwill impairment test examines whether the book value of each of the Company's reporting units exceeds its fair value. If the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the test requires the Company to then compare the implied fair value of that reporting unit's goodwill with the book value of its goodwill to determine the amount of impairment charge, if any. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is computed based upon the present value of future cash flows ("Discounted Cash Flow Method") and both the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses ("Market Comparable Method"). The Discounted Cash Flow Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows over a discrete projection period to the residual value of the business at the end of the projection period. This technique requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions such as growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures and discount rates. The estimated growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for the projection period are based on the Company's internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The residual value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation in the U.S. and long-term industry projections, and for 2010 was between 2.0% and 3.5%. The discount rates, which for 2010 ranged from 8.0% to 11.0%, are determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market or a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values. The Company would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any non-cash impairment charge. Such a charge could have a material effect on the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet.  

 Based on the 2010 annual impairment test, the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units exceeded their respective book values. The individual carrying values of the following reporting units with significant goodwill balances were within 10% of their respective estimated fair values:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

II-31 

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 At December 31, 2010, the book value of goodwill for the CBS Interactive and CBS Radio reporting units was $883.8 million and $1.88 billion, respectively. An increase to the discount rates of 40 basis points and 60 basis points for Interactive and Radio, respectively, or a decrease to the perpetual nominal growth rates of 60 basis points and 80 basis points for Interactive and Radio, respectively, assuming no changes to other factors, would cause the fair values of these reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values. The Company would then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of any non-cash impairment charge.  

 FCC Licenses  

 FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset by geographic market with its book value. The Company considers each geographic market, which is comprised of all of the Company's radio or television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. The estimated fair value of each FCC license is computed using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method ("Greenfield Method"), which attempts to isolate the income that is attributable to the license alone. The Greenfield Method is based upon modeling a hypothetical start-up station and building it up to a normalized operation that, by design, lacks inherent goodwill and whose other assets have essentially been added as part of the build-up process. The Greenfield Method adds the present value of the estimated annual cash flows of the start-up station over a projection period to the residual value at the end of the projection period. The annual cash flows over the projection period include assumptions for overall advertising revenues in the relevant geographic market, the start-up station's operating costs and capital expenditures, and a three-year build-up period for the start-up station to reach a normalized state of operations, which reflects the point at which it achieves an average market share. In order to estimate the revenues of a start-up station, the total market advertising revenue in the subject market is estimated based on recent industry projections. Operating costs and capital expenditures are similarly estimated based on industry-average data. The residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation in the U.S. and long-term industry projections. The discount rate is determined based on the average of the weighted average cost of capital of comparable entities in the broadcast industry.  

 The discount rates and perpetual nominal growth rates used for each radio and television station for 2010 were as follows:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

 The assumptions used in determining fair values of the FCC licenses require management to make significant judgments. Certain events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital or a decline in the local radio or television advertising markets, could result in changes to these assumptions and judgments. The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which the Company owns and operates television and radio stations. Deterioration in the economic conditions or a change in population size of any individual geographic market could adversely impact advertisers' ability or willingness to purchase advertising on the radio and television stations in that market. Advertising expenditures by companies in certain industries, including automotive, entertainment and

 Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

retail, have historically represented a significant portion of the local radio and television advertising revenues in all geographic markets. As a result, a decrease in spending by advertisers in these categories or adverse economic conditions, particularly in larger markets such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and San Francisco, where the Company holds FCC licenses with substantial carrying values, could have a significant impact on the fair value of the FCC licenses.  

 Based on the 2010 annual impairment test, the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses in each radio and television market exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was necessary. However, eight radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $1.63 billion, were each within 5% of their respective estimated fair value, and five radio markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $589.3 million, were each within 10% of their respective estimated fair value. Additionally, three television markets, which had an aggregate carrying value of FCC licenses of $596.3 million, were each within 10% of their respective estimated fair value. In each of the remaining radio and television markets, the estimated fair value of FCC licenses was in excess of the respective carrying values at December 31, 2010 by more than 10%. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a non-cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

 Reserves and Legal Matters  

 Estimates of reserves and liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims.  

 Pensions  

 Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the weighted average return of high quality bond portfolios, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet each of the Company's pension plans' expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2010, the unrecognized actuarial losses decreased from the prior year end, due primarily to an increase in plan asset values. A decrease in the discount rate or a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would be a change of approximately $3 million in 2011 pension expense and will change the projected benefit obligation by approximately $90 million. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $9 million in 2011 pension expense.

 Income Taxes  

 The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording the worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. During 2010 and 2009, the Company recognized tax benefits of $28.1 million and $47.0 million, respectively, related to the net impact of the settlement of certain prior year tax audits. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, the Company evaluates each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $213.7 million at December 31, 2010 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.  

 Stock-based Compensation  

 The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. For each award of employee stock options the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of option grants and the related expense. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury rate in effect on the date of grant with a term equal to the expected life. The expected term is determined based on historical employee exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected dividend yield is based on the then current annual dividend rate. The expected stock price volatility is determined using a weighted average of historical volatility and implied volatility of publicly traded options to purchase CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock. Given the existence of an actively traded market for CBS Corp. options, the Company was able to derive implied volatility using publicly traded options to purchase CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock that were trading near the grant date of the employee stock options at a similar exercise price and a remaining term of greater than one year.

 Legal Matters  

 Securities Action. On December 12, 2008, the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System filed a self-styled class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company and its Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, and Treasurer, alleging violations of federal securities law. The complaint, which was filed on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of the Company's common stock between February 26, 2008 and October 10, 2008 (the "Class Period"), alleges that, among other things, the Company's failure to timely write down the value of certain assets caused the Company's reported operating results during the Class Period to be materially inflated. The plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages. On February 11, 2009, a motion was filed in the case on behalf of The City of Omaha, Nebraska Civilian Employees' Retirement System, and The City of Omaha Police and Fire Retirement System (collectively, the "Omaha Funds") seeking to appoint the Omaha Funds as the lead plaintiffs in this case; on March 5, 2009, the court granted that motion. On May 4, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint, which removes the Treasurer as a defendant and adds the Executive Chairman. On July 13, 2009, all defendants filed a motion to dismiss this action. On March 16, 2010, the court granted the Company's motion and dismissed this action as to the Company and all defendants. On April 30, 2010, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to serve an amended complaint. On September 23, 2010, the court issued an order granting leave to amend. On October 8, 2010, the Company was served with an Amended Complaint, which redefines the Class Period to be April 29, 2008 to October 10, 2008 and alleges that the impairment charge should have been taken during the first quarter of 2008. The Company filed a motion to dismiss this Amended Complaint on November 19, 2010. The Company believes that the plaintiffs' claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself in the litigation.  

 Indecency Regulation. In March 2006, the FCC released certain decisions relating to indecency complaints against certain of the Company's owned television stations and affiliated stations. The FCC ordered the Company to pay a forfeiture of $550,000 in the proceeding relating to the broadcast of a Super Bowl half-time show by the Company's television stations (the "Super Bowl Proceeding"). In May 2006, the FCC denied the Company's petition for reconsideration. In July 2006, the Company filed a Petition for Review of the forfeiture with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and paid the $550,000 forfeiture in order to facilitate the Company's ability to bring the appeal. Oral argument was heard in September 2007. In July 2008, the Third Circuit vacated the FCC's order to have the Company pay the forfeiture and remanded the case to the FCC. On November 18, 2008, the FCC filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, seeking review of the Third Circuit's decision. The petition requested that the United States Supreme Court not act on the petition until it ruled in the "fleeting expletives case" mentioned below. On January 8, 2009, the Company filed its opposition to the FCC's petition for certiorari.  

 In another case involving broadcasts on another network, in June 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the FCC's November 2006 finding that the broadcast of fleeting and isolated expletives was indecent and remanded the case to the FCC (the "fleeting expletives case"). On March 17, 2008, the United States Supreme Court granted the FCC's petition to review the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit's decision. On November 4, 2008, the United States Supreme Court heard argument in this case. On April 28, 2009, the United States Supreme Court issued a 5-4 decision reversing the Second Circuit's judgment on administrative grounds in favor of the FCC and remanding the fleeting expletives case to the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit requested additional briefing and argument was heard on January 13, 2010. On July 13, 2010, the Second Circuit struck down an FCC policy on indecency and found that the FCC's indecency policies and decisions regarding the use of

"fleeting expletives" on radio and television violated the First Amendment. On August 25, 2010, the FCC filed a petition for rehearing en banc and, on August 31, 2010, the Second Circuit issued an order directing all parties and intervenors to file briefs in response to the FCC's petition on September 21, 2010, which were filed. On November 22, 2010, the Second Circuit denied the FCC's petition for rehearing.  

 Following the April 28, 2009 decision in the fleeting expletives case, on May 4, 2009, the United States Supreme Court remanded the Super Bowl Proceeding to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and requested supplemental briefing from the Company and the FCC, in light of the United States Supreme Court's fleeting expletives decision. Argument was heard by the Third Circuit in the Super Bowl Proceeding on February 23, 2010. On May 18, 2010 and on December 22, 2010, at the Third Circuit's request, the Company and the FCC each submitted supplemental briefs. The parties are awaiting a decision from the Third Circuit.  

 In March 2006, the FCC also notified the Company and certain affiliates of the CBS Television Network of apparent liability for forfeitures relating to a broadcast of the program  Without a Trace. The FCC proposed to assess a forfeiture of $32,500 against each of these stations, totaling $260,000 for the Company's owned stations. The Company is contesting the FCC decision and the proposed forfeitures.  

 Additionally, the Company, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on the Company's broadcasting stations included indecent material.  

 Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company's products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships.  

 Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had pending approximately 52,220 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 62,360 as of December 31, 2009 and 68,520 as of December 31, 2008. During 2010, the Company received approximately 5,170 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 15,310 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company's total costs for the years 2010 and 2009 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $13.7 million and $17.8 million, respectively. The Company's costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year as insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

 Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of claims against the Company are non-cancer claims. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities. This belief is based upon many factors and assumptions, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims. While the number of asbestos claims filed against the Company has trended down in recent years, it is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may occur including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims, which could affect the Company's estimate of its asbestos liabilities.  

 Other. The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.  

 CBS Outdoor Limited has commenced legal actions against London Underground Limited with respect to disputes regarding project delays and other matters, including the calculation of franchise fees due from CBS Outdoor Limited arising under its 2006 transit contract with London Underground Limited. In these actions, CBS Outdoor Limited is seeking recovery of monetary damages and other forms of relief. In August 2010, CBS Outdoor Limited filed a claim against London Underground Limited in the High Court of Justice Queen's Bench Division Commercial Court in the U.K. and, in November 2010, London Underground Limited filed a defense and counterclaim against CBS Outdoor Limited, in each case, with respect to such franchise fee calculation disputes.  

 On an ongoing basis, the Company defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state and local authorities (collectively, "litigation"). Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the above-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.  

 Market Risk  

 The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify its exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

 Foreign Exchange Risk   

 The Company conducts business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows, generally within the next twelve months, in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge projected future television and film production costs as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, the Company enters into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in "Other items, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.  

 At December 31, 2010, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $113.9 million, of which $2.0 million relates to the hedging of future production costs and $111.9 million represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows. At December 31, 2009, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $97.1 million, of which $2.1 million relates to the hedging of future production costs and $95.0 million represents hedges of expected foreign currency cash flows.   

 Interest Rate Risk   

 All of the Company's long-term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements. The Company had entered into fixed-to-floating rate swap agreements for a portion of this debt, which were designated as fair value hedges. In November 2009, prior to maturity, the Company settled its $350.0 million notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding and received $9.9 million in cash. The Company did not have any interest rate swaps outstanding at December 31, 2010 and 2009.   

 Credit Risk   

 The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.  

 The Company's receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2010 or 2009, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company's products and services are sold.

 Adoption of New Accounting Standards  

 Variable Interest Entities  

 Effective January 1, 2010, the Company adopted revised FASB guidance which changes the model for determining whether an entity should consolidate a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE"). This new model requires an assessment of whether an entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE and is therefore the primary beneficiary and required to consolidate the VIE. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  

 Transfers of Financial Assets  

 Effective January 1, 2010, the Company prospectively adopted amended FASB guidance on accounting for transfers of financial assets. This amended guidance removes the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity, establishes specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale, and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset, or portion of a financial asset, should be derecognized when the transferor has not transferred the entire original financial asset and/or when the transferor has continuing involvement with the transferred financial asset. The adoption of this guidance required the Company's securitized accounts receivables to be recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding increase to debt. As part of its effort to decrease debt and interest expense, the Company reduced the amounts outstanding under its revolving accounts receivable securitization program during the first quarter of 2010, from $400.0 million at December 31, 2009 to zero and terminated the program.  

 Recent Pronouncements  

 Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables  

 In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2011. This guidance establishes a hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable in a multiple element arrangement. The selling price used for each deliverable will be based on Company-specific objective evidence if available, third party evidence if Company-specific evidence is not available, or estimated selling price if neither Company-specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available. This guidance requires the best estimate of the selling price that would be used to sell the deliverable on a stand-alone basis. The adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
