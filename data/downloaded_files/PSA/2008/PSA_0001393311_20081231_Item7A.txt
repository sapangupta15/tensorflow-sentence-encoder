ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
          ----------------------------------------------------------

     To limit our exposure to market risk, we principally finance our operations
and growth with permanent equity capital  consisting either of common shares and
preferred  shares.  At December  31,  2008,  our debt as a  percentage  of total
shareholders' equity (based on book values) was 7.4%.

     Our preferred  shares are not  redeemable at the option of the holders.  At
December  31,  2008,  our Series V,  Series W and Series X shares are  currently
redeemable  by us.  Except under  certain  conditions  relating to the Company's
qualification  as a REIT, the preferred shares are not redeemable by the Company
pursuant to its redemption  option prior to the dates set forth in Note 8 to our
December 31, 2008 consolidated financial statements.

     Our market risk sensitive instruments include notes payable,  which totaled
$643,811,000 at December 31, 2008.

     We have foreign  currency  exposures  related to our investment in Shurgard
Europe,  which has a book value of $264.1  million at December 31, 2008. We also
have a loan  receivable  from Shurgard  Europe,  which is  denominated in Euros,
totaling (euro)391.9 million ($552.4 million) at December 31, 2008. We also have
an obligation,  in certain circumstances,  to loan up to an additional (euro)305
million to Shurgard Europe.

     The table below  summarizes  annual debt  maturities  and  weighted-average
interest rates on our  outstanding  debt at the end of each year and fair values
required to evaluate  our  expected  cash-flows  under debt  agreements  and our
sensitivity  to interest  rate changes at December  31, 2008 (dollar  amounts in
thousands).
