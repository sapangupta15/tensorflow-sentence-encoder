ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

 Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risks. United's exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to its debt obligations and short-term investments. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. United's policy is to manage interest rate risk through a combination of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into swap agreements, depending upon market conditions. A portion of United's aircraft lease obligations ($497 million in equivalent U.S. dollars at December 31, 2007) is denominated in foreign currencies that expose the Company to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. To hedge against some of this risk, United has placed foreign currency deposits (primarily for euros) to meet foreign currency lease obligations denominated in those respective currencies. Since unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses on the foreign currency deposits are offset by the losses or gains on the foreign currency obligations, United has hedged its overall exposure to foreign currency exchange rate volatility with respect to its foreign lease deposits and obligations. The fair value of these deposits is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using an appropriate swap rate. The fair value of long-term debt is predominantly based on the present value of future cash flows using a U.S. Treasury rate that matches the remaining life of the instrument, adjusted by a credit spread and, to a lesser extent, on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. The table below presents information as of December 31, 2007 about certain of the Company's financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest and exchange rates. Amounts shown below are the same for both UAL and United, except as noted.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

(a)Amounts also represent United except that United's carrying value and fair value of variable rate debt is approximately $3 million lower than the reported UAL amounts and United's cash equivalents and short-term investments are approximately $56 million lower than the reported UAL amounts.

 In addition to the cash equivalents and short-term investments included in the table above, UAL and United have $325 million and $291 million of short-term restricted cash, respectively, and each has $431 million of long-term restricted cash. As discussed in Note 2(e), "Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesÂ—Cash and Cash Equivalents, Short-Term Investments and Restricted Cash" in the Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, this cash is being held in restricted accounts for workers' compensation obligations, security deposits for airport leases and reserves with institutions that process United's credit card ticket sales. Due to the short term nature of these cash balances, the carrying values approximate the fair values. The Company's interest income is exposed to changes in interest rates on these cash balances. During 2007, the Company also repurchased certain of its own debt instruments, which remain outstanding at December 31, 2007, with a fair value and carrying value of $91 million. The Company recognizes changes in fair value of these securities through other comprehensive income; however, on a net basis, the Company is not exposed to market risk due to offsetting changes in the fair value of the Company's debt obligations.  

 Price Risk (Aircraft Fuel). United enters into fuel option contracts and futures contracts to reduce its price risk exposure to jet fuel. These contracts are designed to provide protection against sharp increases in the price of aircraft fuel. The Company may update its hedging strategy in response to changes in market conditions. The fair value of the Company's fuel related derivatives was $20 million at December 31, 2007. These instruments have a maturity of less than one year.  

 Foreign Currency. United generates revenues and incurs expenses in numerous foreign currencies. Such expenses include fuel, aircraft leases, commissions, catering, personnel expense, advertising and distribution costs, customer service expenses and aircraft maintenance. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the Company's results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currency-denominated operating revenues and expenses.  

 Despite the adverse effects a strengthening foreign currency may have on demand for U.S.-originating traffic, a strengthening of foreign currencies tends to increase reported revenue and operating income because the Company's foreign currency-denominated operating revenue generally exceeds its foreign currency-denominated operating expense for each currency. Likewise, despite the favorable effects a weakening foreign currency may have on demand for U.S.-originating traffic, a weakening of foreign currencies tends to decrease reported revenue and operating income.  

 The Company's most significant net foreign currency exposures in 2007, based on exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2007, are presented in the table below:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 In 2007, the Company began using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2007, the Company hedged a portion of its expected foreign currency cash flows in the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, European Euro and Japanese yen. As of December 31, 2007, the notional amount of these foreign currencies hedged with the forward contracts in U.S. dollars terms was approximately $346 million. These contracts had a fair value of $1 million at December 31, 2007 and expire at various dates through December 2008. The Company did not have any outstanding foreign currency derivatives at December 31, 2006.
