ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate and floating-rate long-term debt. At September 30, 2014, we had borrowings under our 2014 Credit Facility of $3.87 billion that were subject to interest rate risk. Borrowings under our 2014 Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBO rate for a one-, two-, three- or six-month (or to the extent available to each lender, nine- or twelve-month) interest period chosen by us, in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. Accordingly, the CompanyÂ’s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our 2014 Credit Facility. The effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our 2014 Credit Facility by approximately $38.7 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2014. The weighted average interest rate on the $3.87 billion of borrowings under our 2013 Credit Facility on September 30, 2014 was 3.8%.

At September 30, 2014, three forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were in place to swap variable rates on the 2014 Credit Facility for a fixed rate based on an aggregate notional amount of $353 million. These interest rate swap agreement converted the variable interest rate on the aggregate notional amount of the 2014 Credit Facility to a fixed rate of 5.17% (2.17% plus the 3% margin percentage) through June 30, 2015.  

On July 16, 2013, the Company entered into three forward-starting interest rate swap agreements beginning September 30, 2014 to hedge the variable interest rates on the 2014 Credit Facility for a fixed rate based on an aggregate notional amount of $1.0 billion through June 30, 2019. These forward-starting interest rate swap agreements will effectively convert the variable interest rate on the aggregate notional amount of the 2014 Credit Facility to a fixed rate of 5.4% (2.4% plus the 3% margin percentage) over the term of the interest rate swap agreements.  

On July 24, 2014, the Company entered into five forward-starting interest rate swap agreements beginning March 31, 2016 to hedge the variable interest rates on the 2014 Credit Facility for a fixed rate based on an aggregate notional amount of $750 million through June 30, 2020. These forward-starting interest rate swap agreements will effectively convert the variable interest rate on the aggregate notional amount of the 2014 Credit Facility to a fixed rate of 5.8% (2.8% plus the 3% margin percentage) over the term of the interest rate swap agreements.  

The fair value of the $3.87 billion aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our 2014 Credit Facility is exposed to the market risk of interest rates. The estimated fair value of such term loan approximated $3.82 billion at September 30, 2014 based upon information provided to the Company from its agent under the 2014 Credit Facility. The fair value of our $0.55 billion 2020 Notes, our $0.50 billion 2021 Notes, our $1.15 billion 2022 Notes and our $1.2 billion 2024 Notes are exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes. The estimated fair value of the 2020 Notes approximated $0.53 billion, the estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes approximated $0.53 billion, the estimated fair value of the 2022 Notes approximated $1.12 billion and the estimated fair value of the 2024 Notes approximated $1.18 billion at September 30, 2014 based upon quoted market rates.
