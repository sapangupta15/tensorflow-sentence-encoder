Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading, speculation or other purposes that would expose the Company to market risk. In the normal course of business, our results of operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates.  

Interest Rate Risk  

Our only committed source for long-term credit is a $290.0 million syndicated revolving credit facility. The total amount outstanding under this facility at September 30, 2008 was $55.7 million. This agreement expires in May 2012, and provides for both fixed-rate and variable-rate borrowings. Our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows, and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we continuously monitor changes in interest rates, and use cash provided from operations to re-pay our borrowings as quickly as possible. Furthermore, the Company can use a combination of both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk.

Foreign Currency Risk  

In situations where our operations incur contract costs in currencies other than their functional currency, we attempt to have a portion of the related contract revenues denominated in the same currencies as the costs. In those situations where revenues and costs are transacted in different currencies, we sometimes enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to limit our exposure to fluctuating foreign currencies. We follow the provisions of SFAS 133 in accounting for our derivative contracts.  

At September 30, 2008, we had a Euro put option outstanding with a notional amount of 7.5 million with an average exchange rate of 1.4461 EUR-to-GBP. This derivative contract expires in October of 2009. Weve determined this contract to be highly effective according to the provisions of SFAS 133. The contract is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income.  

At September 30, 2008, we had a Euro forward contract outstanding with a notional amount of 6.2 million with an average exchange rate of 1.2599 EUR-to-GBP. This derivative contract expires in April of 2009. Weve determined this contract to be highly effective according to the provisions of SFAS 133. The contract is recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income.  

Concurrent with the fiscal 2004 acquisition of the Babtie Group Limited, we entered into a forward contract with a large U.S. bank. The purpose of the contract is to hedge the Companys exposure to fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates on a £39.9 million intercompany loan between Jacobs and one of its subsidiaries. Based on the terms of the contract, we believe the effect of the loan on future earnings at September 30, 2008 should be limited to $2.0 million of expense, of which $0.7 million will be recognized in the next 12 months. We recorded $0.7 million of expense during fiscal 2008. At September 30, 2008, the notional amount of the contract was £39.9 million. It provides for an average exchange rate of 0.5828 GBP-to-USD, and expires in June of 2011. We have determined that this derivative qualifies as a cash flow hedge under the provisions of SFAS 133.  

The fair value of derivative contracts included in other deferred liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets totaled $3.0 million and $8.6 million at September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively.
