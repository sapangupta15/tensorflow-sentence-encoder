ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Certain tabular information will not foot due to rounding.  

Business Overview  Fastenal is a North American leader in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. We operate stores primarily located in North America. On December 31, 2009, we operated 2,369 company-owned or leased store locations.  

Most of our customers are in the manufacturing and construction markets. The manufacturing market includes both original equipment manufacturers and maintenance and repair operations. The construction market includes general, electrical, plumbing, sheet metal, and road contractors. Other users of our products include farmers, truckers, railroads, mining companies, federal, state, and local governmental entities, schools, and certain retail trades. Geographically, our customers are primarily located in North America.

Similar to our first three quarterly reports in 2009, this annual reports discussion contains some additional points not typically covered in our reports in previous years. We believe these are important aspects that require added emphasis.  

As we saw in the previous fifteen months, the weakened economy continues to have a substantial impact on our business. These impacts continue to negatively affect our sales, particularly related to our industrial production business (business where we supply products that become part of the finished goods produced by others) and, as the year progressed, our non-residential construction business. To place this in perspective  sales to our manufacturing customers (historically approximately 50% of sales) contracted approximately 10.1% in the fourth quarter and 18.8% for the year versus the same periods in 2008. This contraction is less severe in the maintenance portion of our manufacturing sales (business where we supply products that maintain the facility or the equipment of our customers engaged in manufacturing), but more severe in the production business. Our non-residential construction business (historically 20% to 25% of sales) contracted approximately 24.7% in the fourth quarter and 19.4% for the year versus the same periods in 2008. The remaining business (sales to other resellers, government business, transportation/warehousing, other industries, and in-store retail sales) produced better results as a group, but unfortunately, doesnt have enough impact to offset the manufacturing and construction impact. The annual 2009 sales growth/contraction compared to 2008 sales for the remaining business was as follows: Sales to other resellers  26% contraction, government business  16% growth, transportation/warehousing  3% contraction, all other industries combined  0% growth, and in-store retail sales  14% contraction.  

On a sequential basis, our daily average sales to our manufacturing customers improved each month since May 2009 (with the exception of July and December 2009 due to the holiday impact) versus the previous month. This trend was the first sequential improvement since September 2008. However, this improvement was partially offset by continued weakening in our non-residential construction business.  

Sometimes our comments are an effort to share our perspective regarding the trends with you, our shareholder. The discussion above is an attempt to provide insight into activities with types of customers and the discussion under the headings Financial Overview and Monthly Daily Sales Change later gives a somewhat mechanical view of our business. Another way to think about our business is to compare our growth during a year to the act of climbing a stairway. This stairway has several predictable landings (i.e. April, July, and October to December), but generally speaking, climbs from January to October. The October landing then establishes the benchmark for the start of the next year.  

History has identified these landings in our business cycle. They generally relate to months with impaired business days (i.e. certain holidays). The first landing centers on Easter, which alternates between March and April (it was in April in 2009), the second landing centers on July 4th, and the third landing centers on the approach of winter with its seasonal impact on primarily our construction business and on the Christmas / New Year holidays. The holidays we noted impact the trends because they either move from month-to-month or because they move around during the week.  

The table below shows the pattern to the sequential change in our daily sales (see definition of daily sales later in this report). The line labeled Past is an historical average of the results for the period 1998 to 2003. We chose this time frame because it had similar characteristics, a weaker industrial economy in North America, and could serve as a benchmark for a possible trend line. The 2009 line is our actual results and the Delta line is the difference between the Past and 2009.

In the October 2008 to January 2009 time frame, our economy dug a big hole, and pulled our sales results from daily average sales growth of 11.9% in October to a contraction of 8.5% in January. The Delta, or spread between the benchmark and the 2009 actual, in the February 2009 to April 2009 time frame averaged a negative 5.0%. This increased the daily sales contraction to 21.0% in April. The Delta from May 2009 to July 2009 was not as significant, averaging a negative 1.1%; while this period was still painful, it began to show what we believe was the bottom of the drop. Finally, in the period from August 2009 to December 2009, the Delta improved further, and averaged a positive 0.7%. Historically, we are hesitant to provide much forward looking commentary as we believe we are better able to provide value to our shareholders by managing the business and not by trying to predict the economy; however, our confidence in our ability to see year-over-year sales growth in the near future is buoyed by these trends.  

During 2009, we attempted to balance long-term opportunities for growth with the necessary short-term reactions to the current reality. In this regard, we previously slowed our store openings for 2009 to a range of 2% to 5% new stores and we stopped adding any headcount except for store openings and for stores that are growing. Over the last several years, our pathway to profit initiative has slowly altered our cost structure in that a greater portion is now variable versus fixed. This continues to help us today as we navigate through the current economic environment. As discussed in our third quarter report, we began to stabilize our store total headcount in that quarter and in October 2009 we began the steps to increase our rate of store openings. Assuming our confidence continues to be supported by an economy that is stable, we plan to continue increasing the rate of store openings, as we did in the fourth quarter of 2009, with the goal of resuming our historical rate of openings of 7% to 10% in the second half of 2010. This plan allows us to focus on the three drivers of our business: (1) average store size, which ultimately drives our level of profitability, (2) store headcount, and (3) store, or unit, growth. The last two drive our ability to grow our sales long-term.  

Our balance sheet continues to be very strong and our operations have good cash generating characteristics. During 2009, we tried to manage it well. During 2009, we generated $306,070 (or 166.0% of net earnings) of operating cash flow; the comparable figure was $259,898 (or 92.9% of net earnings) in 2008. Our first quarter typically has stronger cash flow characteristics due to the timing of tax payments; this benefit reverses itself in the second, third, and fourth quarters as income tax payments go out in April, June, September, and December. The remaining amounts of cash flow from operating activities are largely linked to the pure dynamics of a distribution business and its strong correlation to working capital.  

As we planned, our capital expenditures for 2009 were down from 2008. This primarily related to the Indianapolis, IN distribution expansion and to our new distribution center location near Dallas, TX. Most of the expenditures for these two locations occurred in 2008 and the first half of 2009. As indicated in our 2008 annual report, we expected our capital expenditures would drop from approximately $95,000 in 2008 to $65,000 in 2009. The actual 2009 figure came in at $52,538 with the difference being driven by lower capital expenditures for computer software and equipment, real estate, and vehicles. In 2010, we expect our capital expenditures will drop to approximately $40,000. Again, this reduction is driven by a significant drop in expenditures for the aforementioned Indianapolis and Dallas facilities. This reduction will be partially offset by some added spending for computer equipment and vehicles in 2010 and some potential real estate purchases for our manufacturing and distribution operations.  

The strong free cash flow in 2009 (operating cash flow less net capital expenditures) allowed us to increase our first dividend payment (declared January 2009 and paid in March 2009) by 40% (from $.25 per share in 2008 to $.35 per share in 2009). This strong free cash flow also allowed us to increase our second dividend payment (declared July 2009 and paid in August 2009) by 37% (from $.27 per share in 2008 to $.37 per share in 2009). Given the economic environment, we are satisfied with our cash flow for 2009. As announced on January 18, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $.40 per share to be paid in February 2010; this represents a 14.3% increase over our first dividend in 2009.

Financial Overview  During 2009, 2008, and 2007, the weakness of the global industrial environment negatively impacted our business. The impact of the economy is best reflected in the growth performance of our stores opened greater than ten years (2009 group reflects stores opened in 1999 and earlier) and opened greater than five years (2009 group reflects stores opened in 2004 and earlier). These two groups of stores are more cyclical due to the increased market share they enjoy in their local markets. The stores opened greater than two years (2009 group reflects stores opened in 2007 and earlier) represent a consistent same-store view of our business. The net sales change for each of the groups was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net Sales  Net sales and percentage change in net sales were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The 2009, 2008, and 2007 percentage change in net sales reflect a weakening economy since late 2006 versus a strengthening economy from summer 2003 to late 2006 in the North American market. The decrease in 2009 related to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace. The increase in net sales in 2008 and 2007 came primarily from unit sales growth in existing stores opened more than two years, growth in our newer product lines, and new store openings.  

Stores opened in 2009 contributed approximately $15,172 (or 0.8%) to 2009 net sales. Stores opened in 2008 contributed approximately $74,945 (or 3.9%) to 2009 net sales and approximately $31,917 (or 1.4%) to 2008 net sales. The rate of growth in sales of store locations generally levels off after they have been open for five years, and, as stated earlier, the sales of older store locations typically vary more with the economy than do the sales of younger stores.  

Monthly Daily Sales Change  Our business had daily sales changes (compared to the comparable month in the preceding year) as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Note: Daily sales are defined as the sales for a period divided by the number of business days in a period.

The growth in 2007 generally represents a weakening environment which began in late 2006. The final three months of 2007 continued in the same variable fashion as the previous nine months but showed consistent improvement from the third quarter daily sales growth rate of 13.7%. Generally speaking, this improvement in late 2007 remained in the first nine months of 2008 and weakened in the October 2008 to December 2008 time frame. The slow-down in the final three months of 2008 and all of 2009 relate to the general economic weakness in the global marketplace. Note  see our discussion by customer type and about sequential trends earlier in this report.  

Impact of Fuel Prices  Rising fuel prices negatively impacted 2007 and 2008; however, we did feel some relief in the final months of 2008 and the first nine months of 2009. During the first, second, third, and fourth quarter of 2009, our total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately $1.7 million, $1.9 million, $2.1 million, and $2.0 million per month, respectively. During the first, second, third, and fourth quarter of 2008, our total vehicle fuel costs averaged approximately $2.9 million, $3.7 million, $3.7 million, and $2.4 million per month, respectively. The changes resulted from variations in fuel costs, the freight initiative discussed below, a reduction in sales volume, and the increase in the number of vehicles necessary to support sales personnel and to support additional store locations. These fuel costs include the fuel utilized in our distribution vehicles (semi-tractors, straight trucks, and sprinter trucks) which is recorded in cost of goods and the fuel utilized in our store delivery vehicles which is included in operating and administrative expenses (the split in the last several years has been approximately 50:50 between distribution and store use).  

In 2005, we introduced our new freight model as a means to continue to improve our operating performance. The freight model represents a focused effort to haul a higher percentage of our products utilizing the Fastenal trucking network (which operates at a substantial savings to external service providers because of our ability to leverage our existing routes) and to charge freight more consistently in our various operating units. This initiative positively impacted our business over the last several years despite the increases in average per gallon fuel costs during several of those years. The following table indicates changes in average per gallon fuel costs during 2007, 2008, and 2009:

Gross Profit Margins  Gross profit as a percent of net sales was as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Gross profit margin percentage decreased from 2008 to 2009. The gross margin change was driven by different factors during 2009 versus 2008. Historically our gross margins have been driven by several factors: (1) a focused effort to challenge our sales force to increase the gross margin on business with a lower than acceptable margin, (2) a focused effort to stay ahead of inflationary increases in product cost which can provide short term inflation margin, (3) improvements in our direct sourcing operations, (4) continued focus on our freight initiative (discussed earlier), and (5) continued focus on our product availability within our network. This product availability focus centers on our master stocking hub in Indianapolis, Indiana, and our efficient ability to pull product from store-to-store. However, in 2009, the inflation margin noted in item (2) reversed from an inflation gain to a deflation loss as higher cost product purchased in 2008, which turned through our system slower than anticipated, was sold against deflationary selling prices in 2009 and the competitive marketplace caused the margin on recently purchased product to drop due to added pressure on selling prices. These two issues continued to worsen during the latter half of 2009; with August 2009 being the worst month. The gross margin in 2009 was also impacted by reductions in vendor volume allowances due to the reductions in purchase volumes with our vendors relative to the prior year and due to our decision to purposely forego potential volume rebates in an effort to continue to aggressively manage our inventory levels. We were disappointed by the 2009 decrease in gross margins; however, we believe the reasons noted above are short-term in nature and we remain confident in our ability to improve gross margins in 2010.  

Gross profit margins for 2008 increased over 2007. The improvement was driven by the five historical factors noted above.  

Operating and Administrative Expenses  Operating and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating and administrative expenses in 2009 decreased 12.6% from 2008. The decrease was primarily driven by (1) payroll and related costs, which contracted due to reduced headcount and due to decreased incentive compensation due to our sales and gross margin decline and (2) transportation costs, which contracted due to decreasing fuel costs. As the economy dramatically weakened in October 2008, we took steps to lower our operating and administrative expense growth in subsequent quarters if our sales growth continued to weaken. We were pleased with our ability to rein in expenses during the fourth quarter of 2008 and all of 2009. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased 13.2% from the fourth quarter of 2008.  

Operating and administrative expenses in 2008 grew 17.0% over 2007. While this rate of growth was greater than our sales growth of 13.5%, at that time it represented the slowest rate of growth we have achieved in recent history. The growth was primarily driven by (1) payroll and related costs, which expanded due to headcount growth and increased incentive due to our gross margin improvement; (2) transportation costs, which expanded due to rising fuel costs; and (3) our legal settlement described earlier in this Form 10-K. As indicated above, the economy dramatically weakened in October 2008; therefore, we took steps to lower our operating and administrative expense growth. We were pleased with our ability to rein in expenses during the fourth quarter of 2008 given the increase in personnel and store locations compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2008 grew 11.0% over the fourth quarter of 2007.

The operating and administrative expenses for 2009 include $3,850 of compensation expense related to stock options. During 2008 and 2007, this expense was $3,247 and $1,915, respectively. The increase from 2008 to 2009 was driven by stock option grants in April 2009 and 2008. The options issued in 2007, 2008, and 2009 vest over a five to eight year period. We estimate the three option grants, when combined, will result in compensation expense of approximately $330 per month for the next four years, dropping slightly in the remaining period. No other stock options were outstanding during these periods.  

Payroll & Related Costs  Payroll and related costs represented approximately 63%, 65%, and 67% of operating and administrative expenses in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Our net payroll cost for 2009 decreased approximately 18.3% from 2008. The disparity between the 10.8% full-time equivalent headcount decline (noted below) from 2008 to 2009 and the 18.3% expense decline is driven by several factors: (1) contractions in sales commissions earned, (2) contractions in bonuses earned, (3) reductions of hours worked per employee and of temporary labor, and (4) a reduction of the profit sharing contribution earned. The decrease was partially offset by the increase in stock option expense noted above and the increase in health care costs noted below. As we have indicated in the past, our regional leaders, district managers, store managers, and other sales personnel are rewarded for, among other things, growth in sales, gross profit dollars, and pre-tax earnings. The negative growth rates of these amounts during the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2009, when compared to the growth rates in the same periods of 2008, drove the contractions noted in (1), (2), and (4) above. Our net payroll costs for the fourth quarter of 2009 decreased approximately 21.1% over the fourth quarter of 2008.  

Our net payroll cost for 2008 increased approximately 14.1% over 2007. Our net payroll costs for the fourth quarter of 2008 increased approximately 7.2% over the fourth quarter of 2007. The disparity between the 9.2% full-time equivalent headcount growth in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the 7.2% expense growth is driven by contractions in the incentive commissions and bonuses earned during the final quarter of 2008.  

In 2009, payroll and related costs decreased at a rate faster than net sales due to a decrease in our gross margin percentage from 2008 to 2009 (see earlier discussion). In 2008, payroll and related costs grew faster than net sales due to increased incentive plan payouts resulting primarily from increased gross profit dollars for the year. In 2007, payroll and related costs increased at a rate which was less than the rate of increase in net sales. Effective management of this expense allows us to leverage the sales growth more effectively.  

The following sets forth the average number of employees (numbers are presented on a full-time equivalent basis) for each of 2009, 2008, and 2007:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Table of Contents 

The rate of decrease in store personnel in 2009 was slower than the rate of change in sales due to (1) a 3.0% increase in the number of store locations, and (2) our attempt to balance selling activities versus cost controls. The rate of increase in store personnel in 2008 was faster than the sales growth rate due to the additional personnel added as part of our pathway to profit initiative discussed below. The decrease in distribution and manufacturing and administrative and sales support personnel from the beginning of 2007 to the end of 2009 was amplified by the weak selling environment in 2009, but generally related to the tight management of headcount growth for these personnel since early 2007 when we first introduced our pathway to profit initiative discussed elsewhere in this report. The two-year percentage change noted above was included to emphasize the impact of the pathway to profit initiative on the relative changes between the different types of personnel.  

Two components of employee related costs did increase from 2008 to 2009  health care costs and stock option expense. The health care costs for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 52.4% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and 31.4% from the third quarter of 2009. For the year, health care costs increased 24.1%. The increase is due to rising health care costs and the increase in the percentage of employees opting for expanded coverage as their spouses have lost their insurance coverage at other employers due to the current economic environment. Our health benefits program is essentially a self-insured plan, and as the claim activity escalated during the year, we were caught by surprise in the final four to five months of the year due to the magnitude of the increase. With the benefit of hindsight, we underestimated three factors: (1) the impact of the shift in the mix of our participants noted above, (2) the impact of the gap between the expenses associated with providing COBRA benefits versus the funds received from the participants and/or the federal government, and (3) the increase in health care utilization when compared to previous years.  

We were pleased with our organizations ability to manage payroll and related costs in 2009, 2008, and 2007, while also contributing an annual profit sharing amount of approximately $5,207 and $4,743 in 2008 and 2007, respectively, to our employees 401(k) plan accounts or Registered Retirement Savings Plan accounts in the case of our Canadian employees. Unfortunately, our operating results did not allow for a profit sharing contribution in 2009.  

Occupancy Costs  Occupancy costs represented approximately 20.4%, 17.3%, and 18.4% of operating expenses in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Occupancy expenses grew approximately 3.1% from 2008 to 2009. The annual increase in occupancy was driven by a 2.5% net increase in the number of store locations, which was partially offset by reductions in rent expense at existing stores, by the relocation of approximately 4% of our stores, and by the depreciation impact of our new or expanded facilities in Dallas, Texas and Indianapolis, Indiana. Occupancy expenses grew approximately 9.9% from 2007 to 2008. In 2008, we were able to leverage our occupancy costs for the first time since earlier in the decade. Occupancy costs in 2008 and 2007 increased due to: (1) a 7.5% and 8.1% net increase in the number of store locations in 2008 and 2007, respectively, (2) the upgrade of store locations in connection with the store upgrade initiative (formerly referred to as CSP), and (3) the relocation of existing stores. During 2008 and 2007, we relocated approximately 5% and 8% of our stores, respectively.  

Transportation Costs  Transportation costs represented approximately 5.1%, 5.4%, and 5.0% of operating expenses in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Net transportation costs decreased 18.3% from 2008 to 2009. The 2009 decrease was primarily driven by lower gasoline prices and by the stabilization in the sales price of our vehicles for sale.  

In 2008, transportation was one component of operating and administrative expenses that experienced meaningful de-leverage. Our transportation costs grew approximately 26.7% from 2007 to 2008. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in fuel costs discussed earlier and by the increase in the number of vehicles needed to support an expanded sales force.  

Gain (Loss) on Sale of Property, Plant, and Equipment  The loss on sale of property and equipment for 2009 and 2008 came primarily from the sale of used vehicles. The 2008 number was partially offset by the gain on the sale of our Dallas, Texas distribution center.  

Income taxes  Incomes taxes as a percentage of earnings before income taxes, were approximately 38.0%, 38.0%, and 38.4% for 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. This rate fluctuates over time based on (1) the income tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, (2) the level of profits in those jurisdictions, and (3) changes in tax law and regulations in those jurisdictions.

Net Earnings  Net earnings, net earnings per share (EPS), percentage change in net earnings, and the percentage change in EPS, were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During 2009, the net earnings decrease was greater than that of sales primarily due to the previously mentioned factors in our gross margin discussion. During 2008, the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned improvements in gross profit margins and disciplined management of our occupancy expenses. During 2007, the net earnings growth rate was greater than that of net sales primarily because of the previously mentioned impact of payroll and related costs and the improvements in gross profit margins. The EPS percentage change rate was better than that of net earnings due to the repurchase of shares in 2007, 2008, and 2009.  

Working Capital  Two components of working capital, accounts receivable and inventories, are highlighted below. The annual dollar change and the annual percentage change were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

These two assets were impacted by our initiatives to improve working capital. These initiatives include (1) the establishment of a centralized call center to facilitate accounts receivable management (this facility became operational early in 2005) and (2) the tight management of all inventory amounts not identified as either expected store inventory, new expanded inventory, inventory necessary for upcoming store openings, or inventory necessary for our master stocking hubs.  

The accounts receivable decrease of 12.6% from December 2008 to December 2009 was the result of a daily sales decrease of 12.0% and 8.6% in November and December 2009, respectively. The accounts receivable increase of 3.6% from December 31, 2007 to December 31, 2008 relates to a daily sales increase of 6.8% and 0.0% in November and December 2008, respectively. A portion of our inventory procurement has a longer lead time than our ability to foresee sales trends; therefore, the drop in sales growth activity late in the fourth quarter of 2008 and during the first quarter of 2009 continued to result in inventory consumption that was less than the amount of inbound product, with the exception of March 2009. The inventory decrease noted in March 2009 continued through most of 2009. Our inventory dropped approximately $9,000, $36,000, and $21,000 during the first, second, and third quarters of 2009, respectively. The inventory grew by approximately $10,000 in the fourth quarter; approximately half of this increase related to our December 2009 acquisition of Holo-Krome (discussed later) and the balance related to an increase in inventory stocking at our distribution centers to support the improving sales trends we have seen since August 2009.

Table of Contents 

As we indicated in earlier communications, our goal is to move the ratio of annual sales to accounts receivable and inventory (Annual Sales: AR&I) back to a better than a 3.0:1 ratio. On December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a ratio of 2.7:1 and 2.9:1, respectively.  

Pathway to Profit  During April 2007, we disclosed our intention to alter the growth drivers of our business. For most of the last decade, we used store openings as the primary growth driver of our business (our historical rate was approximately 14% new stores each year). As announced in April 2007, we began to add outside sales personnel into existing stores at a faster rate than historical patterns. We funded this sales force expansion with the occupancy savings generated by opening stores at the rate of 7% to 10% per year (we opened approximately 3.0%, 7.5% and 8.1% new stores in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively; see also our disclosure above regarding the expected rate of 2010 store openings). At the time it was announced our goal with this strategy was four-fold: (1) to continue growing our business at a similar rate with the new outside sales investment model, (2) to grow the sales of our average store to $125 thousand per month in the five year period from 2007 to 2012, (3) to enhance the profitability of the overall business by capturing the natural expense leverage that has historically occurred in our existing stores as their sales grow, and (4) to improve the performance of our business due to the more efficient use of working capital (primarily inventory) as our average store size increases. The economic weakness that dramatically worsened in the fall of 2008 and continued into 2009 caused us to alter the pathway to profit during 2009. These changes center on two aspects (1) temporarily slowing store openings to a range of 2% to 5% (see earlier comments), and (2) stopping headcount additions except for store openings and for stores that are growing (see earlier comments). We believe this economic setback will impact the timing of when we achieve the $125 thousand per month average by 24 to 30 months. However, the current economic weakness only serves to strengthen our belief in the pathway to profit.  

Since first implementing the pathway to profit, we have increased our store count and our store full-time equivalent (FTE) head count. However, the rate of increase in store locations has slowed and FTE headcount for all types of personnel has been reduced since the economy weakened late in 2008. The percentage change (year-over-year) since the fourth quarter of 2008 in the number of stores at quarter end and in the average FTE per quarter were as follows:

While we have reduced our FTE headcount at our store locations, much of this relates to a reduction in part-time hours worked as our absolute headcount numbers related to store personnel have remained more stable. We believe this allows us to manage our expense in the short-term while maintaining our ability to sell into the marketplace. The percentage change (year-over-year) since the fourth quarter of 2008 in the absolute store personnel headcount at quarter end were as follows:

Store Size and Profitability  The store groups listed in the table below, when combined with our strategic account stores, represented approximately 87% to 89% of our sales in the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007. Strategic account stores, which numbered 27, 20, and 14 in the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, are stores that are focused on selling to a group of strategic account customers in a limited geographic market. Our remaining sales (approximately 11% to 13% in the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007) relate to either: (1) our in-plant locations, (2) our direct Fastenal Cold Heading business (including our new Holo-Krome business discussed under Acquisition below), or (3) our direct import business. Our average store, excluding the business not sold through a store, had sales of $58,100, $70,200, and $72,500 per month in the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The average age, number of stores, and pre-tax margin data by store size for the fourth quarter of 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, were as follows:

As we indicated earlier in this report, our goal is to increase the sales of our average store to approximately $125,000 per month. This will shift the store mix emphasis from the first three categories ($0 to $30,000, $30,001 to $60,000, and $60,001 to $100,000) to the last three categories ($60,001 to $100,000, $100,001 to $150,000, and over $150,000), and we believe will allow us to leverage our fixed cost and increase our overall productivity.  

Note  Dollar amounts in this section are presented in whole dollars, not thousands.  

Acquisition  On December 18, 2009, we purchased certain assets of a domestic manufacturer of socket products (a type of fastener). The business has an established name, Holo-Krome, and has a good depth of knowledge and skill in its approximate 90 employees. We believe this business will be a good addition to serving the needs of our customers. The business did not have a meaningful impact on our 2009 financial results (there were some balance sheet impacts of the all cash acquisition, as noted in our cash flow statement). The acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on our overall sales in 2010.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Net cash provided by operating activities  Net cash provided by operating activities in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The 2009, 2008, and 2007 increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the continued improvement in accounts receivable and inventory noted in the working capital discussion above.  

The percentage mix of inventory stocked at our stores versus our distribution center locations was as follows on December 31: 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

New stores open with the standard store model, which consists of a core stocking level of approximately $62 thousand per location. This inventory level grows as the level of business in a store grows.

Property and equipment expenditures in dollars and as a percentage of net earnings were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The 2009 decrease in investing activities from 2008 is primarily due to the decrease in property and equipment expenditures. This was primarily due to the reduction or elimination in 2009 of the cost related to the purchase of adjoining property in Indianapolis, Indiana and the relocation of our Dallas, Texas distribution center which occurred in 2008, and the expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center which occurred in 2008 and the first half of 2009. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in purchase of short-term marketable securities in 2009.  

The 2008 increase in investing activities is primarily due to the increase in property and equipment expenditures. This was primarily due to the expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center, the purchase of adjoining property in Indianapolis, Indiana and the relocation of our Dallas, Texas distribution center noted above.  

Property and equipment expenditures in 2009, 2008 and 2007 consist of: (1) the purchase of software and hardware for Fastenals information processing systems, (2) the addition of certain pickup trucks, (3) the purchase of signage, shelving, and other fixed assets related to store openings, (4) the addition of manufacturing and warehouse equipment, (5) the expansion or improvement of certain owned or leased store properties, (6) the expansion of Fastenals distribution/trucking fleet, (7) the cost related to the relocation of our new Dallas, Texas distribution center (2007 and 2008), (8) the cost related to the expansion of our Indianapolis, Indiana master distribution center (2008 and 2009), and (9) the cost of a new manufacturing facility in Rockford, Illinois (2008). Disposals of property and equipment consist of the planned disposition of certain pick-up trucks, semi-tractors, and trailers in the normal course of business, the disposition of real estate relating to several store locations and, in the case of 2008, the disposal of our former Dallas, Texas distribution center.  

We expect to incur approximately $40,000 in total capital expenditures in 2010, consisting of approximately $11,000 for manufacturing, warehouse and packaging equipment and facilities, $5,000 for shelving and related supplies for our store openings and a la carte store expansions, $11,000 for data processing equipment, $10,000 for real estate and improvement to store buildings, and $3,000 for vehicles. We have expanded the number of owned store locations over the last several years and expect to purchase additional locations in the future. As of December 31, 2009, we had no material outstanding commitments for capital expenditures.  

We anticipate funding our current expansion plans with cash generated from operations, from available cash and cash equivalents, and, if necessary, from our borrowing capacity. In addition to opening new stores in the United States, we plan to continue opening additional stores in our foreign markets.

The fluctuations are due to our changes in dividends and stock purchases over the three years. These items in dollars and as a percentage of earnings were as follows:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Stock Repurchase On July 10, 2009, we issued a press release announcing our board of directors had authorized purchases by us of up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock. This authorization replaced any unused authorization previously granted by the board of directors. During 2009, we purchased 1,100,000 shares of our outstanding stock at an average price of approximately $37.37 per share. These purchases occurred in the fourth quarter of 2009. With the new authorization in 2009, we have remaining authority to purchase up to 900,000 additional shares of our common stock.  

Dividends  We declared a semi-annual dividend of $.40 per share on January 18, 2010. We paid aggregate annual dividends per share of $.72, $.79, and $.44 in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.  

Line of Credit  We have an $8,000 line of credit under which $0 was outstanding at December 31, 2009. The line bears interest at 0.9% over the LIBOR rate. We do not pay a fee for the unused portion of this line.  

Effects of Inflation Price deflation related to certain products negatively impacted net sales in 2009. Price inflation related to certain products positively impacted net sales in 2008 and 2007.  

Critical Accounting Policies Our estimates related to certain assets and liabilities are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements. These estimates are considered critical because they require subjective and complex judgments.

Allowance for doubtful accounts  This reserve is for accounts receivable balances that are potentially uncollectible. The reserve is based on an analysis of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write-offs. The analysis includes the aging of accounts receivable, the financial condition of a customer or industry, and general economic conditions. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results or if economic conditions worsen for our customers.  

Inventory reserve  This reserve is for potentially obsolete inventory and shrinkage. The reserve is based on an analysis of inventory trends. The analysis includes inventory levels, sales information, physical inventory counts, cycle count adjustments, and the on-hand quantities relative to the sales history for the product. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.  

Health insurance reserve  This reserve is for incurred but not reported and reported and unpaid health claims. The reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical claim reporting trends. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.  

General insurance reserve  This reserve is for general claims related to workers compensation, property and casualty losses, and other self-insured losses. The reserve is based on an analysis of external data related to our historical general claim trends. Historically, results have reflected the reserves previously recorded. We believe the results could be materially different if historical trends do not reflect actual results.  

Tax Strategies  Our effective tax rate is based on income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions if challenged may or may not result in us prevailing. These reserves are established and adjusted in accordance with the principles of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under this guidance, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. We regularly monitor our tax positions and ASC 740 tax liabilities. We re-evaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or reverse a previously recorded tax benefit, when (i) there is a completion of a tax audit, (ii) there is a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iii) there is an expiration of the statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future periods.  

Legal Reserves  Occasionally we are involved in legal matters. The outcomes of these legal matters are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the claimants seek damages that could require significant expenditures. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 450-10-05 Contingencies, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible, but not known or probable, and can be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In most cases, significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of a loss to be recorded. Although we believe we have adequately provided for probably losses from litigation, the ultimate outcome of litigation could be materially difference from reserves recorded.
