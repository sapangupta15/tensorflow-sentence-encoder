Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

STRATEGIC OVERVIEW 

The Company provides customers access to a modern transportation network that connects ports, production and distribution centers to markets in the Northeast, Midwest and the rapidly growing southern states. The Company transports a diversified portfolio of products, from domestically abundant coal to new energy sources such as ethanol, from automobiles produced by traditional American manufacturers to “new domestic” factories owned by European, Japanese and Korean companies, and from life-essential chemicals to life-enriching consumer electronics. Additionally, the Company serves every major market in the eastern United States and has direct access to all Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports, as well as the Mississippi River, The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway. Furthermore, the Company has access to Pacific ports through alliances with western railroads. Overall, the Company’s transportation network encompasses approximately 21,000 route miles of track in 23 states, the District of Columbia and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. 

As the nation consumes increasingly higher quantities of imported goods, those products must be transported across the country in a way that minimizes the impact on the environment, takes traffic off an already congested highway system and minimizes fuel consumption and transportation costs. The Company’s transportation network, located in the largest and fastest-growing population centers in the nation, is well-positioned to capitalize on consumption growth trends. In this regard, more than two-thirds of Americans live within the Company’s service territory, accounting for about three-quarters of the nation’s consumption. 

The Company has made substantial strides in operating performance in order to capitalize on these consumption growth trends. In 2004, the Company implemented the ONE Plan, which continues to focus on optimizing the train network and utilizing rail assets more efficiently. Anchored by the ONE Plan and a variety of other initiatives implemented after the ONE Plan was introduced, the Company has achieved significant operational improvements that have enhanced safety, service reliability and productivity. These strong results include the highest customer satisfaction scores ever achieved by the Company as measured by independent surveys of its customers. 

In addition to the ONE Plan, the Company recently embarked on a new initiative called Total Service Integration (“TSI”), which aims to better align the Company’s capabilities with customer demands. TSI aims to optimize train size and increase asset utilization while delivering more reliable service to customers.

These initiatives delivered strong results for shareholders while higher levels of customer service have led to improved pricing. These efforts combined with operational efficiencies have resulted in substantial improvements in CSX’s operating income and operating ratio. 

In addition to driving better financial results to create value for shareholders, CSX also employs a balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of shareholders. This approach includes investments in the future, share repurchases and dividends. Through this balanced use of financial resources, CSX will continue to capitalize on an economic environment that is increasingly favoring rail transportation. 

2007 CSX Highlights 

Surface Transportation 

      ·   Revenue grew $464 million or 5% to over $10 billion.     

      ·   Expenses increased $339 million or 5% to $7.8 billion, which included $141 million of higher prior year gains on insurance recoveries (which reduced operating expenses) and $98 million of higher fuel costs.     

      ·   Surface Transportation Operating Income, which excludes other operating income, increased $125 million to $2.3 billion.     

      ·   Service and safety measurements improved in all categories.     

Leadership, discipline and execution resulted in excellent 2007 results, which included the lowest Surface Transportation operating ratio in a decade. Revenue and revenue per unit increased 5% and 8%, respectively, from a year ago reflecting the improving value CSX provides its customers through better service. The Company was able to achieve substantial pricing gains predominantly due to CSXT service improvements and the overall cost advantages that the Company’s rail-based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation. 

The strong results in revenue were achieved despite volume declines in all of the Company’s four major lines of business. The overall 3% volume decrease versus last year was primarily driven by continued weakness in the merchandise market relating to housing construction and associated markets, as well as lower automotive production. 

Expenses were higher due to the effects of rising fuel prices and higher prior year gains on insurance recoveries, which were recorded as a reduction to operating expenses. Lower 2007 volume and better productivity from improved operations partially offset the effects of inflation for certain expense categories.

For additional information, refer to Rail and Intermodal Results of Operations discussed on pages 40 through 43. 

The Company’s continued focus on safety and operating plan execution helped all service measurements improve compared to last year. Within the service measures, CSX achieved record performance on both of its key safety measures (FRA Personal Injuries Frequency Index and FRA Train Accident Rate) in 2007 despite some costly train accidents. Improved safety is the result of the safety leadership and train accident prevention processes. Both of these use training, awareness, compliance measurement and root cause analysis to prevent incidents and create a safer work environment. 

In addition, CSX continues to improve its train operations with gains of 4% and 12% in On-Time Train Originations and On-Time Destination Arrivals, respectively. Velocity, a measure of overall network fluidity, increased 5% in 2007. More important was the consistent week-to-week velocity, which indicates more reliable service to customers. Improved network operations also drove increased asset utilization, including an improvement of 8% in Dwell, which is the average time cars spend in terminals when being switched. The table below shows these key measurements and resources.

Other Highlights 

While operating activities generated higher cash, free cash flow, which includes dividend payments, declined $216 million to $145 million during 2007. The decline was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and dividends, along with lower insurance recoveries from claims related to Hurricane Katrina. See page 32 for further details on the changes in free cash flow during 2007. 

Surface Transportation capital expenditures, which exclude The Greenbrier, were $1.7 billion in 2007. This level of investment highlights the Company’s commitment to maintain and improve its existing infrastructure and to position itself for long-term growth through expanding network and terminal capacity. The increase compared to prior year was largely due to refinancing a portion of its locomotive capacity by replacing 150 leased units with newly owned locomotives. 

CSX also announced three significant financial events in 2007. First, CSX increased its quarterly dividend from $0.10 to $0.12 during the first quarter of 2007. It then increased the dividend again during the third quarter of 2007 to $0.15, which represented a 50% increase from the quarterly dividend level at fourth quarter 2006. Finally, CSX announced a total of $3 billion in share repurchase programs during 2007 and has completed about 70% of the repurchases. See Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies. 

Expectations 

Long-term Transportation Demand 

 Transportation demand is based on increases in population and higher consumption levels, which in turn drive the production of goods domestically and abroad that must be transported from factories and ports to the markets where they will be consumed.  

 Recent census projections estimate that today’s population of 301 million people will grow to more than 330 million by 2020. Major metropolitan areas in the southeast, where CSX has a strong presence, are projected to grow at significantly faster rates. Even in slower-growing areas over the remainder of the Company’s territory, consumption levels are projected to increase. 

 Freight tonnage – domestic and international – is expected to increase nearly 50% by 2020, according to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), placing further strain on the transportation system of America and requiring reliable solutions for shippers worldwide.

PART II 

Impact on CSX 

 The Company is well positioned to meet the nation’s growing transportation demand. For example, due to factors such as highway congestion, new regulations on hours of service and driver shortages in the trucking industry, trucking companies are beginning to partner with the Company to outsource their long-haul services and reduce their cost of shipping due to the superior cost structure of the railroads for long-haul shipments. 

 Additionally, the need for environmentally sensitive transportation solutions also favors CSX because railroads are three times more fuel efficient than highway transportation. A single train can carry the load of more than 280 trucks, reducing highway congestion and pollution while moving goods more efficiently. 

 Industry analysts predict that the pricing environment will reflect the increasing importance of railroads in serving America’s growing transportation needs and the cost of the infrastructure investments needed to maintain the safety and security of these networks and to expand them. This will drive revenue growth as volumes increase. Furthermore, while the market for transportation services remains competitive, tighter capacity and improved service levels through initiatives such as the ONE Plan and TSI are expected to sustain this favorable pricing environment, reflecting the overall value that CSX provides to its customers. 

Forecasts 

 The Company bases its performance expectations on external forecasts of economic indicators such as gross domestic product, industrial production and overall import levels. Although certain markets will remain weak, such as those that are impacted by the housing and automotive sectors, the indicators that influence CSX’s businesses are expected to be favorable in 2008. Considering these and other factors, the Company believes that its business environment remains strong and will support consistent, continuous financial improvements for the next several years. 

 Considering the Company’s solid overall business environment, along with momentum in its underlying business performance, CSX expects that its financial performance in 2008 will be consistent with its long-term financial targets, which include compounded annual growth rates (“CAGR”) as shown below:

PART II 

To reinforce its long-term vision, the Company’s Surface Transportation capital budget is expected to be nearly $5 billion between 2008 and 2010. These investments come at a time when the return on investment in the railroad industry is improving. Approximately 60% of the Company’s capital is targeted for infrastructure investment to improve network reliability and recoverability and to drive even better performance in safety. Another 20% of the Company’s capital will be invested in its locomotive and freight car fleets. The remaining 20% of CSX’s capital spending will further expand network terminal capacity, improve technology and position the Company for long-term growth. 

Free Cash Flow 

Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure under SEC Regulation G, Disclosure of Non-GAAP Measures. Management believes, however, that free cash flow is important in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and measures an ability to generate cash without incurring additional external financing. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. 

Free cash flow is calculated by using net cash from operations and adjusting for property additions, dividends and certain other investing activities such as insurance proceeds. Also, added to free cash flow is the Company’s 42% economic interest in Conrail’s free cash flow which is not consolidated in CSX amounts. Other deposits, which are included in cash provided by operating activities, are not included in the Company’s free cash flow because these deposits represent assets that were set aside for specific debt payments. 

The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure).

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Operating Income 

Operating income increased $118 million to $2.3 billion in 2007. Improvements in revenue and productivity from improved operations were partially offset by lower gains on insurance recoveries and increased fuel costs. 

Other Income 

Other income of $93 million in 2007 was relatively flat compared to the prior year. 

 Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased $25 million to $417 million in 2007 primarily due to higher average debt balances. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense increased $175 million to $706 million. This change is primarily due to higher earnings in 2007 and a prior year income tax benefit of $151 million related to the resolution of certain tax matters that were not repeated. 

Net Earnings 

Consolidated net earnings increased $26 million and totaled $1.3 billion, and earnings per diluted share increased $0.17 to $2.99. The principal elements of these increases are: 

      ·   Operating income increased $118 million driven by strong Surface Transportation results. These strong results were more than offset by $151 million of prior year income tax benefits that were not repeated. The net of these and other items decreased earnings from continuing operations by $84 million or $.08 per diluted share.     

      ·   The $110 million or $.25 per diluted share gain in discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated income statement in 2007 related to the resolution of certain tax matters associated with previously discontinued operations.

Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 

  (a)   Other operating income was $12 million and $1 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.     

Operating Revenue 

Operating revenue increased $948 million in 2006 to $9.6 billion, compared to $8.6 billion for the prior year. The primary components of the revenue gain were continued yield management and the Company’s fuel surcharge program, which drove revenue per unit across all major markets. 

Operating Income 

Operating income increased $588 million to $2.1 billion in 2006, which was driven by increased operating revenues. These revenue gains and gains on insurance proceeds from Hurricane Katrina were partially offset by increases in fuel expense caused by higher fuel prices and lower hedge benefits. 

Other Income 

Other income decreased $6 million to $95 million in 2006. This change was driven primarily by lower real estate sales, which was partially offset by an after-tax non-cash gain on additional Conrail property value received in connection with the 2004 Conrail spin-off transaction.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense decreased $31 million to $392 million in 2006 compared to the prior year. There was lower interest expense from lower average debt balances for 2006 (due to a $1.0 billion debt repurchase in mid-2005). However, this savings was partially offset by higher variable interest rates. 

Income Tax Expense 

Income tax expense increased $215 million to $531 million in 2006 as a result of higher earnings. This increase was partially offset by the net impact of favorable resolutions of certain tax matters in 2006 that were higher than benefits in 2005. 

Net Earnings 

Net earnings for 2006 increased $165 million to $1.3 billion, with earnings per share up $.30 to $2.82 per diluted share from the prior year. This increase was primarily due to the following factors: 

      ·   Driven by Surface Transportation results, earnings from continuing operations were up $590 million, or $1.23 per diluted share;     

      ·   Offsetting this increase was income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $425 million, or $.93 per diluted share, as a result of the sale of CSX’s International Terminals business in 2005.

PART II 

2007 vs. 2006 Rail Results of Operations 

Rail Operating Revenue 

Rail revenue is categorized by three main lines of business: merchandise, coal and automotive. Revenue increased $520 million, or 6%, to $8.7 billion in 2007 as compared to prior year. CSXT was able to achieve continued pricing gains predominantly due to the overall cost and service advantages that the Company’s rail based solutions provide to customers versus other modes of transportation. These pricing gains more than offset volume weakness in housing construction, domestic automobile production and related markets. 

Merchandise 

Chemicals – Revenue and revenue per unit improved due to a continued favorable pricing environment. Overall volume declined slightly driven by reduced chlorine shipments and weakness in propane demand due to a milder winter in 2007. 

Emerging Markets – Revenue and revenue per unit grew due to continued yield management efforts. Volume was down as a result of declines in aggregate shipments, such as crushed stone, sand and gravel, caused by a continued weakness in residential construction. 

Forest Products – Revenue and volume declined as shipments of building products and paper slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts and electronic media substitution. 

Agriculture Products – Strong domestic demand in feed ingredients and soybean shipments supported growth in volume and revenue. Ethanol volumes also increased as a result of expanded use in the Northeast. Revenue per unit grew as a result of continued focus on yield management. 

Metals – Revenue and revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing actions. Lower demand for steel due to weakness in housing construction and domestic automobile production resulted in volume declines. 

Phosphates and Fertilizers – Volume was flat as higher domestic demand was offset by a decrease in export shipments. Favorable mix driven by these volume changes coupled with price increases resulted in significantly improved revenue and revenue per unit. 

Food and Consumer – Revenue and volume declines were driven by decreased demand for building products, appliances and roofing granules, which are used to make shingles. 

40 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Coal 

Favorable pricing positively influenced revenue and revenue per unit. Overall tonnage was flat even though carloads slightly declined due to the use of higher capacity cars allowing the movement of more tons with fewer cars. Strength in the export market was offset by weakness in utility shipments as stockpiles remain at record high levels. 

Automotive 

Volume declined due to a reduction in light vehicle production, several plant closures, and lower vehicle sales driven by the slowing economy and tight credit environment. Consistent with the overall automotive market, volumes continued to shift to foreign brands produced domestically. 

Other Rail Revenue 

The change is primarily due to increased shipments by the Company’s regional railroads and more transloading activities associated with ethanol shipments. 

Rail Operating Expense 

Total rail operating expenses for 2007 increased $387 million to $6.7 billion compared to the prior year. The description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes is described below. 

Labor and Fringe expenses include employee compensation and benefit programs. These expenses are primarily affected by inflation, headcount, wage rates, incentives earned, healthcare plan costs, and pension and other post-retirement plan expenses. These expenses increased $57 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation, which was partially offset by improved productivity and reduced staffing levels. 

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses consist primarily of materials and contracted services to maintain infrastructure and equipment and for terminal services at intermodal and automotive facilities. This category also includes costs related to personal injury claims, environmental remediation, train accidents, utilities, non-locomotive fuel, property and sales taxes and professional services. Overall, materials, supplies and other expenses increased by $85 million in 2007 primarily due to inflation, higher train accident related costs and higher environmental costs. These costs were partially offset by $99 million of favorable personal injury reserve adjustments during the year, which were based on management’s review of the actuarial analyses performed by an independent actuarial firm. This was due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of work-related injuries for CSXT employees since 2003. 

41 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Depreciation expense primarily relates to recognizing the cost of a capital asset, such as locomotives, railcars and track structure, over its useful life. This expense is impacted primarily by the capital expenditures made each year. This expense increased $30 million primarily due to a larger asset base as a result of higher capital spending partially offset by lower depreciation rates resulting from periodic asset life studies. 

Fuel expense includes locomotive diesel fuel. This expense is driven by the market price and locomotive consumption of diesel fuel offset by the effects of any hedging activities. This expense increased $98 million primarily due to higher fuel prices and prior year hedge benefits that were not repeated during 2007 due to the expiration of the fuel hedge program. 

Equipment and Other Rents primarily includes rent paid for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies, net of rents received by CSXT for use of CSXT equipment. This category of expenses also includes lease expenses primarily for locomotives, railcars, containers and trailers, office and other rentals. These expenses decreased $36 million due mainly to lower volume and fewer locomotive leases. 

Inland Transportation expense included in the rail segment is for amounts paid to CSXT from Intermodal for shipments on CSXT’s network. These intercompany charges are eliminated in consolidated results. 

Gain on Insurance Recoveries includes gains on insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina. While gains were recognized in both years, the $139 million decrease for 2007 was due to higher cash receipts for lost profits and replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged in 2006 versus 2007. 

42 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

2007 vs. 2006 Intermodal Results of Operations 

Intermodal operating income declined 3% or $8 million versus last year on 4% lower revenue, partially offset by volume related cost savings. Revenue and volume decreases reflect losses of several International customers, the slowing of Asian imports throughout the year and mix impact related to growth in new short-haul domestic traffic. Other revenue declined $22 million from the termination of an agreement relating to the storage of containers as well as lower general business levels. Revenue per unit declined slightly with yield gains in the international market being offset by mix changes related to the new short-haul domestic traffic. 

Despite rising fuel costs, Intermodal operating expense declined $48 million or 4% driven by lower car hire expense related to volume and improved operational efficiency. Additionally, depreciation decreased based on the results of a periodic review of asset useful lives.

PART II 

2006 vs. 2005 Rail Results of Operations 

Rail Operating Revenue 

CSXT categorizes rail revenue in three main lines of business: merchandise, coal and automotive. Revenue for CSXT increased $898 million, or 12%, to $8.2 billion in 2006 from a year ago. Continued yield management and fuel surcharge were the primary drivers of revenue per unit gains. 

Merchandise 

Chemicals – Revenue and revenue per unit improved by capitalizing on a continued strong pricing environment. Overall volume was down slightly because high raw material costs continued to negatively affect the U.S. chemical industry’s competitiveness and in turn, CSXT volumes. 

Emerging Markets – Growth was driven by increased shipments of municipal waste, military, and aggregate products (which include rocks and sand). Revenue per unit also improved due to strong pricing actions. 

Forest Products – Shipment of building products and printing paper slowed due to the decline in residential housing starts and electronic media conversion. However, revenue and revenue per unit improved due to a favorable pricing environment. 

Agriculture Products – Strong domestic demand in feed grain, soybean, ethanol, and export shipments supported volume and revenue per unit. In addition, strong export demand for grain and increased shipments of beans helped volume growth. 

Metals – Revenue and revenue per unit increased due to continued pricing gains and fuel surcharge coverage. Volume increased slightly driven by strong steel demand in the energy and non-residential construction end-markets. These gains were partially offset by lower demand for steel in the automotive sector. 

Phosphates and Fertilizers – Volume declined from lower export shipments due to increased international phosphate production which caused several domestic phosphate plants to close. Favorable mix coupled with price increases resulted in significantly improved revenue per unit. 

Food and Consumer – Volume growth in alcoholic beverages, canned goods, and rice and beans was offset by softness in building products, perishables, and the appliance markets. Strong pricing actions, and a focus on longer, more profitable shipments increased revenue and revenue per unit. 

45 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Coal 

Revenue and volume improvements were due to increased shipments of utility and export coal. Utility companies built up their inventories which was a major contributor to CSX’s volume growth. Revenue per unit increased due to the continued favorable pricing environment and increased fuel surcharge coverage.  

Automotive 

Volume declined due to a reduction in North American light vehicle production. Consistent with the overall automotive market, CSXT’s volumes continued to shift from the Big 3 to foreign brands produced domestically. Revenue per unit was favorable due to price increases and fuel surcharge. 

Rail Operating Expense 

Total rail operating expenses for 2006 increased $341 million, or 6%, to $6.3 billion compared to the prior year. The description of what is included in each category as well as significant year over year changes is described below. 

Labor and Fringe increased $63 million primarily due to wage and benefit inflation and increased staffing in rail operations. 

Materials, Supplies and Other expenses increased by $113 million in 2006 primarily due to materials inflation, along with prior year casualty favorable adjustments and supplier reimbursements that were not repeated. These costs were partially offset by productivity gains from improved operations, such as efficient use of locomotives. 

Depreciation expense increased $39 million due to a larger asset base related to higher capital spending. 

Fuel expense increased $329 million primarily due to reduced hedge benefit from the expiration of the fuel hedge program as well as higher fuel prices. 

Equipment and Other Rents expense decreased $18 million due mainly to improvement in operational fluidity, which drove improvements in asset utilization. 

Gain on Insurance Recoveries was $166 million for 2006, which represented cash received for lost profits and higher replacement value of property compared to the value of the property that was damaged, after consideration of the Company’s insurance deductible expensed in 2005.

2006 vs. 2005 Intermodal Results of Operations 

Intermodal operating income increased 8% or $20 million versus last year driven by revenue gains of $50 million along with expense containment. The increase in revenue and revenue per unit was driven by the continued yield management emphasis which was partially offset by mix of traffic. Volume increased slightly due to continued growth of imported consumer goods from Asia as well as the strength in the truckload market offset by weaker demand in services sold to transportation brokers (known as wholesale markets). 

Intermodal operating expense increased $30 million primarily driven by an increase in fuel costs that are reflected in inland transportation expense. Fuel costs were higher due to rising market prices. Partially offsetting the increase in fuel were efficiency gains related to equipment utilization.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity is a company’s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs for obligations as they mature and to provide for planned operational growth. In order to have a complete picture of a company’s liquidity, its balance sheet, sources and uses of cash flow and external factors should be reviewed. 

Material Changes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets 

CSX’s balance sheet reflects its strong capital base and the impact of CSX’s balanced approach in deploying its capital for the benefit of its shareholders, which includes reinvestment in the Company’s existing infrastructure, investments in the future, share repurchases and dividends. 

Long-term debt increased $1.1 billion to $6.5 billion due to debt issuances in 2007 of $2.4 billion partially offset by the conversion of a portion of convertible debt into CSX common stock and the reclassification of debt from long-term to current. See the Schedule of Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments on page 50 and Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements, for additional details. 

Other capital decreased $1.4 billion to $37 million as a result of significant share repurchase activity partially offset by stock option exercises and the conversion of a portion of convertible debt into CSX common stock. For additional information on the Company’s share repurchase activity, see Note 1, Nature of Operations and Significant Accounting Policies. 

Sources and Uses of Cash 

CSX has multiple sources of cash. First, the Company generates cash from operations. In 2007, CSX generated $2.2 billion of cash from operating activities, which represented a $126 million increase from the prior year. Second, CSX has numerous financing sources including access to the capital markets and a $1.25 billion five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in May 2012. This facility can be increased by an additional $500 million to $1.75 billion with the approval of the lending banks. See Note 9, Debt and Credit Agreements for more information. 

CSX also has an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC that is unlimited as to amount and may be used, subject to market conditions and CSX Board authorization, to issue debt or equity securities at CSX’s discretion. While CSX seeks to give itself flexibility with respect to cash requirements, there can be no assurance that market conditions would permit CSX to sell such debt securities on acceptable terms at any given time, or at all.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Among other things, CSX uses cash for significant annual reinvestment in infrastructure and equipment, share repurchases and scheduled payments of debt and leases with manageable near-term maturities. The Company’s cash requirements also include dividends to shareholders. 

During 2007, net cash used by investing activities was $1.7 billion. This use of funds was predominately driven by property additions and capital expansion projects made by the Company. Net cash used in financing activities was $584 million due to over $2 billion of cash used for share repurchases during 2007, largely offset by a net increase in long-term debt issued versus long-term debt repaid. 

Dividend payments are another use of cash. The Company paid dividends of $231 million in 2007, which was $86 million more than prior year. The increase in 2007 was primarily due to the Company increasing quarterly dividends to $0.15 per share. 

Working Capital 

Working capital can be considered a measure of a company’s ability to meet its short-term needs. CSX had a working capital deficit at December 2007 of $180 million compared to a surplus of $150 million last year driven by lower cash and higher current debt balances in 2007. The larger current debt balance includes a reclassification of outstanding convertible debt with a face value of $174 million from long-term to current during 2007. This reflects bondholders’ rights under the convertible debt to require CSX to purchase the debentures in October 2008 in lieu of the later maturity date. 

A working capital deficit is not unusual for CSX or other companies in the industry and does not indicate a lack of liquidity. The Company continues to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due. CSX has sufficient financial capacity, including the revolving line of credit and shelf registration, to manage its day-to-day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations. 

Credit Ratings 

Credit ratings reflect an independent agency’s judgment on the likelihood that a borrower will repay a debt obligation at maturity. The ratings reflect many considerations, such as the nature of the borrower’s industry and its competitive position, the size of the company, its liquidity and access to capital and the sensitivity of a company’s cash flows to changes in the economy. The two largest rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”), use alphanumeric codes to designate their ratings. The highest quality rating for long-term credit obligations is AAA+ and Aaa1 for S&P and Moody’s, respectively. 

49 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Long-term ratings of BBB- and Baa3 or better by S&P and Moody’s, respectively, reflect ratings on debt obligations that fall within a band of credit quality considered to be “investment grade.” Currently, the long-term ratings for CSX’s obligations, along with the other large U.S. Class 1 freight railroads, fall within the investment grade band of credit quality. 

In 2007, S&P and Moody’s both lowered their ratings of CSX's long-term unsecured debt obligations from BBB and Baa2, respectively, to BBB- and Baa3, respectively. This was due to the Company’s announcement in second quarter 2007 of a plan to repurchase an additional $1 billion of CSX stock in addition to the $2 billion repurchase plan announced earlier in 2007. Both of these agencies indicate their outlook is “Stable” and these ratings continue to be investment grade. CSX maintained these credit ratings through December 2007 and does not expect that this reduction in credit ratings will materially increase its borrowing costs or materially affect its liquidity. If CSX's credit ratings were to decline to lower levels, the Company could experience more significant increases in its interest cost for new debt. In addition, the market’s demand, and thus the Company’s ability to readily issue new debt, could become further influenced by the economic and credit market environment.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

 For detailed information about the Company’s guarantees, operating leases and purchase obligations, see Note 7, Commitments and Contingencies. 

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that management make estimates in reporting the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are discussed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Consistent with the prior year, significant estimates using management judgment are made for the following areas: 

      ·   casualty, environmental and legal reserves;     

      ·   pension and post-retirement medical plan accounting;     

      ·   depreciation policies for assets under the group-life method; and     

      ·   income taxes       

Casualty, Environmental and Legal Reserves 

Casualty 

Casualty reserves represent accruals for personal injury and occupational injury claims. Currently, no individual claim is expected to exceed the Company’s self-insured retention amount. To the extent the value of an individual claim exceeds the self-insured retention amount, CSX would present the liability on a gross basis with a corresponding receivable for insurance recoveries. Personal injury and occupational claims are presented on a gross basis and in accordance with SFAS 5, Accounting for Contingencies (“SFAS 5”). These reserves fluctuate with estimates provided by independent third parties reviewed by management, and are offset by the timing of payments. Most of the claims were related to CSXT unless otherwise noted. 

51 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Defense and processing costs, which historically have been insignificant and are anticipated to be insignificant in the future, are not included in the recorded liabilities. The Company is presently self-insured for personal injury and occupational-related claims. 

Personal Injury 

Personal injury reserves represent liabilities for employee work-related and third-party injuries. Work-related injuries for CSXT employees are primarily subject to the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (“FELA”). In addition to FELA liabilities, employees of other CSX subsidiaries are covered by various state workers’ compensation laws, the Federal Longshore and Harbor Worker’s Compensation Program or the Maritime Jones Act. 

CSXT retains an independent actuarial firm to assist management in assessing the value of personal injury claims and cases. An analysis is performed by the independent actuarial firm semi-annually and is reviewed by management. The methodology used by the actuary includes a development factor to reflect growth or reduction in the value of these personal injury claims. It is based largely on CSXT’s historical claims and settlement experience. Actual results may vary from estimates due to the type and severity of the injury, costs of medical treatments and uncertainties in litigation. 

Based on management’s review of the actuarial analyses performed by an independent actuarial firm, the Company reduced personal injury reserves by $99 million during 2007. This reduction is due to a trend of significant decreases in the number and severity of work-related injuries for CSXT employees since 2003. The analyses further indicated an absence of large catastrophic claims since 2003, which also was determined to be a trend. These reductions were included in materials, supplies and other in the consolidated income statements. 

Occupational 

Occupational claims arise from allegations of exposures to certain materials in the workplace, such as asbestos, solvents (which include soaps and chemicals) and diesel fuels or allegations of chronic physical injuries resulting from work conditions, such as repetitive stress injuries, carpal tunnel syndrome and hearing loss. 

Asbestos 

The Company is party to a number of occupational claims by employees alleging exposure to asbestos in the workplace. The heaviest possible exposure for employees was due to work conducted in and around steam locomotive engines that were largely phased out beginning around the 1950s. However, other types of exposures, including exposure from locomotive component parts and building materials, continued until it was substantially eliminated by 1985. Additionally, the Company has retained liability for asbestos claims filed against the previously owned international container shipping business.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

The Company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing asbestos and other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the Company’s claims and cases. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi-annually and is reviewed by management. The objective of the analysis is to determine the number of estimated incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims and the estimated average cost per claim to be received over the next seven years. Seven years was determined by management to be the time period in which probable claim filings and claim values could be estimated with more certainty. 

The Company, with the assistance of the third party specialist, determines its potentially exposed population and it is then able to derive the estimated number of IBNR claims. The estimated average cost per claim is then determined utilizing recent actual average cost per claim data and national industry data. Key elements of the assessment include the following: 

      ·   An estimate is computed using a ratio of Company employee data to national employment for select years during the period 1938-2001. The Company uses railroad industry historical census data because it does not have detailed employment records in order to compute the population of potentially exposed employees.     

      ·   The projected incidence of disease is estimated based on epidemiological studies using employees’ age and the duration and intensity of potential exposure while employed. Epidemiology is the medical science that deals with the incidence, distribution and control of diseases in a population.     

      ·   An estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of disease (non-malignant, cancer and mesothelioma) is computed using the Company’s average historical claim filing rates for a three-year calibration period, excluding a surge in claims originating in West Virginia. In 2006, the Company received 852 asbestos claims in West Virginia in which the claimants were neither exposed in West Virginia nor residents of the state. CSX believes these claims will not have merit as no medical evidence has been provided to substantiate the claims and therefore CSX has excluded them from the calibration period. Claim levels in 2007 returned to expected levels and management feels this calibration period represents the best estimate of future filing rates.     

      ·   An estimate of the future anticipated dismissal rate by type of claim is computed using the Company’s historical average dismissal rates observed during the current calibration period noted above.     

53 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

      ·   An estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of disease is computed using the Company’s historical average of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of incident observed during the current calibration period noted above.     

From these assumptions, the Company projects the incidence of each type of disease to the estimated population to determine the total estimated number of employees that could potentially assert a claim. Historical claim filing rates are applied for each type of disease to the total number of employees that could potentially assert a claim to determine the total number of anticipated claim filings by disease type. Historical dismissal rates, which represented claims that were closed without payment, were deducted to calculate the number of future claims by disease type that would likely require payment by the Company. Finally, the number of such claims was multiplied by the average settlement value to estimate the Company’s future liability for IBNR asbestos claims. 

The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would result in an approximate $1 million increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted asbestos claims. 

Other Occupational 

The Company retains a third party specialist with extensive experience in performing other occupational studies to assist management in assessing the value of the Company’s claims and cases. The analysis is performed by the specialist semi-annually and is reviewed by management. Similar to the asbestos liability estimation process, the key elements of the assessment include the following: 

      ·   An estimate of the potentially exposed population for other occupational diseases is calculated by projecting active versus retired workforce from 2002 to 2010 using a growth rate projection for overall railroad employment made by the Railroad Retirement Board in its June 2003 report.     

      ·   An estimate of the future anticipated claims filing rate by type of injury, employee type, and active versus retired employee is computed using the Company’s average historical claim filing rates for the calibration periods management felt were representative of future filing rates. For carpal tunnel and repetitive stress injuries, the current calibration period is a 1-year average of claim filings. Hearing loss uses a 3-year calibration period, and all other diseases or injuries use a 2-year calibration period. An estimate is made to forecast future claims by using the filing rates by disease and the active and retired CSX population each year.

      ·   An estimate of the future anticipated settlement by type of injury is computed using the Company’s historical average of dollars paid per claim for pending and future claims using the average settlement by type of injury observed during a period that management feels is representative of future settlement amounts.     

The estimated future filing rates and estimated average claim values are the most sensitive assumptions for this reserve. A 1% increase or decrease in either the forecasted number of IBNR claims or the average claim values would not result in a material increase or decrease in the liability recorded for unasserted other occupational claims. 

Environmental 

The Company is a party to various proceedings related to environmental issues, including administrative and judicial proceedings, involving private parties and regulatory agencies. The Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) at approximately 247 environmentally impaired sites, many of which were, or may be, subject to remedial action under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, or similar state statutes. Most of these proceedings arose from environmental conditions on properties used for ongoing or discontinued railroad operations. However, a number of these proceedings are based on allegations that the Company, or its predecessors, sent hazardous substances to facilities owned or operated by others for treatment or disposal. In addition, some of the Company’s land holdings were leased to others for commercial or industrial uses that may have resulted in releases of hazardous substances or other regulated materials onto the property and could give rise to proceedings against the Company. 

In any such proceedings, the Company is subject to environmental clean-up and enforcement actions under the Superfund Law, as well as similar state laws that may impose joint and several liability for clean-up and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. These costs could be substantial. 

In accordance with Statement of Position 96-1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities, the Company reviews its role with respect to each site identified at least once a quarter, giving consideration to a number of factors such as: 

      ·   type of clean-up required;     

      ·   nature of the Company’s alleged connection to the location (e.g. generator of waste sent to the site or owner or operator of the site);     

55 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

      ·   extent of the Company’s alleged connection (e.g. volume of waste sent to the location and other relevant factors); and     

      ·   number, connection and financial viability of other named and unnamed PRPs at the location.     

Based on the review process, the Company has recorded amounts to cover contingent future environmental remediation costs with respect to each site to the extent such costs are estimable and probable. The recorded liabilities for estimated future environmental costs are undiscounted and include amounts representing the Company's estimate of unasserted claims, which the Company believes to be immaterial. The liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites as well as any significant ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated insurance recoveries. 

Currently, the Company does not possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of additional liabilities, if any, on some sites until completion of future environmental studies. In addition, conditions that are currently unknown could, at any given location, result in exposure, the amount and materiality of which cannot presently be reliably estimated. Based upon information currently available, however, the Company believes its environmental reserves are adequate to fund remedial actions to comply with present laws and regulations, and that the ultimate liability for these matters, if any, will not materially affect its overall results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

Legal 

In accordance with SFAS 5, an accrual for a loss contingency is established if information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of these conditions are not met, or if an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued, disclosure of the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred. 

The Company evaluates all exposures relating to legal liabilities at least quarterly and adjusts reserves when appropriate under the guidance noted above. The amount of a particular reserve may be influenced by factors that include official rulings, newly discovered or developed evidence, or changes in laws, regulations, and evidentiary standards.

PART II 

Pension and Post-retirement Medical Plan Accounting 

The Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans principally for salaried, management personnel. The plans provide eligible employees with retirement benefits based predominantly on years of service and compensation rates near retirement. For employees hired after December 31, 2002, benefits are determined based on a cash balance formula, which provides benefits by utilizing interest and pay credits based upon age, service and compensation. CSX made pension plan contributions of $266 million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2007. 

In addition to these plans, CSX sponsors a post-retirement medical plan and one life insurance plan that provide benefits to full-time, salaried, management employees hired prior to January 1, 2003, upon their retirement if certain eligibility requirements are met. The post-retirement medical plan is contributory (partially funded by retirees), with retiree contributions adjusted annually. The life insurance plan is non-contributory. 

The accounting for these plans is subject to the guidance provided in SFAS 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132 (R) (“SFAS 158”), SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (“SFAS 87”), and SFAS 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension (“SFAS 106”). 

SFAS 87 requires that management make certain assumptions relating to the following:  

      ·   long-term rate of return on plan assets;     

      ·   discount rates used to measure future obligations and interest expense;     

      ·   salary scale inflation rates;     

      ·   health care cost trend rates; and     

      ·   other assumptions.     

These assumptions are determined as of the beginning of the year. As permitted by SFAS 87, the Company has elected to use a plan measurement date of September 30 to actuarially value its pension and post-retirement plans. As required by SFAS 158, CSX will change its measurement date to the fiscal year end in 2008 and does not expect the impact to be material. The Company engages independent, external actuaries to compute the amounts of liabilities and expenses relating to these plans subject to the assumptions that the Company selects. The Company reviews the long-term rate of return, discount, salary scale inflation and health care cost trend rates on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends as appropriate. 

57 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets 

The expected long-term average rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. In estimating that rate, the Company gives appropriate consideration to the returns being earned by the plan assets in the funds and the rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment. 

The Company's expected long-term average rate of return on assets considers the current and projected asset mix of the funds. Management balances market expectations obtained from various investment managers and economists with both market and actual plan historical returns to develop a reasonable estimate of the expected long-term rate of return on assets. As this assumption is long-term, it is adjusted less frequently than other assumptions used in pension accounting. The long-term rate of return on plan assets used by the Company to value its 2007 pension obligation was 8.5%. 

Discount Rates 

Discount rates affect the amount of liability recorded and the interest expense component of pension and post-retirement expense. Discount rates reflect the rates at which pension and other post-retirement benefits could be effectively settled, or in other words, how much it would cost the Company to buy enough high quality bonds to generate cash flow equal to the Company’s expected future benefit payments. The Company determines the discount rate based on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows matching the plans’ expected benefit payments. 

The discount rates used by the Company to value its 2007 pension and post-retirement obligations are 6% and 5.75%, respectively. The Company uses a different discount rate for pension and post-retirement benefits due to the different time horizons of future payments for each of the plans. For pensions, the time horizon is approximately 12 years, while for post-retirement, the time horizon is approximately 8 years. 

Each year these discount rates are reevaluated and adjusted to reflect the best estimate of the current effective settlement rates. If interest rates generally decline or rise, the assumed discount rates will change.  

 Salary Scale Inflation Rates 

Salary scale inflation rates are based on current trends and historical data accumulated by the Company. The Company reviews recent wage increases and management incentive compensation payments over the past five years in its assessment of salary scale inflation rates. The Company used a salary scale rate of 4.1% to value its 2007 pension obligation.

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Health Care Cost Trend Rates 

Health care cost trend rates are based on recent plan experience and industry trends. The Company uses actuarial data to substantiate the inflation assumption for health care costs, representing increases in total plan costs (which include claims and administrative fee cost components). The current assumed health care cost trend rate is 10% for Medicare-eligible participants and 9% for non-Medicare-eligible participants and is expected to decrease gradually until reaching 4.75% in 2014, based upon current actuarial projections. 

Other Assumptions 

 The calculations made by the actuaries also include assumptions relating to mortality rates, turnover and retirement age. These assumptions are based upon historical data and are approved by management. 

2007 Estimated Pension and Post-retirement Expense 

Net periodic pension and post-retirement benefits expense for 2008 is expected to be approximately $34 million and $28 million, respectively, compared to $64 million and $25 million, respectively in 2007. 

The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the effect of changes in certain assumptions like discount rates, salaries and health care costs on the 2008 estimated pension and post-retirement expense:

Depreciation Policies for Assets Under the Group-Life Method 

CSXT accounts for its rail assets, including main-line track, locomotives and freight cars, using the group-life method. The group-life method pools similar assets by type and then depreciates each group as a whole. Under the group-life method, the service lives for each group of rail assets are determined by completing periodic life studies and applying management's assumptions concerning the service lives of its properties. These life studies are conducted by a third party expert, analyzed by the Company's management and approved by the STB. Life studies for equipment assets are required every three years, whereas road and track life studies are required every six years by the STB. 

59 

Table of Contents 

CSX CORPORATION 

PART II 

Changes in asset lives due to the results of the life studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense, and thus, the Company's results of operations. Factors taken into account during the life study include: 

      ·   Statistical analysis of historical retirements for each group of property;     

      ·   Evaluation of current operations;     

      ·   Evaluation of technological advances and maintenance schedules;     

      ·   Previous assessment of the condition of the assets and outlook for their continued use;     

      ·   Expected net salvage to be received upon retirement; and     

      ·   Comparison of assets to the same asset groups with other companies.     

The life studies may also indicate that the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the appropriate amount indicated by the study. Any such deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining useful life of the asset group until the next required life study. 

In 2007, CSXT completed life studies for all of its equipment, road and track assets and also completed an analysis of the assets received in the Conrail reorganization, which resulted in a reduction in depreciation expense for equipment and road assets and an increase in depreciation expense for track assets. The combination of these adjustments reduced depreciation expense by $21 million in 2007. Also in 2007, the Company reviewed the useful lives of Intermodal terminal assets, as well as lift equipment and containers. A $4 million reduction in depreciation expense was recognized as a result of this periodic review. 

Assets depreciated under the group-life method comprise 91% of CSXT's total fixed assets of $21 billion on a net basis at December 28, 2007. The Company’s depreciation expense for the year ended December 28, 2007 amounted to $883 million. A one percent change in the average life of all group-life assets would result in an $8 million change to the Company’s annual depreciation expense.

Income Taxes 

In 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FIN 48, which became effective for CSX beginning in 2007. FIN 48 addressed the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under FIN 48, the Company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. The Company’s reassessment of its tax positions in accordance with FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

CSX files a consolidated federal income tax return, which includes its principal domestic subsidiaries. Examinations of the federal income tax returns of CSX have been completed through 2003. Federal income tax returns for 2004 through 2007 currently are under examination. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that might be assessed. While the final outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of CSX management that none of these items will have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of CSX. An unexpected adverse resolution of one or more of these items, however, could have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year. Also, the Company is party to a number of legal and administrative proceedings, the resolution of which could result in gain realization in amounts that could be material to results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year.
