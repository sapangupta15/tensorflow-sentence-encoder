Dollars in millions

INTEREST RATE RISK

We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in short-term interest rates. As of February 2, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,285, which generate interest income at variable rates, and gross credit card receivables of $2,142, which generate finance charge income at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Interest rate fluctuations can affect our interest income, credit card revenues and interest expense. See Note 3: Accounts Receivable in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information.

We use sensitivity analyses to measure and assess our interest rate risk exposure. For purposes of presenting the potential earnings effect of a reasonably possible hypothetical change in interest rates from our reporting date, we utilized two sensitivity scenarios: (i) linear growth of approximately 170 basis points over the year and (ii) linear decline of approximately 20 basis points over the year, due to the fact that current interest rates are at or near historically low levels. Other key parameters and assumptions in our sensitivity analyses include the average cash and cash equivalents balance, average credit card receivables balance and no new floating rate debt issuance. The first hypothetical scenario would result in an approximate $16 increase in future earnings, while the second hypothetical scenario would not have a material effect on future earnings.

For our long-term fixed-rate debt of $3,131, our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the change in fair value of the debt. As of February 2, 2013, the fair value of our fixed-rate debt was $3,665. See Note 8: Debt and Credit Facilities and Note 9: Fair Value Measurements in Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK

The majority of our revenues, expenses and capital expenditures are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, we periodically enter into merchandise purchase orders denominated primarily in Euros. From time to time, we may use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. As of February 2, 2013, our outstanding forward contracts did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

During 2012, we announced plans to open four full-line stores in Canada beginning in 2014, and as a result we have incurred certain expenses denominated in Canadian dollars. As of February 2, 2013, activities associated with the future store openings have not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
