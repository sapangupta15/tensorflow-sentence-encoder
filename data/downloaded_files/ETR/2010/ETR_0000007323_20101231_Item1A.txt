RISK FACTORS 

Investors should review carefully the following risk factors and the other information in this Form 10-K. The risks that Entergy faces are not limited to those in this section. There may be additional risks and uncertainties (either currently unknown or not currently believed to be material) that could adversely affect Entergy's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. See "FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION." 

Utility Regulatory Risks 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas and System Energy) 

The terms and conditions of service, including electric and gas rates, of the Utility operating companies and System Energy are determined through regulatory approval proceedings that are lengthy and subject to appeal that could result in delays in effecting rate changes and uncertainty as to ultimate results. 

The rates that the Utility operating companies and System Energy charge reflect their capital expenditures, operations and maintenance charges, allowed rates of return, financing costs, and related costs of service. These rates significantly influence the financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity of Entergy and each of the Utility operating companies and System Energy. These rates are determined in regulatory proceedings and are subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. 

In addition, regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the prudence of costs in the Utility operating companies' base rates and examine, among other things, the prudence of the companies' operation and maintenance practices, level of expenditures (including storm costs), allowed rates of return and appropriate rate base, proposed resource acquisitions and previously incurred capital expenditures. The regulators can disallow costs found not to have been prudently incurred or found not to have been incurred in compliance with applicable tariffs, creating some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulatory proceedings relating to rates and other matters typically involve multiple parties seeking to limit or reduce rates. The proceedings generally have long timelines, are prima rily based on historical costs, and may or may not be limited by statute, which could cause the Utility operating companies and System Energy to experience regulatory lag in recovering such costs through rates. Decisions are typically subject to appeal, potentially leading to additional uncertainty associated with rate case proceedings. Although four of the Utility operating companies currently obtain recovery under formula rate plans, at some point in the future these formula rate plans may no longer be extended, at which time these Utility operating companies would operate again in a more traditional rate case environment. 

The Utility operating companies and System Energy, and the energy industry as a whole, have experienced a period of rising costs and investments, which could result in more frequent rate cases and requests for, and the continuation of, cost recovery mechanisms. For information regarding rate case proceedings and formula rate plans applicable to certain of the Utility operating companies, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 

The Utility operating companies recover fuel and purchased power costs through rate mechanisms that are subject to risks of delay or disallowance in regulatory proceedings. 

The Utility operating companies recover their fuel and purchased power costs from their customers through rate mechanisms subject to periodic regulatory review and adjustment. Because regulatory review can result in the disallowance of incurred costs found not to have been prudently incurred with the possibility of refunds to ratepayers, there exists some risk to the ultimate recovery of those costs. Regulators can initiate proceedings to investigate the continued usage or the adequacy and operation of the fuel and purchased power recovery clauses of the Utility operating companies. 

The Utility operating companies' cash flows can be negatively affected by the time delays between when gas, power or other commodities are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customers of the purchased costs in rates. On occasion, when the level of incurred costs for fuel and purchased power rises very dramatically, some of the Utility operating companies may agree to defer recovery of a portion of that period's fuel and purchased power

 costs for recovery at a later date, which could increase the near-term working capital and borrowing requirements of those companies. For a description of fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and information regarding the regulatory proceedings for fuel and purchased power recovery, see Note 2 to the financial statements. 

As a result of a challenge by the LPSC, the manner in which the Utility operating companies have traditionally shared the costs associated with coordinated planning, construction and operation of generating resources has been changed by the FERC, which will require adjustment of retail and wholesale rates in the jurisdictions where the Utility operating companies provide service and has introduced additional uncertainty in the ratemaking process. 

The Utility operating companies historically have engaged in the coordinated planning, construction, and operation of generating resources and bulk transmission facilities under the terms of the System Agreement, which is a rate schedule that has been approved by the FERC. In 2005, the FERC issued a decision requiring changes to the cost allocation methodology used in that rate schedule. 

The LPSC, APSC, MPSC and the AEEC have appealed the 2005 FERC decision to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Entergy and the City of New Orleans intervened in the various appeals. The D.C. Circuit issued its decision in April 2008. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the FERC's decision in most respects, but remanded the case to the FERC for further proceedings and reconsideration of its conclusion that it was prohibited from ordering refunds and its determination to implement the bandwidth remedy commencing with calendar year 2006 production costs (with the first payments/receipts commencing in June 2007), rather than commencing the remedy on June 1, 2005. The D.C. Circuit concluded the FERC had failed to offer a reasoned explanation regarding these issues. 

In 2007 through 2010, payments were made by Entergy Arkansas to certain of the Utility operating companies in compliance with the 2005 FERC decision on the cost allocation methodology. There have been challenges to the level of payments made by Entergy Arkansas under the FERC’s decision and the prudence of the Utility operating companies’ production costs. The ability to recover in rates any changes to the cost allocation resulting from the challenges, and timing of such recovery, is uncertain and could be the subject of additional regulatory and other proceedings. For information regarding these and other proceedings associated with the System Agreement, as well as additional information regarding the System Agreement itself, see Note 2 to financial statements, System Agreement Cost Equalization Proceedings. The outcome and timing of this FERC proceeding and resulting recovery and impact on rates cannot be predicted at this time. 

There is uncertainty as to the timing or form of any successor arrangement to the System Agreement and the effect of such arrangement (or absence thereof) will have on Entergy and the Utility operating companies. 

Based upon the effect of the FERC decision described in the preceding risk factor undermining the benefits of continued participation in the System Agreement, in December 2005, Entergy Arkansas provided notice of its intent to terminate its participation in the System Agreement. In November 2007, Entergy Mississippi provided its notice to terminate its participation in the System Agreement. Each notice of termination is effective ninety-six (96) months from the date of notice (December 2013 for Entergy Arkansas and November 2015 for Entergy Mississippi) or such earlier date as authorized by the FERC. The FERC accepted the notices in November 2009; the LPSC and City Council have requested rehearing of that order. In February 2011, the FERC denied the request for rehearing. Entergy cannot predict the timing or the form of any successor arrangement to the System Agreement, or in the alternative, participation in a regional transmission organization (RTO), and the effect such arrangement (or the absence thereof) will have on Entergy or the Utility operating companies. 

For further information regarding the FERC and APSC proceedings see “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation – System Agreement” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries.

A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred, as a result of severe weather could have material adverse effects on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 

Entergy's and its Utility operating companies' results of operations, liquidity and financial condition can be materially adversely affected by the destructive effects of severe weather. Severe weather can also result in significant outages for the customers of the Utility operating companies and, therefore, reduced revenues for the Utility operating companies during the period of the outages. A delay or failure in recovering amounts for storm restoration costs incurred or revenues lost as a result of severe weather could have a material adverse effect on Entergy and those Utility operating companies affected by severe weather. 

The arrangement for the operation of the Utility operating companies’ transmission system faces regulatory challenges and uncertainty in connection with the scheduled expiration of the current Independent Coordinator of Transmission arrangement in November 2012. 

In 2000, the FERC issued an order encouraging utilities to voluntarily place their transmission facilities under the control of an independent RTO. In November 2006, the Utility operating companies installed the SPP as their Independent Coordinator of Transmission (ICT) with responsibility for certain transmission tariff functions, including granting or denying transmission service, administering OASIS, evaluating all transmission requests, and serving as the reliability coordinator. The initial term of the ICT was for four years and in November 2010 the FERC approved an extension of the ICT arrangement for two years, or until November 2012. In its order issued in March 2009 pertaining to a requested modification regarding the weekly procurement process (WPP) through the ICT arrangement, the FERC impos ed conditions related to the ICT arrangement and indicated it wanted an evaluation of the success of the ICT arrangement and transmission access on the Entergy transmission system. In compliance with the FERC’s March 2009 order, the Utility operating companies filed with the FERC a process for evaluating the modification or replacement of the current ICT arrangement. An Entergy Regional State Committee (E-RSC), comprised of one representative from each of the Utility operating companies’ retail regulators has been formed and, in concert with the FERC, has requested a cost/benefit analysis of comparing the ICT arrangement to a proposal under which Entergy would join the SPP RTO. The scope of the study was expanded to consider Entergy joining the Midwest ISO RTO as another alternative. On September 30, 2010, the retained consultant presented its cost/benefit analysis of Entergy and Cleco regions joining the SPP RTO. The cost/benefit analysis in dicates that the Entergy region, including entities beyond the Utility operating companies, would realize a net cost of $438 million to a net benefit of $387 million, primarily depending upon transmission cost allocation issues. Addendum studies, including studies related to Entergy Arkansas and the Utility operating companies joining the Midwest ISO, are to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2011. For further information regarding the FERC and proceedings related to the ICT, see “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation - Federal Regulation -Independent Coordinator of Transmission” section of Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries. 

There is uncertainty as to whether a successor ICT arrangement or alternative such as joining an RTO will have received regulatory approval and whether corresponding changes to cost recovery mechanisms will be in place prior to the termination of the current ICT arrangement in November 2012. To the extent successor ICT arrangements or alternatives have not been approved, an extension of the current ICT arrangement may be required. The outcome of any effort to negotiate an extension of the current arrangement or to make alternative arrangements cannot be predicted at this time.

Nuclear Operating and Regulatory Risks 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy) 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities must consistently operate their nuclear power plants at high capacity factors in order to be successful, and lower capacity factors could materially adversely affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  

Nuclear capacity factors significantly affect the results of operations of certain Utility operating companies, System Energy and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. Nuclear plant operations involve substantial fixed operating costs. Consequently, to be successful, a plant owner must consistently operate its nuclear power plants at high capacity factors. For the Utility operating companies that own nuclear plants, lower capacity factors increase production costs by requiring the affected companies to generate additional energy, sometimes at higher costs, from their fossil facilities or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward markets in order to satisfy their supply needs. For the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants, lower capacity factors directly affect revenues and cash flow from operations. Although most of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear forward sales are on a pure unit-contingent basis, which depends on the availability of the asset, some of the unit-contingent contracts guarantee a specified minimum capacity factor. In the event these plants were operating below the guaranteed capacity factors, Entergy would be subject to price risk for the undelivered power. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear forward sales contracts can also be on a firm LD basis, which subjects Entergy to increasing price risk if capacity factors decrease. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plant owners periodically shutdown their nuclear power plants to replenish fuel. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such refueling outages. If refueling outages last longer than anticipated or if unplanned outages arise, Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. 

Outages at nuclear power plants to replenish fuel require the plant to be “turned off.” Refueling outages generally are planned to occur once every 18 to 24 months and have historically averaged approximately 30 days in duration. Plant maintenance and upgrades are often scheduled during such planned outages. When refueling outages last longer than anticipated or a plant experiences unplanned outages, capacity factors decrease and maintenance costs may increase. Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plants may face lower margins due to higher costs and lower energy sales for unit-contingent power supply contracts or potentially higher energy replacement costs for unit-contingent contracts with capacity guarantees that are not met due to extended or unplanned outag es. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities face risks related to the purchase of uranium fuel (and its conversion, enrichment and fabrication), and the risk of being unable to effectively manage these risks by purchasing from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries could materially adversely affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

Based upon currently planned fuel cycles, Entergy's nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provides substantially adequate nuclear fuel materials and conversion and enrichment services at what Entergy believes are reasonably predictable prices through most of 2011. Entergy's ability to purchase nuclear fuel at reasonably predictable prices, however, depends upon the creditworthiness and performance reliability of uranium miners, as well as upon the structure of Entergy's contracts for the purchase of nuclear fuel. There are a number of possible alternate suppliers that may be accessed to mitigate unexpected supply disruption events, including potentially drawing upon Entergy's own inventory intended for later generation periods depending upon its risk management strategy at tha t time, although the pricing of any such alternate uranium supply from the market will be 

232 

Table of Contents 

Part I Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

dependent upon the market for uranium supply at that time. Entergy buys uranium from a diversified mix of sellers located in a diversified mix of countries, and from time to time purchases from nearly all qualified reliable major market participants worldwide that sell into the U.S. Market prices for nuclear fuel have been extremely volatile from time to time in the past. Although Entergy’s nuclear fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against market risks for several years, costs for nuclear fuel in the future cannot be predicted with certainty due to normal inherent market uncertainties, and price increases could materially adversely affect the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commod ities. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business face the risk that the NRC will change or modify its regulations or suspend or revoke their licenses, which could materially adversely affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

Under the Atomic Energy Act and Energy Reorganization Act, the NRC regulates the operation of nuclear power plants. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke licenses, shut down a nuclear facility and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations or the terms of the licenses for nuclear facilities. A change in the Atomic Energy Act, other applicable statutes, or the applicable regulations or licenses may require a substantial increase in capital expenditures or may result in increased operating or decommissioning costs and could materially adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity or financial condition of Entergy (through Entergy Wholesale Commodities), its Utility operating companies or System Energy. 60;Events at nuclear plants owned by others, as well as those owned by one of these companies, may cause the NRC to initiate such actions. As a result, if an incident were to occur at any nuclear generating unit, whether an Entergy nuclear generating unit or not, it could materially adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy or Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and Entergy Wholesale Commodities are exposed to risks and costs related to operating and maintaining their nuclear power plants, and their failure to maintain operational efficiency at their nuclear power plants could materially adversely affect Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  

The nuclear generating units owned by certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business began commercial operations in the 1970s-1980s. Older equipment may require more capital expenditures to keep each of these nuclear power plants operating efficiently. This equipment is also likely to require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability. Operations at any of the nuclear generating units owned and operated by Entergy's subsidiaries could degrade to the p oint where the affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this were to happen, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. A decision may be made to close a unit rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the unit to full capacity. For Entergy Wholesale Commodities, this could result in lost revenue and increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitments and penalties for failure to perform under their contracts with customers. Moreover, Entergy is becoming more dependent on fewer suppliers for key parts of Entergy's nuclear power plants that may need to be replaced or refurbished. This dependence on a reduced number of suppliers could result in delays in obtaining qualified replacement parts and, therefore, greater expense for Entergy. 

The costs associated with the storage of the spent nuclear fuel of certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as the costs of and their ability to fully decommission their nuclear power plants, could be significantly affected by the timing of the opening of a spent nuclear fuel storage facility, as well as interim storage and transportation requirements.  

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plants incur costs on a periodic basis for the on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel. The approval of a license for a national repository for the storage of spent nuclear fuel, such as the one proposed for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, and the timing of such facility opening, will significantly affect the costs associated with storage of spent nuclear fuel. For example, while the DOE is required by law to proceed with the licensing of Yucca Mountain and, after the license is granted by the NRC, to construct the repository and commence the receipt of spent fuel, the Obama administration has cut the budget for the Yucca Mountain project, and has made various statements that Yucca Mountain will not be the solution for spent fuel storage. These actions may prolong the time before spent fuel is removed from Entergy’s plant sites. Because the DOE has not accomplished its objectives, it is in non-compliance with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and has breached its spent fuel disposal contracts, and Entergy has sued the DOE for such breach. Furthermore, Entergy is uncertain as to when the DOE plans to commence acceptance of spent fuel from its facilities for storage or disposal. As a result, continuing future expenditures will be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at its nuclear sites. The costs of on-site storage are also affected by regulatory requirements for such storage. In addition, the availability of a repository for spent nuclear fuel may affect the 

233

ability to fully decommission the nuclear units and the costs relating to decommissioning. For further information regarding spent fuel storage, see the "Critical Accounting Estimates – Nuclear Decommissioning Costs -- Spent Fuel Disposal” section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy. 

Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear plant owners may be required to pay substantial retrospective premiums imposed under the Price-Anderson Act in the event of a nuclear incident, and losses not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on Entergy's and their results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.  

Accidents and other unforeseen problems at nuclear power plants have occurred both in the United States and elsewhere. The Price-Anderson Act limits each reactor owner's public liability (off-site) for a single nuclear incident to the payment of retrospective premiums into a secondary insurance pool of up to approximately $117.5 million per reactor. With 104 reactors currently participating, this translates to a total public liability cap of approximately $12.2 billion per incident. The limit is subject to change to account for the effects of inflation, a change in the primary limit of insurance coverage, and changes in the number of licensed reactors. As required by the Price-Anderson Act, the Utility operating companies, System Energy, and En tergy Wholesale Commodities carry the maximum available amount of primary nuclear off-site liability insurance with American Nuclear Insurers (currently $375 million for each operating site). Claims for any nuclear incident exceeding that amount are covered under the retrospective premiums paid into the secondary insurance pool. As a result, in the event of a nuclear incident that causes damages (off-site) in excess of the $375 million in primary insurance coverage, each owner of a nuclear plant reactor, including Entergy's Utility operating companies, System Energy, and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident, will be required to pay a retrospective premium, equal to its proportionate share of the loss in excess of the $375 million primary level, up to a maximum of $117.5 million per reactor per incident (Entergy's maximum total contingent obligation per incident is $1.3 billion). The retrospective premium payment is c urrently limited to $17.5 million per year per incident per reactor until the aggregate public liability for each licensee is paid up to the $117.5 million cap.  

NEIL is a utility industry mutual insurance company, owned by its members. All member plants could be subject to assessments (retrospective premium of up to 10 times current annual premium for all policies) should the surplus (reserve) be significantly depleted due to insured losses. As of April 1, 2010, the maximum assessment amounts total $72.7 million for Nuclear South plants and $89.3 million for the Nuclear Northeast plants. Retrospective Premium Insurance available through NEIL’s reinsurance treaty can cover the potential assessments. The Nuclear Northeast plants currently maintain the Retrospective Premium Insurance to cover this potential assessment. 

As an owner of nuclear power plants, Entergy participates in industry self-insurance programs and could be liable to fund claims should a plant owned by a different company experience a major event. Any resulting liability from a nuclear accident may exceed the applicable primary insurance coverage and require contribution of additional funds through the industry-wide program that could significantly affect the results of operations, financial condition or liquidity of Entergy, certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiaries.

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of assets in the decommissioning trusts, which then could require significant additional funding. 

Owners of nuclear generating plants have an obligation to decommission those plants. Certain of the Utility operating companies, System Energy and owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants maintain decommissioning trust funds for this purpose. Certain of the Utility operating companies collect funds from their customers, which are deposited into the trusts covering the units operated for or on behalf of those companies. Those rate collections are based upon operating license lives as well as estimated trust fund earnings and decommissioning costs. In connection with the acquisition of certain nuclear plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners also acquired decommissioning trust funds that are funded in accorda nce with NRC regulations. Assets in these trust funds are subject to market fluctuations, will yield uncertain returns that may fall below projected return rates, and may result in losses resulting from the recognition of impairments of the value of certain securities held in these trust funds. As part of the Pilgrim, Indian Point 1 and 2, Vermont Yankee, and Palisades/Big Rock Point purchases, the former owners transferred decommissioning trust funds, along with the liability to decommission the plants, to the respective Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owners. As part of the Indian Point 1 and 2 purchase, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant owner also funded an additional $25 million to a supplemental decommissioning trust fund. As part of the Palisades transaction, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business assumed responsibility for spent fuel at the decommissioned Big Rock Point nuclear plant, which is located near Charlevoix, Michigan. Once the spent fuel is removed from the site, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business will dismantle the spent fuel storage facility and complete site decommissioning. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business expects to fund this activity from operating revenue, and Entergy is providing $5 million in credit support to provide financial assurance to the NRC for this obligation. 

In 2008, Entergy experienced declines in the market value of assets held in the trust funds for meeting its decommissioning funding assurance obligations for its plants. This decline adversely affected Entergy’s ability to demonstrate compliance with the NRC’s requirements for providing financial assurance for decommissioning funding for some of its plants, which deficiencies have now been corrected. An early plant shutdown, poor investment results (including results from poor performance of or volatility in the capital markets such as occurred in 2008) or higher than anticipated decommissioning costs could cause trust fund assets to be insufficient to meet the decommissioning obligations, with the result that the Entergy Wholesale Com modities nuclear plant owners may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning. For further information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs, see the "Critical Accounting Estimates – Nuclear Decommissioning Costs" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and System Energy and Note 9 to the financial statements. 

New or existing safety concerns regarding operating nuclear power plants and nuclear fuel could lead to restrictions upon the operation of Entergy’s nuclear power plants. 

New and existing concerns are being expressed in public forums about the safety of nuclear generating units and nuclear fuel, in particular in the northeastern United States, which is where five of the six units in the current fleet of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants are located. These concerns have led to, and are expected to continue to lead to, various proposals to Federal regulators and governing bodies in some localities where Entergy's subsidiaries own nuclear generating units for legislative and regulatory changes that could lead to the shut-down of nuclear units, denial of license renewal applications, municipalization of nuclear units, restrictions on nuclear units as a result of unavailability of sites for spent nuclear fuel storage and disposal, or other adverse effects on owning and operating nuclear generating units. Entergy vigorously responds to these concerns and proposals. If any of the existing proposals, or any proposals that may arise in the future with respect to legislative and regulatory changes, become effective, they could have a material adverse effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

A failure to obtain renewed licenses for the continued operation of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants could have a material adverse effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity and could lead to an increase in depreciation rates or an acceleration of the timing for the funding of decommissioning obligations. 

The license renewal and related processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants have been and may continue to be the subject of significant public debate and regulatory and legislative review and scrutiny at the federal and, in certain cases, state level. The operating licenses for Vermont Yankee, Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expire in March 2012, June 2012, September 2013 and December 2015, respectively. Various parties have expressed opposition to renewal of these licenses. Renewal of the Indian Point licenses is the subject of ongoing proceedings before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) of the NRC. Certain contentions have been admitted for litigation and new and amended contentions filed by parties in January and February 2011 have not been a cted upon by the ASLB. Hearings on the contentions admitted by the ASLB currently are expected to begin in early 2012. The ASLB has completed its proceedings regarding Vermont Yankee, but the New England Coalition filed a new contention, which the ASLB denied in October 2010. The New England Coalition requested NRC review of the denial in November 2010. Finally, with respect to the Pilgrim license renewal, the NRC has issued decisions resolving all but one of the issues that were previously appealed by Pilgrim Watch. The NRC remanded one issue to the ASLB, which ordered that testimony be filed in January 2011 and scheduled a hearing for March 9, 2011. Pilgrim Watch filed two new contentions, one of which it subsequently amended, in December 2010 and January 2011. The ASLB for Pilgrim have not decided whether to admit or deny the new contentions. 

In relation to Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation has taken the position that these plant owners must obtain a new state-issued Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality certification as part of the license renewal process. For the Indian Point plants, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities plant owners also must obtain a Coastal Zone Management Act consistency determination from the New York Department of State prior to getting the renewed licenses. For further information regarding these environmental regulations see “Environmental Regulation, Clean Water Act” in Part I, Item 1. 

Pursuant to Vermont law, Vermont Yankee is subject to state approvals to continue operations that are independent of NRC license renewal. Under state law, there is a two-step state law licensing process for obtaining a certificate of public good to continue to operate Vermont Yankee and store newly generated spent fuel after March 21, 2012. First, the Vermont legislature must vote affirmatively to permit the Vermont Public Service Board to consider Vermont Yankee’s application for a renewed certificate of public good for the continued operation of Vermont Yankee and for storage of spent fuel. Second, the Vermont Public Service Board must vote to renew the certificate of public good. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities affiliates that own and operate Vermont Yankee filed an application with th e Vermont Public Service Board in March 2008 to renew its certificate of public good to operate for 20 years beginning March 22, 2012 and to store spent nuclear fuel generated after that date. Ten days of hearings were held in May and June 2009. The Department of Public Service and other parties contended during the hearing that a favorable power purchase agreement for the sale of power from Vermont Yankee to Vermont utilities would be important to demonstrating that renewal of the certificate of public good promoted the public interest. Proceedings in that docket currently are in abeyance. 

During its 2009 session, which concluded in May, several committees of the Vermont General Assembly held hearings on Vermont Yankee, but no bill or resolution was introduced for approval of continued operation and storage of spent nuclear fuel generated after March 21, 2012. In January 2010, the Governor of the State of Vermont issued a statement indicating he would not ask the Vermont General Assembly to consider the renewal of a certificate of public good during its 2010 session, based on the discovery of tritium leakage from Vermont Yankee, concerns about miscommunication by Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee and Entergy Nuclear Operations related to underground piping at Vermont Yankee carrying radionuclides, and other issues including decommissioning. Nevertheless, on February 24, 2010, a bill to authorize the P ublic Service Board to approve the continued operation of Vermont Yankee was defeated in the Vermont Senate by a vote of 26 to 4. Neither house of the Vermont General Assembly has voted on a similar bill since that time.

If the NRC finally denies the applications for the renewal of operating licenses for one or more of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, or a state in which any such nuclear power plant is located does not take actions legally required for the continued operation of such plant, Entergy’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity could be materially adversely affected by loss of revenue and cash flow associated with the plant or plants, potential impairments of the carrying value of the plants, increased depreciation rates, and an accelerated need for decommissioning funds, which could require additional funding. In addition, Entergy may incur increased operating costs depending on any conditions that may be imposed in connection with license renewal. For further discussion regarding the license renewal processes for the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants, see “ENTERGY’S BUSINESS – Entergy Wholesale Commodities – Property – Nuclear Generating Stations” in Part I, Item 1 for Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries. 

The decommissioning trust fund assets for the nuclear power plants owned by Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear plant owners may not be adequate to meet decommissioning obligations if one or more of their nuclear power plants is retired earlier than the anticipated shutdown date or if current regulatory requirements change which then could require additional funding.  

Under NRC regulations, Entergy’s nuclear subsidiaries are permitted to project the NRC-required decommissioning amount based on an NRC formula and the amount in each of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plant's decommissioning trusts combined with other decommissioning financial assurances in place. The projections are made based on the operating license expiration date and the mid-point of the subsequent decommissioning process for each of these nuclear power plants, with the earliest scheduled shutdown being Vermont Yankee in 2012. As a result, if the projected amount of our decommissioning trusts exceeds the NRC-required decommissioning amount, then its decommissioning obligations are considered to be funded in accordance with NRC regulations. In the event the NRC's fo rmula does not sufficiently reflect the actual costs the applicable Entergy subsidiaries would be required to incur to decommission these nuclear power plants, and funding is otherwise inadequate, or if the formula is changed to require increased funding, additional resources would be required. Furthermore, depending upon the level of funding available in the trust funds, the NRC may not permit the trust funds to be used to pay for related costs such as the management of spent nuclear fuel that are not included in the formula. The NRC may also require a plan for the provision of separate funding for spent fuel management costs. In addition to NRC requirements, there are other decommissioning-related obligations for certain of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, which management believes it will be able to satisfy. 

With respect to the decommissioning trusts for Vermont Yankee, Indian Point 2 and Palisades, the total amount in each of those trusts as of December 31, 2010 would not have been sufficient to initiate and complete the immediate near-term decommissioning of the respective unit as of such date, but rather the funds would have been sufficient to place the unit in a condition of safe storage status pending future completion of decommissioning. For example, if an Entergy subsidiary had decided to shutdown and immediately begin decommissioning one of those nuclear power plants on December 31, 2010, its trust funds for the plant would have been insufficient and the applicable Entergy subsidiary would have been required to rely on other capital resources to fund the entire decommissioning obligations unless the completion of decommissioning could be deferred during some number of years of safe storage status (as is permitted by NRC regulations). Thus, if an Entergy subsidiary decides to shutdown one of these nuclear power plants earlier than the scheduled shutdown date and conduct a prompt decommissioning, the applicable Entergy subsidiary may be unable to rely upon only the decommissioning trust to fund the entire decommissioning obligations, which would require it to obtain funding from other sources. 

Further, federal or state regulatory changes, including mandated increases in decommissioning funding or changes in the methods or standards for decommissioning operations, may also increase the funding requirements of, or accelerate the timing for funding of, the obligations related to the decommissioning of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants. As a result, under any of these circumstances, Entergy's results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear power plants are exposed to price risk through either advance sale of energy and capacity into forward markets or accepting spot prices primarily in day-ahead markets. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments in non-utility businesses. In particular, the sale of capacity and energy from the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, unless otherwise contracted, is subject to the fluctuation of market power prices. As of December 31, 2010, Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power generation plants had sold forward 96%, 87%, 40%, 25% and 15% of its generation portfolio's planned energy output for 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Many of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business’s existing long-term contracts expire by the end of 2012. The obligations under most of these agreements are contingent on a generating asset that is operating; if the generation asset is not opera ting, the seller generally is not liable for damages. For some unit-contingent obligations, however, there is also 

a guarantee of availability that provides for the payment to the power purchaser of contract damages, if incurred, in the event the unit owner fails to deliver power as a result of the failure of the specified generation unit to generate power at or above a specified availability threshold. For those obligations that are not unit-contingent, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may be required to make payments to the purchaser based on the difference between the market price at the delivery point and the contract price at times when the unit being hedged is not running, and to the extent market prices are higher than contract prices, the amount of such payments could be substantial. 

Market prices may fluctuate substantially sometimes over relatively short periods of time and at other times experience sustained increases or decreases. Demand for electricity and its fuel stock can fluctuate dramatically, creating periods of substantial under- or over-supply. During periods of over-supply, prices might be depressed. Also, from time to time there may be political pressure, or pressure from regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over wholesale and retail energy commodity and transportation rates, to impose price limitations, credit requirements, bidding rules and other mechanisms to address volatility and other issues in these markets. 

The price that different counterparties offer for forward sales is influenced both by market conditions as well as the contract terms such as damage provisions, credit support requirements and the number of available counterparties interested in contracting for the desired forward period. Depending on differences between market factors at the time of contracting versus current conditions, Entergy Wholesale Commodities' contract portfolio may have average contract prices above or below current market prices, including at the expiration of the contracts, which may significantly affect Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The recent economic downturn and negative trends in the energy commodity markets have resulted in lower natural gas prices, and current prev ailing market prices for electricity in the New York and New England power regions are therefore generally below the prices of Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ existing contracts in those regions. To the extent these market conditions persist, Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ realized price per MWh can be expected to continue to decline. With operating licenses for Vermont Yankee, Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expiring between 2012 and 2015, delays in obtaining extension of the operating licenses and any other approvals required for continued operation of the plants, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may enter into fewer unit-contingent forward sales contracts for output from such plants for periods beyond the license expiration. Instead, in order to hedge future price risk to desired levels, Entergy Wholesale Commodities may enter into firm LD forward sales contacts under which it will be exposed to operational price risk to the extent that the plants do not run as expected. 

Among the factors that could affect market prices for electricity and fuel, all of which are beyond Entergy's control to a significant degree, are: 

  ·    prevailing market prices for natural gas, uranium (and its conversion, enrichment and fabrication), coal, oil, and other fuels used in electric generation plants, including associated transportation costs, and supplies of such commodities;    

  ·    seasonality;    

  ·    availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources and the requirements of a renewable portfolio standard;    

  ·    changes in production and storage levels of natural gas, lignite, coal and crude oil and refined products;    

  ·    liquidity in the general wholesale electricity market, including the number of creditworthy counterparties available and interested in entering into forward sales agreements for Entergy’s full hedging term;    

238 

Table of Contents 

Part I Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

  ·    the actions of external parties, such as the FERC and local independent system operators and other state or Federal energy regulatory bodies, that may impose price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in the energy markets;    

  ·    electricity transmission, competing generation or fuel transportation constraints, inoperability or inefficiencies;    

  ·    the general demand for electricity, which may be significantly affected by national and regional economic conditions;    

  ·    weather conditions affecting demand for electricity or availability of hydroelectric power or fuel supplies;    

  ·    the rate of growth in demand for electricity as a result of population changes, regional economic conditions and the implementation of conservation programs;    

  ·    regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear customers to enter into long-term contracts generally, and contracts for energy in particular;    

  ·    increases in supplies due to actions of current Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear competitors or new market entrants, including the development of new generation facilities, expansion of existing generation facilities, the disaggregation of vertically integrated utilities and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ nuclear markets;    

  ·    union and labor relations;    

  ·    changes in Federal and state energy and environmental laws and regulations and other initiatives, including but not limited to, the price impacts of proposed emission controls such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI); and    

  ·    natural disasters, terrorist actions, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events.    

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by legislative, regulatory or market design changes, as well as liability under, or any future inability to comply with, existing or future regulations or requirements. 

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulation. Compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause the Wholesale Commodities business to incur significant additional costs, and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non-complying facility, the imposition of liens, fines and/or civil or criminal liability. 

Public utilities under the Federal Power Act are required to obtain FERC acceptance of their rate schedules for wholesale sales of electricity. Each of the owners of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities nuclear power plants, as well as Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing, LLC, is a "public utility" under the Federal Power Act by virtue of making wholesale sales of electric energy. The FERC has granted these generating and power marketing companies the authority to sell electricity at market-based rates. The FERC’s orders that grant the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ generating and power marketing companies market-based rate authority reserve the right to revoke or revise that authority if the FERC subsequently determines that the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business can exercise market power in transmission or generation, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ market-based sales are subject to certain market behavior rules, and if any of its generating and power marketing companies were deemed to have violated one of those rules, they would be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of their market-based rate authority and potential penalties of up to $1 million per day per violation. If the Entergy Wholesale Commodities’ generating or power marketing companies were to lose their market-based rate authority, such companies would be required to obtain the FERC’s acceptance of a cost-of-service rate schedule and could become subject to the accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on utilities with cost-based rate schedules. This could have an adverse effect on the rates the En tergy Wholesale Commodities charges for power from its facilities. 

The Entergy Wholesale Commodities business is also affected by legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes to market design, market rules, tariffs, cost allocations and bidding rules imposed by the existing Independent System Operators. The Independent System Operators that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose, and in the future may continue to impose, mitigation, including price limitations, offer caps and other mechanisms, to address some of the volatility and the potential exercise of market power in these markets. These types of price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may have an adverse effect on the profitability of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business' generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. For further inform ation regarding federal, state and local laws and regulation applicable to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see “Entergy’s Business-Regulation of Entergy’s Business” in Part I, Item 1 for Entergy Corporation and its subsidiaries.

Part I Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

The regulatory environment applicable to the electric power industry has undergone substantial changes over the past several years as a result of restructuring initiatives at both the state and federal levels. These changes are ongoing and Entergy cannot predict the future design of the wholesale power markets or the ultimate effect that the changing regulatory environment will have on the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. In addition, in some of these markets, interested parties have proposed material market design changes, including the elimination of a single clearing price mechanism and have raised claims that the competitive marketplace is not working because energy prices in wholesale markets exceed the marginal cost o f operating nuclear power plants, as well as proposals to re-regulate the markets, impose a generation tax or require divestitures by generating companies to reduce their market share. Other proposals to re-regulate may be made and legislative or other attention to the electric power market restructuring process may delay or reverse the deregulation process, which could require material changes to business planning models. If competitive restructuring of the electric power markets is reversed, modified, discontinued or delayed, the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business' results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. 

The nuclear power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to impairment charges in certain circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 

Entergy periodically reviews long-lived assets held in all of its business segments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that recoverability of these assets is uncertain. Generally, the determination of recoverability is based on the undiscounted net cash flows expected to result from such operations and assets. Projected net cash flows depend on the future operating costs associated with the assets, the efficiency and availability of the assets and generating units, and the future market and price for energy over the remaining life of the assets. In particular, the assets of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, including the nuclear power plants, are subject to impairment if adverse market conditions arise and continue (such as declines in market prices for electricity), if adverse r egulatory events occur (including with respect to environmental regulation), if a unit ceases operation or if a unit's operating license is not renewed. Moreover, the failure of the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows, an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results or cash flows or a decline in observable industry market multiples could all result in potential impairment charges for the affected assets.  

As discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the operating licenses for Vermont Yankee, Pilgrim, Indian Point 2 and Indian Point 3 expire between 2012 and 2015 and are currently the subject of license renewal processes at the NRC and the states in which the plants operate. If Entergy concludes that any of these nuclear power plants is unlikely to operate significantly beyond its current license expiration date, which conclusion would be based on a variety of factors, such a conclusion could result in an impairment of part or all of the carrying value of the plant. Any impairment charge taken by Entergy with respect to its long-lived assets, including the nuclear power plants owned by the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, would likely be material in the quarter that the charge is taken and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on Entergy's results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.

General Business Risks 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 

Entergy and the Utility operating companies depend on access to the capital markets and, at times, may face potential liquidity constraints, which could make it more difficult to handle future contingencies such as natural disasters or substantial increases in gas and fuel prices. Disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely affect Entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to meet liquidity needs, access capital and operate and grow their businesses, and the cost of capital. 

Entergy's business is capital intensive and dependent upon its ability to access capital at reasonable rates and other terms. At times there are also spikes in the price for natural gas and other commodities that increase the liquidity requirements of the Utility operating companies. In addition, Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' liquidity needs could significantly increase in the event of a hurricane or other weather-related or unforeseen disaster similar to that experienced in Entergy's service territory with Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008. The occurrence of one or more contingencies, including a delay in regulatory recovery of fuel or purchased power costs or storm restoration costs, higher than expected pension contributions, an acceleration of payments or decreased credit lines, less cash flow from operations than expected or other unknown events, such as future storms, could cause the financing needs of Entergy and its subsidiaries to increase. In addition, accessing the capital markets more frequently in these situations may result in an increase in leverage. Material leverage increases could negatively affect the credit ratings of Entergy and the Utility operating companies, which in turn could negatively affect access to the capital markets. 

The global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the fourth quarter of 2008 and much of 2009. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets, could negatively affect Entergy and its subsidiaries' ability to maintain and to expand their businesses. Events beyond Entergy's control, such as the volatility and disruption in global capital and credit markets in 2008 and 2009, may create uncertainty that could increase its cost of capital or impair its ability to access the capital markets, including the ability to draw on its bank credit facilities. Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the degree of success they will have in renewing or replacing their credit facilities as they come u p for renewal. Moreover, the size, terms, and covenants of any new credit facilities may not be comparable to, and may be more restrictive than, existing facilities. If Entergy and its subsidiaries are unable to access the credit and capital markets on terms that are reasonable, they may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and/or bear an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could impact their ability to grow their businesses, decrease earnings, significantly reduce financial flexibility and/or limit Entergy Corporation's ability to sustain its current common stock dividend level. 

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, Entergy Texas, and System Energy) 

A downgrade in Entergy Corporation's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could negatively affect Entergy Corporation's and its subsidiaries' ability to access capital and/or could require Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries to post collateral, accelerate certain payments or repay certain indebtedness. 

There are a number of factors that rating agencies evaluate to arrive at credit ratings for Entergy Corporation and the Registrant Subsidiaries, including the ability to cover liquidity requirements, the availability of committed external credit support, and Entergy Corporation's share repurchase program, dividend policy and other commitments for capital. If one or more rating agencies downgrade Entergy Corporation's, any of the Utility operating companies', or System Energy's ratings, particularly below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease, and cash or letter of credit collateral demands may be triggered by the terms of a number of commodity contracts, leases and other agreements. 

241

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Most of Entergy Corporation's and its subsidiaries' large customers, suppliers and counterparties require sufficient creditworthiness to enter into transactions. If Entergy Corporation's or its subsidiaries' ratings decline, particularly below investment grade, or if certain counterparties believe Entergy Corporation or the Utility operating companies are losing creditworthiness and demand adequate assurance under fuel, gas and purchased power contracts, the counterparties may require posting of collateral in cash or letters of credit, prepayment for fuel, gas or purchased power or accelerated payment, or counterparties may decline business with Entergy Corporation or its subsidiaries. At December 31, 2010, based on power prices at that time, Entergy had credit exposure of $14 million under the guarantees in place supp orting Entergy Nuclear Power Marketing (an Entergy Wholesale Commodities subsidiary) transactions, $20 million of guarantees that support letters of credit, and $3 million of posted cash collateral. As of December 31, 2010, the credit exposure associated with Entergy Wholesale Commodities assurance requirements could increase by $123 million for a $1 per MMBtu increase in gas prices in both the short- and long-term markets. In the event of a decrease in Entergy Corporation's credit rating to below investment grade, based on power prices as of December 31, 2010, Entergy would have been required to provide approximately $78 million of additional cash or letters of credit under some of the agreements. 

The construction of, and capital improvements to, power generation facilities involve substantial risks. Should construction or capital improvement efforts be unsuccessful, the financial conditions, results of operations or liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies could be materially adversely affected. 

Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' ability to complete construction of power generation facilities in a timely manner and within budget is contingent upon many variables and subject to substantial risks. These variables include, but are not limited to, project management expertise and escalating costs for materials, labor and environmental compliance. Delays in obtaining permits, shortages in materials and qualified labor, suppliers and contractors not performing as required under their contracts, changes in the scope and timing of projects, the inability to raise capital on favorable terms, downward changes in the economy and other events beyond the control of the Utility operating companies or the Entergy Wholesale C ommodities business may occur that may materially affect the schedule, cost and performance of these projects. If these projects are significantly delayed or become subject to cost overruns or cancellation, Entergy and the Utility operating companies could incur additional costs and termination payments, or face increased risk of potential write-off of the investment in the project. For further information regarding capital expenditure plans and other uses of capital in connection with the potential construction of additional generation supply sources within the Utility operating companies' service territory, and as to the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business, see the "Capital Expenditure Plans and Other Uses of Capital" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of the Registrant Subsidiaries. 

The Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs to fulfill their obligations related to, environmental and other matters. 

The businesses in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation by local, state and Federal authorities. These laws and regulations affect the manner in which the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business conduct their operations and make capital expenditures. These laws and regulations also affect how the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business manage air emissions, discharges to water, solid and hazardous waste storage and disposal, cooling and service water intake, the protection of threatened and endangered species, hazardous materials transportation, and similar matters. Federal, state, and local authoriti es continually revise these laws and regulations, and the laws and regulations are subject to judicial interpretation and to the permitting and enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. Developing and implementing plans for facility compliance with these requirements can lead to capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures. Violations of these requirements can subject the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. In addition, the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are subject to liability under 

242

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

these laws for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination of property now or formerly owned or operated by the Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business and of property contaminated by hazardous substances they generate. The Utility operating companies are currently involved in proceedings relating to sites where hazardous substances have been released and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future. The Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business have incurred and expect to incur significant costs related to environmental compliance. 

Emissions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides, mercury, particulates, and other regulated air contaminants from generating plants are potentially subject to increased regulation, controls and mitigation expenses. In addition, existing air regulations and programs promulgated by the EPA often are challenged legally, sometimes resulting in large-scale changes to anticipated regulatory regimes. Risks relating to global climate change and initiatives to compel CO2 emission reductions are discussed below. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be able to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, or if Entergy and its subsidiaries fail to obtain, maintain or comply with any such approval, the operation of its facilities could be stopped or become subject to additional costs. For further information regarding environmental regulation and environmental matters, see the "Regulation of Entergy's Business – Environmental Regulation" section of Part I, Item 1. 

The Utility operating companies, System Energy and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may incur substantial costs related to reliability standards. 

Entergy's business is subject to extensive and mandatory reliability standards. Such standards, which are established by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC), are approved by the FERC and frequently are reviewed, amended and supplemented. Failure to comply with such standards could result in the imposition of fines or civil penalties, and potential exposure to third party claims for alleged violations of such standards. The standards, as well as the laws and regulations that govern them, are subject to judicial interpretation and to the enforcement discretion vested in the implementing agencies. In addition to exposure to civil penalties and fines, the Utility operating companies have incurred and expect to incur significant c osts related to compliance with new and existing reliability standards, including costs associated with the Utility operating companies’ transmission system. Entergy has notified the SERC of potential violations of certain NERC reliability standards, including certain Critical Infrastructure, Protection Facility Connection and System Protection Coordination standards. Entergy is working with the SERC to provide information concerning these potential violations. The changes to the reliability standards applicable to the electric power industry are ongoing, and Entergy cannot predict the ultimate effect that the reliability standards will have on its Utility and Entergy Wholesale Commodities business.  

(Entergy Corporation, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy New Orleans, and Entergy Texas) 

The effects of weather and economic conditions and the related impact on electricity and gas usage, may materially adversely affect the Utility operating companies' results of operations. 

Temperatures above normal levels in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenues, and temperatures below moderate levels in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenues. As a corollary, moderate temperatures tend to decrease usage of energy and resulting revenues. Seasonal pricing differentials, coupled with higher consumption levels, typically cause the Utility operating companies to report higher revenues in the third quarter of the fiscal year than in the other quarters. Extreme weather conditions or storms, however, may stress the Utility operating companies' generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), lim its on their ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. These extreme conditions could have a material adverse effect on the Utility operating companies' financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

Part I Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Industrial sales volume was depressed in the latter part of 2008 and through most of 2009, in part because the overall economy declined, with lower usage across the industrial sector affecting both the large customer industrial segment as well as small and mid-sized industrial customers. Despite the apparently improving economic conditions in the service territories of the Utility operating companies since the fourth quarter 2009, it is possible that continued or recurrent poor economic conditions, combined with increasing rates in certain of the Utility operating companies' service territories, could result in slower or declining sales growth and increased bad debt expense relative to recent years, which could materially adversely affect Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

The effects of climate change and environmental and regulatory obligations intended to compel CO2 emission reductions could materially adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies. 

In an effort to address climate change concerns, Federal, state, and local authorities are calling for additional laws and regulations aimed at known or suspected causes of climate change. For example, in response to the United States Supreme Court's 2007 decision holding that the EPA has authority to regulate emissions of CO2 and other "greenhouse gases" under the Clean Air Act, the EPA, various environmental interest groups and other organizations are focusing considerable attention on CO2 emissions from power generation facilities and their potential role in climate change. In 2010, EPA promulgated its first regulations controlling greenhouse gas emissions from cer tain vehicles and from new and significantly modified stationary sources of emissions, including electric generating units, and additional new source performance standards are expected in 2012. Developing and implementing plans for compliance with CO2 emissions reduction requirements can lead to additional capital, personnel, and operation and maintenance expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing facilities and proposed projects. Violations of such requirements may subject Entergy and the Utility operating companies to enforcement actions, capital expenditures to bring existing facilities into compliance, additional operating costs or operating restrictions to achieve compliance, remediation and clean-up costs, civil penalties, and exposure to third parties' claims for alleged health or property damages or for violations of applicable permits or standards. To the extent Entergy believes any of these costs are recoverable in rates, however, additional material rate increases for customers could be resisted by Entergy's regulators and, in extreme cases, Entergy's regulators might deny or defer timely recovery of these costs. Future changes in environmental regulation governing the emission of CO2 and other "greenhouse gases" could make some of Entergy's electric generating units uneconomical to maintain or operate, and could increase the difficulty that Entergy and its subsidiaries have with obtaining or maintaining required environmental regulatory approvals, which could also materially adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations and liquidity of Entergy and the Utility operating companies. In addition, several lawsuits currently are pending against emitters of greenhouse gas es alleging that these companies are liable for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. These lawsuits seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages. 

In addition to the regulatory and financial risks associated with climate change discussed above, physical risks from climate change include an increase in sea level, wetland and barrier island erosion, risks of flooding and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation, average temperatures and potential increased impacts of extreme weather conditions or storms. Entergy subsidiaries own assets in, and serve, communities that are at risk from sea level rise, changes in weather conditions, storms and loss of the protection offered by coastal wetlands. A significant portion of the nation’s oil and gas infrastructure is located in these areas and susceptible to storm damage that could be aggravated by wetland and barrier island erosion, which co uld give rise to fuel supply interruptions and price spikes. 

These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and transmission and distribution systems resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), limits on the Entergy System's ability to meet peak customer demand, increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Also, to the extent that climate change adversely impacts the economic health of a region or results in energy conservation or demand side management programs, it may adversely impact customer demand and revenues. Such physical or operational risks could have a material adverse effect on Entergy's and the Utility operating companies' financial c ondition, results of operations and liquidity.

Entergy and its subsidiaries may not be adequately hedged against changes in commodity prices, which could materially adversely affect Entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

To manage their near-term financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations, Entergy and its subsidiaries may enter into contracts to hedge portions of their purchase and sale commitments, fuel requirements and inventories of natural gas, uranium (and its conversion), coal, refined products, and other commodities, within established risk management guidelines. As part of this strategy, Entergy and its subsidiaries may utilize fixed- and variable-price forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. However, Entergy and its subsidiaries normally cover only a portion of the exposure of their assets and positions to market price volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. In addition, Enter gy also elects to leave certain volumes during certain years unhedged. To the extent Entergy and its subsidiaries have unhedged positions, fluctuating commodity prices can materially adversely affect Entergy's and its subsidiaries' results of operations and financial position. 

Although Entergy and its subsidiaries devote a considerable effort to these risk management strategies, they cannot eliminate all the risks associated with these activities. As a result of these and other factors, Entergy and its subsidiaries cannot predict with precision the impact that risk management decisions may have on their business, results of operations or financial position. 

Entergy has guaranteed or indemnified the performance of a portion of the obligations relating to hedging and risk management activities. Reductions in Entergy's or its subsidiaries' credit quality or changes in the market prices of energy commodities could increase the cash or letter of credit collateral required to be posted in connection with hedging and risk management activities, which could materially affect Entergy's or its subsidiaries' liquidity and financial position. 

The Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties may not meet their obligations, which may materially adversely affect the Utility operating companies and Entergy Wholesale Commodities. 

The hedging and risk management practices of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business are exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe Entergy and its subsidiaries money, energy, or other commodities will not perform their obligations. Currently, some hedging agreements contain provisions that require the counterparties to provide credit support to secure their obligations to Entergy or its subsidiaries. If the counterparties to these arrangements fail to perform, Entergy or its subsidiaries might be forced to act on the credit support provided and acquire alternative hedging arrangements or draw on the credit support provided by the counterparties, which credit support may not always be adequate to cover the related obligations. In such event, Entergy and its subsidiaries might incur losses in addition to amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties. In addition, the credit commitments of Entergy's lenders under its bank facilities may not be honored for a variety of reasons, including unexpected periods of financial distress affecting such lenders, which could materially adversely affect the adequacy of its liquidity sources. 

The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 and rules and regulations promulgated under the act may adversely affect the ability of the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to utilize certain commodity derivatives for hedging and mitigating commercial risk. 

The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010, which was enacted on July 21, 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the rules and regulations to be promulgated under the act will impose governmental regulation on the over-the-counter derivative market, including the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business to hedge and mitigate commercial risk. Under the act, certain swaps will be subject to mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements. Swap dealers and major participants in the swap market will be subject to capital, margin, registration, reporting, recordkeeping and business conduct requirements with respect to their swap activities. Position limits will also apply to ce rtain swaps activities. The act requires the applicable regulators, which in the case of commodity swaps will be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to engage in substantial rulemaking in order to implement the provisions of the act and such rulemaking is not yet final. Both the Utility operating companies

and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business currently utilize commodity swaps to hedge and mitigate commodity price risk. It is not known whether the act and regulations promulgated under the act will have an adverse effect upon the market for the commodity swaps used by the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business. However, to the extent that the act and regulations promulgated under the act have the effect of increasing the price of such commodity swaps or limiting or reducing the availability of such commodity swaps, whether through the imposition of additional capital, margin or compliance costs upon market participants or otherwise, the financial performance of the Utility operating companies and/or the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business may be adversely affected. 60; To the extent that the Utility operating companies and the Entergy Wholesale Commodities business would be required to post margin in connection with existing or future commodity swaps in addition to any margin currently posted by such entities, such entities may need to secure additional sources of capital to meet such liquidity needs or cease utilizing such commodity swaps. 

Market performance and other changes may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require additional funding. 

The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust under Entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans. A decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements relating to Entergy's benefit plan liabilities. The recent recession and volatility in the capital markets have affected the market value of these assets, which may affect Entergy's planned levels of contributions in the future. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under Entergy's pension and postretirement benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, potentially requiring additional funding. The funding requirements of the obligations re lated to the pension benefit plans can also increase as a result of changes in, among other factors, retirement rates, life expectancy assumptions, or Federal regulations. Guidance pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 rules, effective for the 2008 plan year and beyond, continues to evolve, be interpreted through technical corrections bills and discussed within the industry and by congressional lawmakers. Any changes to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 as a result of these discussions and efforts may affect the level of Entergy's pension contributions in the future. For further information regarding Entergy's pension and other postretirement benefit plans, reference is made to the "Critical Accounting Estimates – Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" section of Management's Financial Discussion and Analysis for Entergy and each of its Registrant Subsidiaries and Note 11 to the financial statements. 

The litigation environment in the states in which certain Entergy subsidiaries operate poses a significant risk to those businesses. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries are involved in the ordinary course of business in a number of lawsuits involving employment, commercial, asbestos, hazardous material and ratepayer matters, and injuries and damages issues, among other matters. States in which the Utility operating companies operate, in particular Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, have proven to be unusually litigious environments. Judges and juries in these states have demonstrated a willingness to grant large verdicts, including punitive damages, to plaintiffs in personal injury, property damage, and business tort cases. Entergy and its subsidiaries use legal and appropriate means to contest litigation threatened or filed against them, but the litigation environment in these states poses a significant business risk. 

Terrorist attacks, future war or risk of war may adversely affect Entergy's results of operations. 

As power generators and distributors, Entergy and its subsidiaries face heightened risk of an act or threat of terrorism, including physical and cyber attacks, either as a direct act against one of Entergy's generation facilities, an act against the transmission and distribution infrastructure used to transport power which affects its ability to operate or an act against the information technology systems and network infrastructure of Entergy and its subsidiaries. 

246 

Table of Contents 

Part I Item 1A & 1B 

Entergy Corporation, Utility operating companies, and System Energy 

Entergy and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure. Despite the implementation of security measures by Entergy and its subsidiaries, all technology systems are vulnerable to disability, failures or unauthorized access due to such activities. If Entergy’s or its subsidiaries’ technology systems were to fail or be breached and be unable to recover in a timely way, Entergy or its subsidiaries may be unable to fulfill critical business functions, and sensitive confidential and other data could be compromised. 

If any such attacks were to occur, Entergy's and the Utility operating companies’ business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The risk of attacks also may cause Entergy and the Utility operating companies to incur increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for its nuclear power plants and other facilities, such as additional physical facility security and additional security personnel, and for systems to protect its information technology and network infrastructure systems. 

Changes in taxation as well as the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact Entergy’s, the Utility operating companies’ and System Energy’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 

Entergy and its subsidiaries make judgments regarding the potential tax effects of various financial transactions and results of operations to estimate their obligations to taxing authorities. These tax obligations include income, franchise, real estate, sales and use and employment-related taxes. These judgments include reserves for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken. Entergy and its subsidiaries also estimate their ability to utilize tax benefits, including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. Changes in federal, state, or local tax laws, adverse tax audit results or adverse tax rulings on posi tions taken by Entergy and its subsidiaries could negatively affect Entergy's, the Utility operating companies' and System Energy's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. For further information regarding Entergy's accounting for tax obligations, reference is made to Note 3 to the financial statements. 

(Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans) 

The effect of higher purchased gas cost charges to customers may adversely affect Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's and Entergy New Orleans' results of operations and liquidity. 

Gas rates charged to customers are comprised primarily of purchased gas cost charges, which provide no return or profit to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, and distribution charges, which provide a return or profit to the utility. Distribution charges are affected by the amount of gas sold to customers. Purchased gas cost charges, which comprise most of a customer's bill and may be adjusted quarterly, represent gas commodity costs that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans recovers from its customers. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's or Entergy New Orleans' cash flows can be affected by differences between the time period when gas is purchased and the time when ultimate recovery from customers occurs. When purchased gas cost charges increase substantially r eflecting higher gas procurement costs incurred by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans, customer usage may decrease, especially in weaker economic times, resulting in lower distribution charges for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana or Entergy New Orleans. 

(System Energy) 

System Energy owns and operates a single nuclear generating facility, and it is dependent on affiliated companies for all of its revenues. 

System Energy's operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% ownership/leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. Charges under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are paid by the Utility operating companies as consideration for their respective entitlements to receive capacity and energy and are payable on a full cost-of-service basis only so long as Grand Gulf remains in commercial operation. The useful economic life of Grand Gulf is finite and is limited by the terms of its operating license, which is currently due to expire on November 1, 2024. System Energy's financial condition depends both on the receipt of payments from the Utility operating companies under the Unit Power Sales Agreement and on the continued commercial operation of Gran d Gulf. For information regarding the Unit Power Sales Agreement and certain other

(Entergy Corporation) 

Entergy Corporation's holding company structure could limit its ability to pay dividends. 

Entergy Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of its operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. Entergy Corporation's ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the payment to it of dividends or distributions by its subsidiaries. The payments of dividends or distributions to Entergy Corporation by its subsidiaries in turn depend on their results of operations and cash flows and other items affecting retained earnings, and on any applicable legal, regulatory, or contractual limitations on subsidiaries’ ability to pay such dividends or distributions. Provisions in the organizational documents, indentures for debt issuances, and other agreements of certain of Entergy Corporation's subsidiaries re strict the payment of cash dividends to Entergy Corporation. For further information regarding dividend or distribution restrictions to Entergy Corporation, reference is made to the "COMMON EQUITY – Retained Earnings and Dividend Restrictions" section of Note 7 to the financial statements.

ENTERGY ARKANSAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income increased $105.7 million primarily due to higher net revenue, a lower effective income tax rate, higher other income, and lower depreciation and amortization expenses, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income increased $19.7 million primarily due to lower other operation and maintenance expenses and a lower effective income tax rate, partially offset by lower net revenue, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, higher nuclear refueling outage expenses, and higher interest expense. 

Net Revenue 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 2,078 GWh, or 10%, in billed electricity usage. Usage in the industrial sector increased primarily in the small industrial customers segment, as well as in the petroleum refining, chemicals, industrial inorganic, and pulp and paper industries, reflecting strong sales growth on continuing signs of economic recovery. The effect of more favorable weather was the primary driver of the increase in residential and commercial sales. 

The provision for regulatory proceedings variance is primarily due to provisions recorded in 2009. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory proceedings affecting Entergy Arkansas. 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a base rate increase effective July 2010, partially offset by the recovery in 2009 of 2008 extraordinary storm costs, as approved by the APSC, which ceased in January 2010. The recovery of storm costs is offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for more discussion of the rate case settlement and the 2008 extraordinary storm costs.

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In 2009, Entergy Arkansas capitalized $12.5 million of Ouachita Plant service charges that were previously expensed. The result of the capitalization in 2009 was a decrease in net revenues with an offsetting decrease in other operation and maintenance expenses. 

The ANO decommissioning trust variance is primarily related to the deferral of investment gains from the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust. The gains resulted in an increase in interest and investment income and a corresponding increase in regulatory charges with no effect on net income in accordance with regulatory treatment. 

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to reduced margin on wholesale contracts including lower capacity billings to an affiliate for the Ouachita unit that was later purchased by the affiliate in November 2009, and lower margins on co-owner contracts, somewhat offset by lower wholesale energy costs. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $98.6 million in rider revenues primarily due to lower System Agreement payments in 2010;    

  ·    a decrease of $95.6 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to a change in the energy cost recovery rider rate change effective April 2010; and    

  ·    a decrease of $72.5 million in gross wholesale revenue due to decreased sales to affiliated customers and the expiration of a wholesale customer contract in 2009.    

The decrease was offset by volume/weather, as discussed above. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average market price of purchased power. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2009 to 2008. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The provision for regulatory proceedings variance is primarily due to provisions recorded in 2009. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of regulatory proceedings affecting Entergy Arkansas. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of less favorable weather and an 11.6% volume decrease in industrial sales primarily in the mid to small customer class. 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to the recovery of 2008 extraordinary storm costs as approved by the APSC, effective January 2009, which is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. Also contributing to the increase are increases in the capacity acquisition rider related to the Ouachita acquisition. The net income effect of the Ouachita plant cost recovery is limited to a portion representing an allowed return on equity with the remainder offset by Ouachita plant costs in other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, and taxes other than income taxes.

Table of Contents 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $119.9 million in gross wholesale revenue due to a decrease in the average price of energy available for resale sales;    

  ·    a decrease of $63.2 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to a change in the energy cost recovery rider effective April 2009 and decreased usage; and    

  ·    the volume/weather discussed above.    

The decrease was offset by an increase of $90.7 million in rider revenues. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average market price of purchased power. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $21.7 million in compensation and benefits costs, resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs;    

  ·    an increase of $6.2 million in vegetation and maintenance expenses; and    

  ·    an increase of $5.4 million in nuclear expenses primarily due to higher labor costs, higher materials costs, and additional projects.    

The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $19.4 million due to 2008 storm costs which were deferred per an APSC order and were recovered through revenues in 2009. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in depreciation rates as a result of the rate case settlement agreement approved by the APSC in June 2010. 

Other income increased primarily due to the investment gains on the ANO 1 and 2 decommissioning trust discussed above in net revenue. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Nuclear refueling outage expenses increased primarily due to the amortization of higher expenses associated with the planned maintenance and refueling outage at ANO 1 which ended in December 2008 and the planned maintenance and refueling outage at ANO 2 which ended in September 2009. 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  ·    the capitalization in 2009 of $12.5 million of Ouachita service charges previously expensed in 2008;    

  ·    prior year storm damage charges as a result of several storms hitting Entergy Arkansas’s service territory in 2008, including Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in the third quarter 2008. Entergy Arkansas discontinued regulatory storm reserve accounting beginning July 2007 as a result of the APSC order issued in Entergy Arkansas’s rate case. As a result, non-capital storm expenses of $41 million were charged to other operation and maintenance expenses. In December 2008, $19.4 million of these storm expenses were deferred per an APSC order and were recovered through revenues in 2009; and    

251 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

  ·    a decrease of $10.8 million in payroll-related and benefits costs.    

The decrease was partially offset by the following: 

  ·    an increase of $17.9 million due to higher fossil costs primarily due to a full year of Ouachita costs in 2009 and higher fossil plant outage costs in 2009;    

  ·    an increase of $14.4 million due to the reinstatement of storm reserve accounting effective January 2009;    

  ·    an increase of $9.6 million in nuclear expenses primarily due to increased nuclear labor and contract costs;    

  ·    an increase in legal expenses as a result of a reimbursement in April 2008 of $7 million of costs in connection with a litigation settlement; and    

  ·    an increase of $4.0 million in customer service costs primarily as a result of write-offs of uncollectible customer accounts.    

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in long-term debt outstanding as a result of the issuance of $300 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2008. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2010, 2009, and 2008 were 39.6%, 55.0%, and 67.2%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Cash flow from operations increased $128.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in net revenue as discussed above, ice storm spending in 2009, and the collection of previously under-recovered fuel costs through the normal operation of the energy cost recovery rider. The increase was offset by an increase of $112 million in pension contributions, and an increase of $65 million in income tax payments. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. In 201 0 Entergy Arkansas made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The payments result from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Arkansas previously received cash tax benefits and from estimated federal income tax payments for tax year 2010. 

252 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Cash flow from operations decreased $76.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to income tax payments of $1.4 million in 2009 compared to income tax refunds of $57.9 million in 2008 and an increase in storm spending in 2009, partially offset by a decrease of $14.1 million in pension contributions. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $131.7 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    the sale of one-third of the Ouachita plant for $75 million in 2009;    

  ·    proceeds from the sale/leaseback of nuclear fuel of $118.6 million in 2009. See Note 18 to the financial statements for a discussion of the consolidation of the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity effective January 1, 2010; and    

  ·    increases in nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to the ANO 1 reactor coolant pump upgrade project and security upgrades.    

The increase was offset by a decrease in distribution construction expenditures as a result of an ice storm hitting Entergy Arkansas’s service territory in the first quarter 2009. 

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $327.0 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the purchase of the Ouachita plant for $210 million in September 2008 and the sale of one-third of the plant for $75 million in 2009, decreases in nuclear construction expenditures resulting from various nuclear projects that occurred in 2008, and decreases in distribution and transmission construction expenditures resulting from Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike in 2008. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in distribution construction expenditures as a result of an ice storm hitting Entergy Arkansas’s service territory in the first quarter 2009. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash flow used in financing activities increased $23.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    retirements of $450 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010;    

  ·    retirements of $139.5 million of pollution control bonds in 2010; and    

  ·    an increase of $125.1 million in common stock dividends paid in 2010.    

The increase was offset by: 

  ·    issuances of $575 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010; and    

  ·    the issuance in August 2010 of $124.1 million of storm cost recovery bonds by Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Arkansas.    

Entergy Arkansas’s financing activities used $56.0 million of cash in 2009 compared to providing $187.6 million in 2008 primarily due to: 

  ·    issuance of $300 million of first mortgage bonds in July 2008;    

  ·    an increase of $23.4 million in common stock dividends paid in 2009; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

Decreases in Entergy Arkansas’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Arkansas’s payable to the money pool decreased by $77.9 million in 2008. 

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Capital Structure 

Entergy Arkansas’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Calculation excludes the securitization bonds, which are non-recourse to Entergy Arkansas.    

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt, preferred stock without sinking fund, and common equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Arkansas uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Arkansas’s financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Arkansas requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt and preferred stock maturities;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    dividend and interest payments.    

Following are the amounts of Entergy Arkansas’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $211 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Arkansas, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In addition, Entergy Arkansas currently expects to contribute approximately $107.1 million to its pension plans and approximately $26.3 million to other postretirement plans in 2011; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011. 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Arkansas has $40.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Arkansas reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in projec t plans, the ability to access capital, and the outcome of Entergy Arkansas’s exit from the Entergy System Agreement (which is discussed in “System Agreement” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis). Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Arkansas pays dividends to Entergy Corporation from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Arkansas’s long-term debt indentures restrict the amount of retained earnings available for the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2010, Entergy Arkansas had restricted retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $458 million. 

White Bluff Coal Plant Project 

In June 2005 the EPA issued final Best Available Retrofit Control Technology (BART) regulations that could potentially result in a requirement to install SO2 and NOx pollution control technology on certain of Entergy’s coal and oil generation units. The rule leaves certain BART determinations to the states. The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) prepared a State Implementation Plan (SIP) for Arkansas facilities to implement its obligations under the Clean Air Visibility Rule. The ADEQ determined that Entergy Arkansas’s White Bluff power plant affects a Class I Area’s visibility and will be subject to the EPA’s presumptive BART requirements to install scrubbers and low NOx burners. Under then current regulations, the scrubbers would have had to be operational by October 2013. Entergy filed a petition in December 2009 with the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology (APC&E) Commission requesting a variance from this deadline, however, because the EPA has not approved Arkansas’s Regional Haze SIP and the EPA has expressed concerns about Arkansas’s Regional Haze SIP and questioned the appropriateness of issuing an air permit prior to that approval. Entergy Arkansas’s petition requested that, consistent with federal law, the compliance deadline be changed to as expeditiously as practicable, but in no event later than five years after EPA approval of the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP. The APC&E Commission approved the variance at its March 26, 2010 meeting. No party appealed the variance, and the ruling is final. 160;The timeline for EPA action on the Arkansas Regional Haze SIP is uncertain at this time. 

Currently, the White Bluff project is suspended, but Entergy Arkansas estimates that its share of the project could cost approximately $500 million. The plant would continue to operate during construction, although an outage would be necessary to complete the tie-in of the scrubbers. Entergy continues to review potential environmental spending needs and financing alternatives for any such spending, and future spending estimates are likely to change based on the results of this continuing analysis.

Ouachita Power Plant 

Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC in September 2007 for its approval of the Ouachita plant acquisition, including full cost recovery. In June 2008 the APSC approved Entergy Arkansas’s acquisition of the Ouachita plant and approved recovery of the acquisition and ownership costs through a rate rider. The APSC also approved the planned sale of one-third of the capacity and energy to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Arkansas purchased the Ouachita plant in September 2008. 

In August 2008, the LPSC issued an order approving an uncontested settlement between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff authorizing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s purchase, under a life-of-unit agreement, of one-third of the capacity and energy from the 789 MW Ouachita power plant. The LPSC’s approval was subject to certain conditions, including a study to determine the costs and benefits of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana exercising an option to purchase one-third of the plant (Unit 3) from Entergy Arkansas. In April 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking approval of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana exercising its option to convert its purchased power agreement into the ownership interest in Unit 3 and a one-third interest in the Ouachita common facilities.& #160; In September 2009 the LPSC, pursuant to an uncontested settlement, approved the acquisition and a cost recovery mechanism. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchased Unit 3 and a one-third interest in the Ouachita common facilities for $75 million in November 2009. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Arkansas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred stock issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

Entergy Arkansas may refinance or redeem debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Arkansas require prior regulatory approval. Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in Entergy Arkansas’s corporate charters, bond indentures, and other agreements. Entergy Arkansas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

Entergy Arkansas’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In May 2007, $1.8 million of Entergy Arkansas’s receivable from the money pool was replaced by a note receivable from Entergy New Orleans. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

In April 2010, Entergy Arkansas renewed its credit facility through April 2011 in the amount of $75.125 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Entergy Arkansas credit facility as of December 31, 2010. 

Entergy Arkansas has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the APSC under which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $250 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Arkansas’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Arkansas has also obtained an order from the APSC authorizing long-term securities issuances through December 2012.

State and Local Rate Regulation 

Retail Rates 

2009 Base Rate Filing 

In September 2009, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC for a general change in rates, charges, and tariffs. In June 2010 the APSC approved a settlement and subsequent compliance tariffs that provide for a $63.7 million rate increase, effective for bills rendered for the first billing cycle of July 2010. The settlement provides for a 10.2% return on common equity. 

2006 Base Rate Filing 

In August 2006, Entergy Arkansas filed with the APSC a request for a change in base rates. In June 2007, after hearings on the filing, the APSC ordered Entergy Arkansas to reduce its annual rates by $5 million, and set a return on common equity of 9.9% with a hypothetical common equity level lower than Entergy Arkansas’s actual capital structure. For the purpose of setting rates, the APSC disallowed a portion of costs associated with incentive compensation based on financial measures and all costs associated with Entergy’s stock-based compensation plans, and left Entergy Arkansas with no mechanism to recover $52 million of costs previously accumulated in Entergy Arkansas’s storm reserve and $18 million of removal costs associated with the term ination of a lease. The base rate change was implemented effective for bills rendered after June 15, 2007. 

Entergy Arkansas sought to overturn the APSC’s decision, but in December 2008 the Arkansas Court of Appeals upheld almost all aspects of the APSC decision. After considering the progress of the proceeding in light of the decision of the Court of Appeals, Entergy Arkansas recorded in the fourth quarter 2008 an approximately $70 million charge to earnings, on both a pre- and after-tax basis because these are primarily flow-through items, to recognize that the regulatory assets associated with the storm reserve costs, lease termination removal costs, and stock-based compensation were no longer probable of recovery. In April 2009 the Arkansas Supreme Court denied Entergy Arkansas’s petition for review of the Court of Appeals decision. 

Production Cost Allocation Rider 

The APSC approved a production cost allocation rider for recovery from customers of the retail portion of the costs allocated to Entergy Arkansas as a result of the System Agreement proceedings. These costs cause an increase in Entergy Arkansas’s deferred fuel cost balance, because Entergy Arkansas pays the costs over seven months but collects them from customers over twelve months. 

See Note 2 to the financial statements and Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - System Agreement” for discussions of the System Agreement proceedings. 

Energy Cost Recovery Rider 

Entergy Arkansas’s retail rates include an energy cost recovery rider. In early October 2005, the APSC initiated an investigation into Entergy Arkansas's interim energy cost recovery rate. The investigation focused on Entergy Arkansas's 1) gas contracting, portfolio, and hedging practices; 2) wholesale purchases during the period; 3) management of the coal inventory at its coal generation plants; and 4) response to the contractual failure of the railroads to provide coal deliveries. In March 2006, the APSC extended its investigation to cover the costs included in Entergy Arkansas's March 2006 annual energy cost rate filing, and a hearing was held in the APSC energy cost recovery investigation in October 2006. 

In January 2007, the APSC issued an order in its review of the energy cost rate. The APSC found that Entergy Arkansas failed to maintain an adequate coal inventory level going into the summer of 2005 and that Entergy Arkansas should be responsible for any incremental energy costs resulting from two outages caused by employee and contractor error. The coal plant generation curtailments were caused by railroad delivery problems and Entergy

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Arkansas has since resolved litigation with the railroad regarding the delivery problems. The APSC staff was directed to perform an analysis with Entergy Arkansas's assistance to determine the additional fuel and purchased energy costs associated with these findings and file the analysis within 60 days of the order. After a final determination of the costs is made by the APSC, Entergy Arkansas would be directed to refund that amount with interest to its customers as a credit on the energy cost recovery rider. Entergy Arkansas requested rehearing of the order. In March 2007, in order to allow further consideration by the APSC, the APSC granted Entergy Arkansas's petition for rehearing and for stay of the APSC order. 

In October 2008, Entergy Arkansas filed a motion to lift the stay and to rescind the APSC's January 2007 order in light of the arguments advanced in Entergy Arkansas's rehearing petition and because the value for Entergy Arkansas's customers obtained through the resolved railroad litigation is significantly greater than the incremental cost of actions identified by the APSC as imprudent. In December 2008, the APSC denied the motion to lift the stay pending resolution of Entergy Arkansas's rehearing request and of the unresolved issues in the proceeding. The APSC ordered the parties to submit their unresolved issues list in the pending proceeding, which the parties did. In February 2010 the APSC denied Entergy Arkansas's request for rehearing, and held a h earing in September 2010 to determine the amount of damages, if any, that should be assessed against Entergy Arkansas. A decision is pending. Entergy Arkansas expects the amount of damages, if any, to have an immaterial effect on its results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 

The APSC also established a separate docket to consider the resolved railroad litigation, and in February 2010 it established a procedural schedule that concluded with testimony through September 2010. Testimony has been filed and the APSC will now decide the case based on the record in the proceeding, including the prefiled testimony. 

Storm Cost Recovery 

Entergy Arkansas January 2009 Ice Storm 

In January 2009, a severe ice storm caused significant damage to Entergy Arkansas’s transmission and distribution lines, equipment, poles, and other facilities. A law was enacted in April 2009 in Arkansas that authorizes securitization of storm damage restoration costs. In June 2010, the APSC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of storm cost recovery bonds, including carrying costs of $11.5 million and $4.6 million of up-front financing costs. In August 2010, Entergy Arkansas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Arkansas, issued $124.1 million of storm cost recovery bonds. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional discussion of the issuance of the storm cost recovery bonds.  

Federal Regulation 

See “System Agreement”, “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation regarding Reliability Standards”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Finan cial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. 

Nuclear Matters 

Entergy Arkansas owns and operates, through an affiliate, the ANO 1 and ANO 2 nuclear power plants. Entergy Arkansas is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating nuclear plants. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of either ANO 1 or ANO 2, Entergy Arkansas may be required to file with the APSC a rate mechanism to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.

Entergy Arkansas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials associated with components within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to ANO and is managed in accordance with industry standard practices and guidelines and includes in-service examinations, replacement and mitigation strategy. Several major modifications to the ANO units have been implemented to mitigate the susceptibility of large bore dissimilar metal welds. In addition, a replacement reactor vessel head has been fabricated for ANO 2 and is onsite. Routine inspections of the existing ANO 2 reactor vessel head have identified no significant material degradation issues for that component. These inspections will continue at planned refueling outages. 60;Timing for installation of the new reactor vessel head will be based on the results of future inspection efforts. 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy Arkansas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Arkansas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. See “Uses of Capital” above for a discussion of the potential requirement to install scrubbers and low NOx b urners at Entergy Arkansas’s White Bluff coal plant. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Arkansas’s financial position or results of operations. 

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs 

See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Arkansas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain co mponents of the calculation.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified, defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for furt her discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. 

Cost Sensitivity 

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands):

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. 

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Arkansas in 2010 was $31.7 million. Entergy Arkansas anticipates 2011 qualified pension cost to be approximately $33.7 million. Entergy Arkansas’s contributions to the pension trust were $137 million in 2010 and are currently estimated to be approximately $107.1 million in 2011; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Arkansas in 2010 were $18.9 million, including $5.3 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Arkansas expects 2011 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $17 million, including $6.3 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Arkansas expects to contribute approximately $26.3 million to other postretirement plans in 2011.

ENTERGY GULF STATES LOUISIANA, L.L.C. 

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income increased $37.7 million primarily due to higher net revenue, a lower effective income tax rate, and lower interest expense, offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses, lower other income, and higher taxes other than income taxes. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income increased $8.3 million primarily due to higher net revenue, lower interest expense, and lower taxes other than income taxes, partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate and lower other income. 

Net Revenue 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to formula rate plan increases effective November 2009, January 2010, and September 2010. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan increases. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1,861 GWh, or 10%, in billed electricity usage, primarily in the industrial sector as a result of increased consumption in the chemicals industry, and also the effect of more favorable weather on the residential and commercial sectors. 

The fuel recovery variance resulted primarily from an adjustment to deferred fuel costs in the fourth quarter 2009 relating to unrecovered nuclear fuel costs incurred since January 2008 that will now be recovered after a revision to the fuel adjustment clause methodology. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $100.9 million in rider revenues due to lower System Agreement credits in 2010;    

  ·    formula rate plan increases effective November 2009, January 2010, and September 2010, as noted above;    

  ·    an increase of $64.5 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to increased usage primarily in the industrial sector; and    

  ·    the increase related to volume/weather, as discussed above.    

  ·       

270 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The increase was partially offset by a decrease in gross wholesale revenues primarily due to the transfer of several wholesale customers to Entergy Texas in 2009 and decreased system agreement remedy receipts. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the average market price of purchased power. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2009 to 2008. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The fuel recovery variance resulted primarily from an adjustment to deferred fuel costs in the fourth quarter 2009 relating to unrecovered nuclear fuel costs incurred since January 2008 that will now be recovered after a revision to the fuel adjustment clause methodology. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in unbilled sales volume, including the effects of Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike which decreased sales volume in 2008, and the effect of more favorable weather. 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to: 

  ·    a formula rate plan provision of $3.7 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009 for refunds made to customers in November 2009 in accordance with a settlement approved by the LPSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the settlement;    

  ·    a credit passed on to customers as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and    

  ·    a net decrease in the formula rate plan effective September 2008 to remove interim storm recovery upon the Act 55 financing of storm costs as well as the storm damage accrual. A portion of the decrease is offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan.    

The decrease was partially offset by a formula rate plan increase effective September 2008 and November 2009. Refer to “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - State and Local Rate Regulation -Retail Rates - Electric” and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the formula rate plan. 

271 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $638.2 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates;    

  ·    a decrease of $245 million in gross wholesale revenue due to a decrease in the average price of energy available for resale sales; and    

  ·    a decrease of $33.5 million in gross gas revenue primarily due to lower fuel rates.    

The decrease was partially offset by formula rate plan increases effective November 2009 as discussed above. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power and a decrease in deferred fuel expense due to decreased recovery from customers of fuel costs in addition to a credit recorded in the fourth quarter 2009 as a result of a revision to the fuel adjustment clause methodology as explained above. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to an increase of $12.4 million in fossil expenses due to higher plant maintenance costs and plant outages and a $12.1 million increase in compensation and benefits costs resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefit costs. 

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in local franchise taxes as a result of higher revenues primarily in the residential and commercial sectors and an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of higher millage rates, a higher 2010 assessment, and a reduction in capitalized property taxes as compared to 2009. 

Other income decreased primarily due to a decrease of $30.1 million in interest and investment income related to the debt assumption agreement with Entergy Texas. In June 2010, Entergy Texas repaid the outstanding assumed debt and the debt assumption agreement was terminated. 

Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in long-term debt outstanding as a result of redemptions of first mortgage bonds of $292 million in December 2009, $68 million in June 2010, and $304 million in November 2010, partially offset by issuances of first mortgage bonds of $300 million in October 2009 and $250 million in October 2010. See Note 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of the decrease in long-term debt. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of $7.7 million in storm damage reserves in 2009 as a result of the completion of the Act 55 storm cost financing and a decrease of $5.5 million in payroll-related costs. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $7.8 million in nuclear expenses due to higher nuclear labor and contract costs. 

Taxes other than income taxes decreased primarily due to a decrease in local franchise taxes as a result of lower residential and commercial revenue. 

272 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Other income decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $15.6 million in interest and investment income related to the debt assumption agreement with Entergy Texas. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana remained primarily liable on this debt, of which $168 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2009 and $770 million remained outstanding as of December 31, 2008;    

  ·    the decrease of $4.7 million in carrying charges on Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita storm restoration costs as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and    

  ·    a decrease of $3.5 million in interest earned on money pool investments.    

The decrease is partially offset by additional distributions of $8.7 million earned on preferred membership interests purchased from Entergy Holdings Company with the proceeds received from the Act 55 storm costs financings and $5.5 million in carrying charges on Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm restoration costs. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing. 

Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease of $421 million in long-term debt outstanding. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a description of the decrease in long-term debt. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates were 28.5%, 36.8%, and 28.3% for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased $491.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    storm cost proceeds of $240.3 million received from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings;    

  ·    the absence in 2010 of the storm restoration spending that occurred in 2009. See “Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” below and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the storm cost financings; and    

  ·    income tax refunds of $16.8 million in 2010 compared to income tax payments of $60.6 million in 2009. In 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana received tax cash refunds in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The refunds resulted from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Gulf States Louisiana previously made cash tax payments.    

273 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $328 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to storm cost proceeds of $274.7 million received from the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC) as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing in 2008, an under-collection of fuel costs through typical fuel adjustment clause activity, and income tax payments of $60.6 million in 2009 compared to income tax refunds of $1.8 million in 2008, partially offset by a decrease of $28.2 million in pension contributions and fluctuation in the timing of accounts receivable and payable activity. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $255.1 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    the investment of $150.3 million in affiliate securities and the investment of $90.1 million in the storm reserve escrow account as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings. See “Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” below and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the storm cost financings;    

  ·    proceeds from the sale/leaseback of nuclear fuel of $72.8 million in 2009. See Note 18 to the financial statements for discussion of the consolidation of nuclear fuel company variable interest entities effective January 1, 2010; and    

  ·    an increase in construction expenditures primarily due to $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at River Bend. See “New Nuclear Development” below.    

The increase was partially offset by the purchase of one-third of the Ouachita Power Plant for $75 million in November 2009 from Entergy Arkansas and money pool activity. See “Ouachita Power Plant” below for a discussion of the purchase of the Ouachita Power Plant. 

Increases in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool increased by $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to increasing by $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $232.9 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to: 

  ·    the investment of $189.4 million in affiliate securities in 2008 as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing;    

  ·    higher construction expenditures in 2008 due to Hurricane Gustav;    

  ·    the purchase of the Calcasieu Generating Facility for $56 million in March 2008; and    

  ·    timing differences between nuclear fuel purchases and fuel trust reimbursements.    

The decrease was partially offset by money pool activity and the purchase of one-third of the Ouachita Power Plant for $75 million in November 2009 from Entergy Arkansas. See “Ouachita Power Plant” below for a discussion of the purchase of the Ouachita Power Plant. Increases in Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool increased by $38.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to decreasing by $43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. font> 

Financing Activities 

Financing activities used cash of $173.8 million in 2010 compared to providing cash of $146.7 million in 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    net cash issuances of $178.2 million of long-term debt in 2009;    

  ·    net cash redemptions of $38.6 million of long-term debt in 2010; and    

  ·    an increase of $93.6 million in common equity distributions.

Financing activities provided cash of $146.7 million in 2009 compared to using cash of $102.3 million in 2008 primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of 5.59% Series first mortgage bonds in October 2009 and a decrease of $73.5 million in common equity distributions, partially offset by the retirement of $119 million of long term debt in 2009. See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt. 

Capital Structure 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. The calculation below does not reduce the debt by the debt assumed by Entergy Texas ($0 as of December 31, 2010 and $168 million as of December 31, 2009) because Entergy Gulf States Louisiana was primarily liable on the debt. The final repayment in June 2010 by Entergy Texas of its obligations under the debt assumption agreement is the primary reason for the decline in debt to capital at December 31, 2010.

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, it primarily includes unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expects to contribute $24.6 million to its pension plans and $7.8 million to other postretirement plans in 2011; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011. 

Also, in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has $279.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, chan ges in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred membership interest maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

As an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s long-term debt indentures contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred membership interests. 

Ouachita Power Plant 

In August 2008, the LPSC issued an order approving an uncontested settlement between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC Staff authorizing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s purchase, under a life-of-unit agreement, of one-third of the capacity and energy from the 789 MW Ouachita power plant. The LPSC’s approval was subject to certain conditions, including a study to determine the costs and benefits of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana exercising an option to purchase one-third of the plant (Unit 3) from Entergy Arkansas. In April 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking approval of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana exercising its option to convert its purchased power agreement into the ownership interest in Unit 3 and a one-th ird interest in the Ouachita common facilities. In September 2009 the LPSC, pursuant to an uncontested settlement, approved the acquisition and a cost recovery mechanism. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana purchased Unit 3 and a one-third interest in the Ouachita common facilities for $75 million in November 2009. 

New Nuclear Development 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana provided public notice to the LPSC of their intention to make a filing pursuant to the LPSC’s general order that governs the development of new nuclear generation in Louisiana. The project option being developed by the companies is for new nuclear generation at River Bend. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, together with Entergy Mississippi, have been engaged in the development of options to construct new nuclear generation at the River Bend and Grand Gulf sites. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are leading the development at River Bend, and Entergy Mississippi is leading the development at Grand Gulf. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In the first quarter 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each paid for and recognized on its books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at the River Bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on

the books of Entergy New Nuclear Utility Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company’s current participation level in the project. In March 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC seeking approval to continue the development activities. The parties have agreed to a procedural schedule that includes a hearing in May 2011. In January 2011, parties filed testimony responding to the application, and the only testimony was filed by the LPSC staff. The LPSC staff did not oppose the requested relief but suggested several conditions to LPSC approval. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred membership interest issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana may refinance or redeem debt and preferred equity/membership interests prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

All debt and common and preferred equity/membership interest issuances by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana require prior regulatory approval. Preferred equity/membership interest and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years:

Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike 

In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s service territory. The storms resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. In October 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana drew all of its $85 million funded storm reserve. On October 15, 2008, the LPSC approved Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s request to defer and accrue carrying cost on unrecovered storm expenditures during the period the company seeks regulatory recovery. The approval was without prejudice to the ultimate resolution of the total amount of prudently incurred storm cost or final carr ying cost rate.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009. In September 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed with the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Regular Session of 2007 (Act 55 financings). Entergy G ulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita storm costs were financed primarily by Act 55 financings, as discussed below. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and Act 55 financing savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset rider.  

In December 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy Louisiana, including carrying costs. Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover $7.2 million of their storm restoration spending. The stipulation also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $200 million when the Act 55 financings are accomplished. In March and April 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and other parties to the proceeding filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that includes these terms and also includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana's proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $15.5 million and $27.75 million of customer benefits, respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $3.1 million and $5.55 million for five years. A stipulation hearing was held before the ALJ on April 13, 2010. On April 21, 2010, the LPSC approved the settlement and subsequently issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate the implementation of the Act 55 financings. In June 2010 the Louisiana State Bond Commission approved the Act 55 financings. 

In July 2010 the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (LCDA) issued $244.1 million in bonds under Act 55. From the $240.3 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $90 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and transferred $150.3 million directly to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana used $150.3 million to acquire 1,502,643.04 Class B preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 9% annual distribution rate. D istributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2010, and the membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA, and there is no recourse against Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC, and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not report the collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state. 

Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita 

In August and September 2005, Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit Entergy Gulf States Inc.’s jurisdictions in Louisiana and Texas. The storms resulted in power outages; significant damage to electric distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure; and the temporary loss of sales and customers due to mandatory evacuations. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pursued a range of initiatives to recover storm restoration and business continuity costs and incremental losses. Initiatives included obtaining reimbursement of certain costs covered by insurance and pursuing recovery through existing or new rate mechanisms regulated by the FERC and local regulatory bodies, in combination with securitization.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In March 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed at the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Legislature (Act 55 financings). The Act 55 financings are expected to produce additional customer benefits as compared to traditional securitization. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset rider. On April 8, 2008, the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority (LPFA), which is the issuer of the bonds pursuant to the Act 55 financings, approved requests for the Act 55 financings. On April 10, 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC Staff filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana’s proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $10 million and $30 million of customer benefits, respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $2 million and $6 million for five years. On April 16, 2008, the LPSC approved the settlement and issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate implementation of the Act 55 financings. In May 2008, the Louisiana State Bond Commission granted final approval of the Act 55 financings. 

In August 2008 the LPFA issued $278.4 million in bonds under the aforementioned Act 55. From the $274.7 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $87 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and transferred $187.7 million directly to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana invested $189.4 million, including $1.7 million that was withdrawn from the restricted escrow account as approved by the April 16, 2008 LPSC orders, in exchange for 1,893,918.39 Class A preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC that carry a 10% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2008 and have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LPFA, and there is no recourse against Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC, and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not report the collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state. 

State and Local Rate Regulation 

The rates that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the LPSC is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

Retail Rates - Electric 

In March 2005, the LPSC approved a settlement proposal to resolve various dockets covering a range of issues for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana. The settlement included the establishment of a three-year formula rate plan for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana that, among other provisions, establishes a return on common equity mid-point of 10.65% for the initial three-year term of the plan and permits Entergy Gulf States Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate proceeding. Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed range of 9.9% to 11.4% are allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its initial formula rate p lan filing in June 2005. The formula rate plan was subsequently extended one year. As discussed below the formula rate plan has been extended, with return on common equity provisions consistent with previously approved provisions, to cover the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years.

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, L.L.C. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In May 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2007 test year. The filing reflected a 9.26% return on common equity, which was below the allowed earnings bandwidth, and indicated a $5.4 million revenue deficiency, offset by a $4.1 million decrease in required additional capacity costs. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented a $20.7 million formula rate plan decrease, subject to refund, effective the first billing cycle in September 2008. The decrease included removal of interim storm cost recovery and a reduction in the storm damage accrual. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana then implemented a $16.0 million formula rate plan increase, subject to refund, effective the first billing cycle in October 2008 to collect previously deferred and ongo ing costs associated with LPSC approved additional capacity, including the Ouachita power plant. In November 2008 Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed to implement an additional increase of $9.3 million to recover the costs of a new purchased power agreement. 

In October 2009 the LPSC approved a settlement that resolved Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s 2007 test year filing and provided for a new formula rate plan for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. 10.65% is the target midpoint return on equity for the new formula rate plan, with an earnings bandwidth of +/- 75 basis points (9.90% - 11.40%). Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, effective with the November 2009 billing cycle, reset its rates to achieve a 10.65% return on equity for the 2008 test year. The rate reset, a $44.3 million increase that includes a $36.9 million cost of service adjustment, plus $7.4 million net for increased capacity costs and a base rate reclassification, was implemented for the November 2009 billing cycle, and the rate reset was subject to refund pending review of the 2008 tes t year filing that was made in October 2009. In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented an additional $23.9 million rate increase pursuant to a special rate implementation filing made in December 2009, primarily for incremental capacity costs approved by the LPSC. In May 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint report on the 2008 test year filing and requested that the LPSC accept the report, which resulted in a $0.8 million reduction in rates effective in the June 2010 billing cycle and a $0.5 million refund. At its May 19, 2010 meeting, the LPSC accepted the joint report. 

In May 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2009 test year. The filing reflected a 10.25% return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth, indicating no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan. The filing does reflect, however, a revenue requirement increase to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for the LPSC-regulated 70% share of River Bend, in response to a NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. The filing also reflected a rate increase for incremental capacity costs. In July 2010 the LPSC approved a $7.8 million increase in the revenue requirement for decommiss ioning, effective September 2010. In August 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana made a revised 2009 test year filing. The revised filing reflected a 10.12% earned return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth resulting in no cost of service adjustment. The revised filing also reflected two increases outside of the formula rate plan sharing mechanism: (1) the previously approved decommissioning revenue requirement, and (2) $25.2 million for capacity costs. The rates reflected in the revised filing became effective, beginning with the first billing cycle of September 2010.  Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and the LPSC staff subsequently submitted a joint report on the 2009 test year filing consistent with these terms and the LPSC approved the joint report in January 2011. 

Retail Rates - Gas 

In January 2011, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2010. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 8.84% and a revenue deficiency of $0.3 million. The sixty-day review and comment period for this filing remains open. 

In January 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ended September 30, 2009. The filing showed an earned return on common equity of 10.87%, which is within the earnings bandwidth of 10.5% plus or minus fifty basis points, resulting in no rate change. In April 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed a revised evaluation report reflecting changes agreed upon with the LPSC Staff. The revised evaluation report also resulted in no rate change. 

In January 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ending September 30, 2008. The filing showed a revenue deficiency of $529 thousand based on a return on common equity mid-point of 10.5%. In April 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented a $255 thousand rate increase pursuant to an uncontested settlement with the LPSC staff.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In January 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed with the LPSC its gas rate stabilization plan for the test year ending September 30, 2007. The filing showed a revenue deficiency of $3.7 million based on a return on common equity mid-point of 10.5%. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana implemented a $3.4 million rate increase in April 2008 pursuant to an uncontested agreement with the LPSC staff. 

Fuel and purchased power cost recovery 

In January 2003, the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate a proceeding to audit the fuel adjustment clause filings of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and its affiliates. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana through its fuel adjustment clause for the period 1995 through 2004. The LPSC Staff issued its audit report in December 2010. The report recommends the disallowance of $23 million of costs which, with interest, will total $43 million. $2.3 million of this total relates to a realignment to and recovery through base rates of certain SO2 costs. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed comments disputing the findin gs in the report and requested a hearing. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana has recorded provisions for the estimated effect of this proceeding. 

In April 2010 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's purchased gas adjustment clause filings for its gas distribution operations. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana for the period from 2003 through 2008. Discovery is in progress, but a procedural schedule has not been established. 

Industrial and Commercial Customers 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s industrial customer base. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana does not currently expect additio nal significant losses to cogeneration because of the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers. 

Federal Regulation 

See “System Agreement”, “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation regarding Reliability Standards”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Finan cial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. 

Nuclear Matters 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the River Bend nuclear power plant. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of River Bend, Entergy Gulf S tates Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Gulf States Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated.  

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy’s financial position or results of operations. 

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs 

See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries’ Management’s Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for furth er discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in 2010 was $10 million. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana anticipates 2011 qualified pension cost to be $9.4 million. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana contributed $31 million to its pension plans in 2010 and estimates 2011 pension contributions to be approximately $24.6 million; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in 2010 were $16.6 million, including $3.4 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expects 2011 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $16.8 million, including $3.9 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expects to contribute approximately $7.8 million to its other postretirement plans in 2011.

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income decreased slightly by $1.4 million primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, a higher effective income tax rate, and higher interest expense, almost entirely offset by higher net revenue. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income increased $75.3 million primarily due to a lower effective income tax rate, higher other income, higher net revenue, and lower other operation and maintenance expenses, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expenses. 

Net Revenue 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory credits. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 2,253 GWh, or 8%, in billed electricity usage. Usage in the industrial sector increased primarily as a result of increased consumption by a large customer in the petroleum refining industry, as well as increases in the chemical industry. The effect of more favorable weather was the primary driver of the increase in the residential and commercial sales. 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a net increase in the formula rate plan effective November 2009 which allowed Entergy Louisiana to reset its rates to achieve a 10.25% return on equity for the 2008 test year. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of settlement and the formula rate plan reset. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $200.7 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to higher fuel rates and increased usage;    

  ·    an increase of $114.9 million in rider revenues primarily due to lower System Agreement credits in 2010; and    

  ·    the increase related to volume/weather, as discussed above.    

292 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to an increase in the average market price of purchased power, an increase in demand, and an increase in the recovery from customers of deferred fuel costs, partially offset by a decrease in the average market price of natural gas. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2009 to 2008. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 504 GWh in billed electricity usage in all sectors, an increase in unbilled sales volume, including the effect of Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike which decreased sales volume in 2008, and the effect of more favorable weather. 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to: 

      ·   a credit passed on to customers as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing;    

      ·   a net decrease in the formula rate plan effective August 2008 to remove interim storm cost recovery upon the Act 55 financing of storm costs as well as the storm damage accrual. A portion of the decrease is offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan; and    

      ·   a formula rate plan provision of $12.9 million recorded in the third quarter 2009 for refunds made to customers in November 2009 in accordance with a settlement approved by the LPSC. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the settlement.    

The decrease was offset by an interruptible load provision of $13.4 million recorded in 2008 for rate refunds that occurred in August and September 2009 and formula rate plan increases effective November 2009. 

Refer to “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina” and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the interim recovery of storm costs and the Act 55 storm cost financing. 

Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges (credits) 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease of $763.4 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates and a decrease of $108.1 million in rider revenues. The decrease was partially offset by an increase related to volume/weather, as discussed above. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power and a decrease in the recovery from customers of deferred fuel costs. 

Other regulatory charges decreased primarily due to the amortization of deferred capacity charges, which ceased in August 2009, as a result of the May 2006 formula rate plan filing with the LPSC, the recognition of interim storm cost recoveries that ceased in July 2008 with the Act 55 financing of storm costs, and the refunds of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita insurance proceeds occurring over a twelve-month period. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the formula rate plan, the interim recovery of storm costs, and the Act 55 storm cost financing.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $16.2 million in compensation and benefits costs, resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs;    

  ·    an increase of $6.4 million in fossil expenses due to higher outage expenses compared to prior year; and    

  ·    an increase of $5.9 million in nuclear expenses due to higher nuclear labor costs.    

Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $400 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2009. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of $6.5 million in payroll-related costs and a decrease of $6.4 million in loss reserves in 2009, including a decrease in the storm damage reserve. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $9.0 million in nuclear expenses due to higher nuclear labor and contract costs. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Other income increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $25 million in distributions earned on preferred membership interests purchased from Entergy Holdings Company with the proceeds received from the Act 55 storm cost financing. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina” and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing; and    

  ·    an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to more construction work in progress throughout 2009.    

Interest and other charges increased slightly primarily due to the issuance of $300 million of 6.50% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2008 and the issuance of $400 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2009, substantially offset by an increase in the allowance for borrowed funds used during construction due to more construction work in progress in 2009. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2010, 2009, and 2008 were 22.3%, 16.2%, and 31.0%, respectively. The decline in the rate for 2009 is primarily due to the reallocation of Entergy Corporation consolidated tax benefits based on the partial settlement of IRS audits of prior tax years, the exclusion of dividend income from Entergy Louisiana’s preferred membership interest in Entergy Holdings Company, LLC, and the flow-through of the equity component of AFUDC. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rate and for a discussion of the IRS audits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $844.5 million in 2010 primarily due to proceeds of $462.4 million received from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings, the absence in 2010 of the storm restoration spending that occurred in 2009, a decrease of $195.3 million in income tax payments, and increased recovery of fuel costs due to a higher fuel rate for the period, offset by an increase of $58.5 million in pension contributions. See “Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” below and Note 2 to the financial statements herein for a discussion of the storm cost financings. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISC USSION AND ANALYSIS – Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits. In 2010, Entergy Louisiana made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The payments result from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy Louisiana previously received cash tax benefits and from estimated federal income tax payments for tax year 2010. 

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $994.7 million in 2009 primarily due to storm cost proceeds of $679 million received in 2008 from the LURC as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing and income tax payments of $223.6 million in 2009 compared to income tax refunds of $12.7 million in 2008. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a discussion of the tax payments in 2009. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $425.1 million in 2010 primarily due to the investment in 2010 of $262.4 million in affiliate securities and the investment of $200 million in the storm reserve escrow account as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financings, partially offset by decreased construction expenditures as a result of higher distribution construction expenditures in 2009 due to Hurricane Gustav and decreased fossil construction expenditures due to the suspension of the Little Gypsy repowering project in 2009. The decrease in construction expenditures was partially offset by an increase of $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at River Bend, as discussed below, increased nuclear construction expenditures pr imarily due to the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project and the dry fuel storage project, and increased transmission construction expenditures primarily due to additional reliability work. See “Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike” below and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the storm cost financings. See MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS - “Little Gypsy Repowering Project” for a discussion of the suspension. 

295 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $734.7 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to: 

  ·    the investment in 2008 of $545 million in affiliate securities as a result of the Act 55 storm cost financing. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina” and Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Act 55 storm cost financing;    

  ·    higher construction expenditures in 2008 due to Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike;    

  ·    the suspension of the Little Gypsy repowering project in 2009. See “Little Gypsy Repowering Project” below for a discussion of the suspension;    

  ·    lower transmission construction expenditures in 2009; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

The decrease was partially offset by increased nuclear construction expenditures primarily due to the Waterford 3 steam generator replacement project, the dry fuel storage project, security upgrades, and the reactor coolant pump upgrades project. 

Decreases in Entergy Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Louisiana’s receivable from the money pool decreased $8.4 million in 2009 compared to increasing $61.2 million in 2008. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Financing Activities 

Entergy Louisiana’s financing activities used $99.6 million in 2010 compared to providing $361.3 million in 2009. The following cash flow activity occurred: 

  ·    net cash redemptions of $120 million of first mortgage bonds in 2010;    

  ·    the retirement in January 2010 of the $30 million Series D note by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity;    

  ·    the issuance in October 2010 of $115 million of 5% Revenue Bonds Series 2010;    

  ·    the payment on credit borrowings of $24.1 million by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity;    

  ·    $20.6 million in common equity distributions in 2009; and    

  ·    a principal payment of $17.3 million in 2010 for the Waterford 3 sale-leaseback obligation compared to a principal payment of $6.6 million in 2009.    

Entergy Louisiana’s cash flow provided by financing activities increased $134.3 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the issuance of $400 million of 5.40% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2009 compared to the issuance of $300 million of 6.50% Series first mortgage bonds in August 2008 and the repurchase in 2008 of $60 million of Auction Rate governmental bonds, partially offset by an increase of $20.6 million in common equity distributions paid in 2009. 

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Capital Structure 

Entergy Louisiana’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. The decrease in the debt to capital for Entergy Louisiana as of December 31, 2010 is primarily due to an increase in common equity because Entergy Louisiana did not make common equity distributions in 2010. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable, capital lease obligations, and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and members’ equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Louisiana uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Louisiana’s financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Louisiana requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt and preferred equity maturities;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    distribution and interest payments.    

Following are the amounts of Entergy Louisiana’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $194 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Louisiana, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Vidalia purchased power agreement and the Unit Power Sales Agreement, both of which are discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Louisiana currently expects to contribute approximately $53 million to its pension plans and approximately $9.5 million to other postretirement plans in 2011; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011. 

297

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Louisiana has $373.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Louisiana reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth, including the purchase of Acadia Unit 2 and the replacement of the Waterford 3 steam generators, which are discussed below, and dry cask spent fuel storage. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Entergy identified resources in the Summer 2009 Request for Proposal, including a self-build option at Entergy Louisiana’s Ninemile site. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. 

Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred membership interest maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

As an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, Entergy Louisiana pays distributions from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Louisiana’s long-term debt indentures contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred membership interests. As of December 31, 2010, Entergy Louisiana had member’s equity unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $465 million. 

Acadia Unit 2 Purchase Agreement 

In October 2009, Entergy Louisiana announced that it has signed an agreement to acquire Unit 2 of the Acadia Energy Center, a 580 MW generating unit located near Eunice, La., from Acadia Power Partners, LLC, an independent power producer. The Acadia Energy Center, which entered commercial service in 2002, consists of two combined-cycle gas-fired generating units, each nominally rated at 580 MW. Entergy Louisiana proposes to acquire 100 percent of Acadia Unit 2 and a 50 percent ownership interest in the facility’s common assets for approximately $300 million. In a separate transaction, Cleco Power acquired Acadia Unit 1 and the other 50 percent interest in the facility’s common assets. Upon closing the transaction, Cleco Power will serve as operator for the entire facility. 160; Entergy Louisiana has committed to sell one-third of the output of Unit 2 to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana in accordance with terms and conditions detailed under the existing Entergy System Agreement. Entergy Louisiana’s purchase of the plant is contingent upon, among other things, obtaining necessary approvals, including full cost recovery, from various federal and state regulatory and permitting agencies. 

Entergy Louisiana and Acadia Power Partners also have entered into two purchase power agreements that are intended to provide access to the capacity and energy output of the unit during the period before the acquisition closes. The initial purchase power agreement was a call option agreement that commenced on June 1, 2010 and terminated on September 30, 2010. Beginning October 1, 2010, Entergy Louisiana began purchasing 100 percent of the output of Acadia Unit 2 under a tolling agreement. The LPSC has approved both purchase power agreements. 

In December 2010, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana filed an executed uncontested settlement term sheet, which was approved by the LPSC in January 2011. The term sheet provides for three scenarios allowing the transaction to proceed, depending upon the outcome of a FERC ruling on modifications to a System Agreement schedule to include acquisition adjustments. If the FERC approves the modifications to the System Agreement schedule prior to closing, Entergy Louisiana will purchase 100 percent of the plant and sell one-third of the output to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana as proposed. In the other two scenarios, Entergy Louisiana will retain 

298 

Table of Contents

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

and include in rates 100 percent of the unit for a period of up to one year, at which time Entergy Louisiana must file either to permanently retain 100 percent ownership of the unit or enter into a joint ownership arrangement with Entergy Gulf States Louisiana pursuant to which Entergy Gulf States Louisiana would purchase one-third of the unit. The commercial issues associated with joint ownership of a single generation unit are being evaluated, and it is possible Entergy Louisiana may seek approvals to purchase the full output of the unit permanently. Closing of the sale to Entergy Louisiana is expected to occur by the end of the first quarter 2011. 

Waterford 3 Steam Generator Replacement Project 

Entergy Louisiana planned to replace the Waterford 3 steam generators, along with the reactor vessel closure head and control element drive mechanisms, in the spring 2011. Replacement of these components is common to pressurized water reactors throughout the nuclear industry. In December 2010, Entergy Louisiana advised the LPSC that the replacement generators will not be completed and delivered by the manufacturer in time to install them during the spring 2011 refueling outage. During the final steps in the manufacturing process, the manufacturer discovered separation of stainless steel cladding from the carbon steel base metal in the channel head of both replacement steam generators (RSGs), in areas beneath and adjacent to the divider plate. As a result of this damage, the manufacturer will be unable to meet the contractual delivery deadlines, and the RSGs cannot be installed in the spring 2011. After the manufacturer completes its analysis of the cause of the failure and repair options, Entergy Louisiana will work with the manufacturer to fully develop and evaluate repair options and to revise the project schedule. In the interim, the spring 2011 outage has been converted to a normal refueling outage and inspection. Prior to the delay, Entergy Louisiana estimated that it would spend approximately $511 million on this project, and the planned construction estimate above includes approximately $190 million in 2011 for the completion of this project. A revised estimate will be made after the development of the new project schedule, although it is likely that the estimated cost will increase, including increased carrying cost due to the delayed construction period. 

In June 2008, Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC for approval of the replacement project, including full cost recovery. Following discovery and the filing of testimony by the LPSC staff and an intervenor, the parties entered into a stipulated settlement of the proceeding. The LPSC unanimously approved the settlement in November 2008. The settlement resolved the following issues: 1) the accelerated degradation of the steam generators is not the result of any imprudence on the part of Entergy Louisiana; 2) the decision to undertake the replacement project at the then-estimated cost of $511 million is in the public interest, is prudent, and would serve the public convenience and necessity; 3) the scope of the replacement project is in the public interest; 4) undertaking the replacement project at the t arget installation date during the 2011 refueling outage is in the public interest; and 5) the jurisdictional costs determined to be prudent in a future prudence review are eligible for cost recovery, either in an extension or renewal of the formula rate plan or in a full base rate case including necessary proforma adjustments. Upon completion of the replacement project, the LPSC will undertake a prudence review with regard to the following aspects of the replacement project: 1) project management; 2) cost controls; 3) success in achieving stated objectives; 4) the costs of the replacement project; and 5) the outage length and replacement power costs. In June 2010, Entergy Louisiana filed an application at the LPSC to certify the estimated first year revenue requirement associated with the project. In January 2011 the procedural schedule in the proceeding was suspended pending the development and filing of a revised project schedule and cost estimate. 

Little Gypsy Repowering Project 

In April 2007, Entergy Louisiana announced that it intended to pursue the solid fuel repowering of a 538 MW unit at its Little Gypsy plant. In March 2009 the LPSC voted in favor of a motion directing Entergy Louisiana to temporarily suspend the repowering project and, based upon an analysis of the project’s economic viability, to make a recommendation regarding whether to proceed with the project. This action was based upon a number of factors including the recent decline in natural gas prices, as well as environmental concerns, the unknown costs of carbon legislation and changes in the capital/financial markets. In April 2009, Entergy Louisiana complied with the LPSC’s directive and recommended that the project be suspended for an extended period of time of three years or more. In May 2009 the LPSC issued an order declaring that Entergy Louisiana’s decision to place the Little Gypsy project into a longer-term suspension of three years or more is in the public interest and prudent. 

In October 2009, Entergy Louisiana made a filing with the LPSC seeking permission to cancel the Little Gypsy repowering project and seeking project cost recovery over a five-year period. In June 2010 and August 2010, the LPSC Staff and Intervenors filed testimony. The LPSC Staff (1) agreed that it was prudent to move the project from long-term suspension to cancellation and that the timing of the decision to suspend on a longer-term basis was not imprudent; (2) indicated that, except for $0.8 million in compensation-related costs, the costs incurred should be deemed prudent; (3) recommended recovery from customers over ten years but stated that the LPSC may want to 

299 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 consider 15 years; (4) allowed for recovery of carrying costs and earning a return on project costs, but at a reduced rate approximating the cost of debt, while also acknowledging that the LPSC may consider ordering no return; and (5) indicated that Entergy Louisiana should be directed to securitize project costs, if legally feasible and in the public interest. In the third quarter 2010, in accordance with accounting standards, Entergy Louisiana determined that it is probable that the Little Gypsy repowering project will be abandoned and accordingly has reclassified $199.8 million of project costs from construction work in progress to a regulatory asset. This accounting reclassification does not modify Entergy Louisiana’s requested relief pending before the LPSC. A hearing on the issues, except for cost allocation among customer classes, was held before the ALJ in November 2010. In January 2011 all parties conducted a mediation on the disputed issues, resulting in a settlement of all disputed issues, including cost recovery and cost allocation. The settlement is expected to be presented to the LPSC for approval in the first quarter 2011. 

New Nuclear Development 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana provided public notice to the LPSC of their intention to make a filing pursuant to the LPSC’s general order that governs the development of new nuclear generation in Louisiana. The project option being developed by the companies is for new nuclear generation at River Bend. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, together with Entergy Mississippi, have been engaged in the development of options to construct new nuclear generation at the River Bend and Grand Gulf sites. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are leading the development at River Bend, and Entergy Mississippi is leading the development at Grand Gulf. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In the first quarter 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana each paid for and recognized on its books $24.9 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at the River Bend site; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Utility Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will share costs going forward on a 50/50 basis, which reflects each company’s current participation level in the project. In March 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed with the LPSC seeking approval to continue the development activities. The parties have agreed to a procedural schedule that includes a hearing in May 2011. In January 2011, parties filed testimony responding to the application, and the only t estimony was filed by the LPSC staff. The LPSC staff did not oppose the requested relief but suggested several conditions to LPSC approval. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Louisiana’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred membership interest issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new and existing facilities.    

Entergy Louisiana may refinance or redeem debt and preferred membership interests prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and distribution rates are favorable. 

All debt and common and preferred membership interest issuances by Entergy Louisiana require prior regulatory approval. Preferred membership interest and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. Entergy Louisiana has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Entergy Louisiana’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

Entergy Louisiana has a credit facility in the amount of $200 million scheduled to expire in August 2012. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2010. 

Entergy Louisiana obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $250 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Louisiana’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Louisiana has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2011. 

Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike 

In September 2008, Hurricane Gustav (and, to a much lesser extent, Hurricane Ike) caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Louisiana’s service territory. The storms resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. On October 9, 2008, Entergy Louisiana drew all of its $134 million funded storm reserve. On October 15, 2008, the LPSC approved Entergy Louisiana’s request to defer and accrue carrying costs on unrecovered storm expenditures during the period the company seeks regulatory recovery. The approval was without prejudice to the ultimate resolution of the total amount of prudently incurred storm costs or final carryi ng costs rate. 

Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana filed their Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery case with the LPSC in May 2009. In September 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed with the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Regular Session of 2007 (Act 55 financings). Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana’s Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita storm costs were financed primarily by Act 55 financings, as discussed below. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and Act 55 financing savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset rider. 

In December 2009, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana entered into a stipulation agreement with the LPSC Staff that provides for total recoverable costs of approximately $234 million for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $394 million for Entergy Louisiana, including carrying costs. Under this stipulation, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana agrees not to recover $4.4 million and Entergy Louisiana agrees not to recover $7.2 million of their storm restoration spending. The stipulation also permits replenishing Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $90 million and Entergy Louisiana's storm reserve in the amount of $200 million when the Act 55 financings are accomplished. In March and April 2010, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and other parties to the proceeding filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that includes these terms and also includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana’s and Entergy Louisiana's proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $15.5 million and $27.75 million of customer benefits, respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $3.1 million and $5.55 million for five years. A stipulation hearing was held before the ALJ on April 13, 2010. On April 21, 2010, the LPSC approved the settlement and subsequently issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate the implementation of the Act 55 financings. In June 2010 the Louisiana State Bond Commission approved the Act 55 financings.

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In July 2010 the Louisiana Local Government Environmental Facilities and Community Development Authority (LCDA) issued $468.9 million in bonds under Act 55. From the $462.4 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LCDA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $200 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $262.4 million directly to Entergy Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Louisiana used $262.4 million to acquire 2,624,297.11 Class B preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 9% annual distribution rate. Distributions are payable quarterly commencing o n September 15, 2010, and the membership interests have a liquidation price of $100 per unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. 

Entergy Louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LCDA and there is no recourse against Entergy or Entergy Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy Louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC, and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy Louisiana does not report the collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state. 

Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina 

In August and September 2005, Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, along with extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in and around Entergy Louisiana's service territory, caused catastrophic damage. The storms and flooding resulted in widespread power outages; significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure; and the temporary loss of sales and customers due to mandatory evacuations and destruction of homes and businesses due to wind, rain, and extended periods of flooding. Entergy pursued a broad range of initiatives to recover storm restoration and business continuity costs and incremental losses. Initiatives included obtaining reimbursement of certain costs covered by insurance and pursuing recovery through ex isting or new rate mechanisms regulated by the FERC and local regulatory bodies, in combination with securitization. 

In March 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation (LURC), an instrumentality of the State of Louisiana, filed at the LPSC an application requesting that the LPSC grant financing orders authorizing the financing of Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana storm costs, storm reserves, and issuance costs pursuant to Act 55 of the Louisiana Legislature (Act 55 financings). The Act 55 financings are expected to produce additional customer benefits as compared to traditional securitization. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana also filed an application requesting LPSC approval for ancillary issues including the mechanism to flow charges and savings to customers via a Storm Cost Offset rider. On April 8, 2008, the Louisiana Public Facilities Authority (LPFA), which is the issuer of the bonds pursuant to the Act 55 financings, approved requests for the Act 55 financings. On April 10, 2008, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC Staff filed with the LPSC an uncontested stipulated settlement that includes Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana’s proposals under the Act 55 financings, which includes a commitment to pass on to customers a minimum of $10 million and $30 million of customer benefits, respectively, through prospective annual rate reductions of $2 million and $6 million for five years. On April 16, 2008, the LPSC approved the settlement and issued two financing orders and one ratemaking order intended to facilitate implementation of the Act 55 financings. In May 2008, the Louisiana State Bond Commission granted final approval of the Act 55 financings. 

In July 2008 the LPFA issued $687.7 million in bonds under the aforementioned Act 55. From the $679 million of bond proceeds loaned by the LPFA to the LURC, the LURC deposited $152 million in a restricted escrow account as a storm damage reserve for Entergy Louisiana and transferred $527 million directly to Entergy Louisiana. From the bond proceeds received by Entergy Louisiana from the LURC, Entergy Louisiana invested $545 million, including $17.8 million that was withdrawn from the restricted escrow account as approved by the April 16, 2008 LPSC orders, in exchange for 5,449,861.85 Class A preferred, non-voting, membership interest units of Entergy Holdings Company LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy, that carry a 10% annual distribution rate.& #160; Distributions are payable quarterly commencing on September 15, 2008 and have a liquidation price of $100 per

unit. The preferred membership interests are callable at the option of Entergy Holdings Company LLC after ten years under the terms of the LLC agreement. The terms of the membership interests include certain financial covenants to which Entergy Holdings Company LLC is subject, including the requirement to maintain a net worth of at least $1 billion. 

Entergy Louisiana does not report the bonds on its balance sheet because the bonds are the obligation of the LPFA, and there is no recourse against Entergy Louisiana in the event of a bond default. To service the bonds, Entergy Louisiana collects a system restoration charge on behalf of the LURC, and remits the collections to the bond indenture trustee. Entergy Louisiana does not report the collections as revenue because it is merely acting as the billing and collection agent for the state. 

State and Local Rate Regulation 

The rates that Entergy Louisiana charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Louisiana is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the LPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

In May 2005 the LPSC approved a rate filing settlement that included the adoption of a three-year formula rate plan, the terms of which included an ROE mid-point of 10.25% for the initial three-year term of the plan and permit Entergy Louisiana to recover incremental capacity costs outside of a traditional base rate proceeding. Under the formula rate plan, over- and under-earnings outside an allowed regulatory range of 9.45% to 11.05% will be allocated 60% to customers and 40% to Entergy Louisiana. The initial formula rate plan filing was made in May 2006. As discussed below the formula rate plan has been extended, with return on common equity provisions consistent with previously approved provisions, to cover the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. div> 

In May 2008, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2007 test year, seeking an $18.4 million rate increase, comprised of $12.6 million of recovery of incremental and deferred capacity costs and $5.8 million based on a cost of service revenue deficiency related to continued lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the loss of customers due to Hurricane Katrina. In August 2008, Entergy Louisiana implemented a $43.9 million formula rate plan decrease to remove interim storm cost recovery and to reduce the storm damage accrual. Entergy Louisiana then implemented a $16.9 million formula rate plan increase, subject to refund, effective the first billing cycle in September 2008, comprised of $12.6 million of recovery of incrementa l and deferred capacity costs and $4.3 million based on a cost of service deficiency. 

In October 2009 the LPSC approved a settlement that resolved Entergy Louisiana’s 2006 and 2007 test year filings provided for a new formula rate plan for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 test years. 10.25% is the target midpoint return on equity for the new formula rate plan, with an earnings bandwidth of +/- 80 basis points (9.45% - 11.05%). Entergy Louisiana was permitted, effective with the November 2009 billing cycle, to reset its rates to achieve a 10.25% return on equity for the 2008 test year. The rate reset, a $2.5 million increase that included a $16.3 million cost of service adjustment less a $13.8 million net reduction for decreased capacity costs and a base rate reclassification, was implemented for the November 2009 billing cycle, and the rate reset was subject to refund pending review of the 2008 test year filing that was made in October 2009. In April 2010, Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff submitted a joint report on the 2008 test year filing and requested that the LPSC accept the report, which resulted in a $0.1 million reduction in rates effective in the May 2010 billing cycle and a $0.1 million refund. In addition, Entergy Louisiana moved the recovery of approximately $12.5 million of capacity costs from fuel adjustment clause recovery to base rate recovery. At its April 21, 2010 meeting, the LPSC accepted the joint report. 

In May 2010, Entergy Louisiana made its formula rate plan filing with the LPSC for the 2009 test year. The filing reflected a 10.82% return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth, indicating no cost of service rate change is necessary under the formula rate plan. The filing does reflect, however, a revenue requirement increase to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for Waterford 3, in response to a NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. The filing also reflected a rate change for incremental capacity costs. In July 2010 the LPSC approved a $3.5 million increase in the retail revenue

requirement for decommissioning, effective September 2010. In August 2010 Entergy Louisiana made a revised 2009 test year formula rate plan filing. The revised filing reflected a 10.82% earned return on common equity, which is within the allowed earnings bandwidth resulting in no cost of service adjustment. The filing also reflected two increases outside of the formula rate plan sharing mechanism: (1) the previously approved decommissioning revenue requirement, and (2) $2.2 million for capacity costs. The rates reflected in the revised filing became effective beginning with the first billing cycle of September 2010. Entergy Louisiana and the LPSC staff subsequently submitted a joint report on the 2009 test year filing consistent with these terms and the LPSC approved the joint repo rt in December 2010. 

In April 2010 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate an audit of Entergy Louisiana's fuel adjustment clause filings. The audit includes a review of the reasonableness of charges flowed through the fuel adjustment clause by Entergy Louisiana for the period from 2005 through 2009. Discovery is in progress, but a procedural schedule has not been established. 

In August 2000 the LPSC authorized its staff to initiate a proceeding to audit the fuel adjustment clause filings of Entergy Louisiana. The time period that is the subject of the audit was January 1, 2000 through December 31, 2001. The scope of this docket was expanded to include a review of annual reports on fuel and purchased power transactions with affiliates and a prudence review of transmission planning issues and to include the years 2002 through 2004. Hearings were held and in May 2008 the ALJ issued a final recommendation that found in Entergy Louisiana’s favor on the issues, except for the disallowance of hypothetical SO2 allowance costs included in affiliate purchase s. The ALJ recommended a refund of the SO2 allowance costs collected to date and a realignment of these costs into base rates prospectively with an amortization of the refunded amount through base rates over a five-year period. The LPSC issued an order in December 2008 affirming the ALJ’s recommendation. Entergy Louisiana recorded a provision for the disallowance, including interest, and refunded approximately $7 million to customers in 2009. 

Industrial and Commercial Customers 

Entergy Louisiana’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Louisiana’s industrial customer base. Entergy Louisiana responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Louisiana actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Louisiana does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because of the curren t economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Louisiana’s marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers. 

Federal Regulation 

See “System Agreement”, “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation regarding Reliability Standards”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Finan cial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. 

Nuclear Matters 

Entergy Louisiana owns and, through an affiliate, operates the Waterford 3 nuclear power plant. Entergy Louisiana is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Waterford 3, Entergy Louisiana may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regulatory requirements for decommissioning.

Entergy Louisiana, LLC 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The nuclear industry continues to address susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking of certain materials associated with components within the reactor coolant system. The issue is applicable to Waterford 3 and is managed in accordance with standard industry practices and guidelines. As discussed above in more detail, Entergy Louisiana plans to replace the Waterford 3 steam generators, along with the reactor vessel closure head and control element drive mechanisms. 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy Louisiana’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Louisiana is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Louisiana’s financial position or results of operations. 

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs 

See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Louisiana records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain c omponents of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for furth er discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Louisiana in 2010 was $14.6 million. Entergy Louisiana anticipates 2011 qualified pension cost to be $23.6 million. Entergy Louisiana contributed $66.1 million to its pension plans in 2010 and anticipates funding approximately $53 million in 2011 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Louisiana in 2010 were $17.8 million, including $3.1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Louisiana expects 2011 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $18.2 million, including $3.9 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Louisiana expects to contribute approximately $9.5 million to its other postretirement plans in 2011.

ENTERGY MISSISSIPPI, INC. 

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income increased $6.1 million primarily due to higher net revenue and higher other income, partially offset by higher taxes other than income taxes, higher depreciation and amortization expenses, and higher interest expense. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income increased $17.9 million primarily due to higher net revenue, partially offset by higher interest expense and higher depreciation and amortization expenses. 

Net Revenue 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 1,046 GWh, or 8%, in billed electricity usage in all sectors, primarily due to the effect of more favorable weather on the residential sector. 

Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges (credits) 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $22 million in power management rider revenue as the result of higher rates, the volume/weather variance discussed above, and an increase in Grand Gulf rider revenue as a result of higher rates and increased usage, offset by a decrease of $23.5 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in deferred fuel expense as a result of prior over-collections, offset by an increase in the average market price of purchased power coupled with increased net area demand. 

Other regulatory charges increased primarily due to increased recovery of costs associated with the power management recovery rider. There is no material effect on net income due to quarterly adjustments to the power management recovery rider.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2009 to 2008. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to a formula rate plan increase effective July 2009 and an increase in Attala power plant costs that are recovered through the power management rider. The formula rate plan filing is discussed further in “State and Local Rate Regulation” below. The net income effect of the Attala power plant costs recovery is limited to a portion representing an allowed return on equity with the remainder offset by Attala power plant costs in other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation expenses, and taxes other than income taxes. 

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to a change in a contract with a wholesale customer that increased its monthly demand charge and an increased net balance on joint account sales as a result of lower fuel prices in 2009. 

The reserve equalization variance is primarily due to increased reserve equalization revenue as a result of changes in the Entergy System generation mix compared to the same period in 2008. 

Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges (credits) 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease of $254.6 million in fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates and decreased usage and a decrease of $52.1 million in gross wholesale revenues primarily due to a decrease in volume as a result of less energy available for resale sales, partially offset by an increase of $20.4 million in power management rider revenue. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power. 

Other regulatory charges (credits) decreased primarily due to decreased recovery of costs associated with the power management recovery rider and decreased recovery through the Grand Gulf Rider of Grand Gulf capacity costs due to lower rates and decreased usage. There is no material effect on net income due to quarterly adjustments to the power management recovery rider and annual adjustments to the Grand Gulf rider. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of higher millage rates and a higher 2010 assessment as compared to 2009 and an increase in local franchise taxes as a result of higher revenues primarily in the residential and commercial sectors. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

315 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Other income increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for equity funds used during construction due to more construction work in progress in 2010, including the new nuclear development project that is discussed below. 

Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $150 million of 6.64% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2009. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Other income increased primarily due to the gain recorded in 2009 on the sale of utility property, offset by a potential buyer’s forfeiture of a $1.7 million deposit in June 2008 for an option to purchase non-utility property. 

Interest expense increased primarily due to the issuance of $150 million of 6.64% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2009. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2010, 2009, and 2008 were 37.0%, 35.3%, and 35.8%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $101.9 million in 2010 primarily due to decreased recovery of fuel costs primarily as a result of prior period over-collections and an increase of $27.7 million in pension contributions, offset by a decrease of $7.1 million in income tax payments. See Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of Entergy Mississippi’s fuel and purchased power cost recovery mechanism. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below for further discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits funding. 160; In 2010, Entergy Mississippi received federal tax cash refunds and made state tax cash payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The federal refunds result from the 2009 tax return filed in 2010 and the associated true up adjustment which relates primarily to the acceleration of deductions for plant-related expenditures. The state payments result from the allocation of the combined Mississippi tax reflected on the 2009 tax return filed in 2010 and for amended Mississippi returns for 2006-2008 filed in 2010. 

316 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $142 million in 2009 primarily due to increased recovery of deferred fuel costs and a decrease of $5.9 million in pension contributions, offset by an increase of $22.4 million in income tax payments. 

Investing Activities 

Cash flow used in investing activities increased $14.6 million in 2010 primarily due to increased construction expenditures resulting from a $49 million payment to a System Energy subsidiary for costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf, as discussed below, and increased transmission construction expenditures resulting from additional transmission reliability work in 2010, offset by money pool activity. 

Decreases in Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool decreased $31.4 million in 2010 compared to increasing by $31.4 million in 2009. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Cash flow used in investing activities increased $26.2 million in 2009 primarily due to money pool activity, offset by decreased construction expenditures related to various fossil and distribution projects. 

Increases in Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool increased by $31.4 million in 2009. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Financing Activities 

Entergy Mississippi’s financing activities used $36.2 million of cash in 2010 compared to providing $27.8 million of cash in 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    the redemption, prior to maturity, of $100 million of 7.25% Series first mortgage bonds in April 2010;    

  ·    the issuance of $150 million of 6.64% Series first mortgage bonds in June 2009; and    

  ·    the issuance of $80 million of 6.20% Series first mortgage bonds in April 2010; offset by    

  ·    money pool activity.    

Increases in Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Mississippi’s payable to the money pool increased by $33.3 million in 2010 compared to decreasing by $66 million in 2009.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Capital Structure 

Entergy Mississippi’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of capital lease obligations and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy Mississippi uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy Mississippi’s financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy Mississippi requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt and preferred stock maturities;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    dividend and interest payments.    

Following are the amounts of Entergy Mississippi’s planned construction and other capital investments, and existing debt obligations and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $121 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems, and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Mississippi, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Mississippi currently expects to contribute approximately $26.4 million to its pension plans and approximately $5.0 million to other postretirement plans in 2011; although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011.

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

 Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Mississippi has $10.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy Mississippi reflects capital required to support existing business and customer growth. Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, changes in project plans, and the abil ity to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Mississippi dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy Mississippi’s long-term debt indentures restrict the amount of retained earnings available for the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred stock. As of December 31, 2010, Entergy Mississippi had restricted retained earnings unavailable for distribution to Entergy Corporation of $240.8 million. 

New Nuclear Development 

Pursuant to the Mississippi Baseload Act and the Mississippi Public Utilities Act, Entergy Mississippi is developing a project option for new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf Nuclear Station. Entergy Mississippi, together with Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana, has been engaged in the development of options to construct new nuclear generation at the Grand Gulf and River Bend Station sites. Entergy Mississippi is leading the development at Grand Gulf, and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana are leading the development at River Bend. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In 2010, Entergy Mi ssissippi paid for and has recognized on its books $49 million in costs associated with the development of new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf; these costs previously had been recorded on the books of Entergy New Nuclear Utility Development, LLC, a System Energy subsidiary. In October 2010, Entergy Mississippi filed an application with the MPSC requesting that the MPSC determine that it is in the public interest to preserve the option to construct new nuclear generation at Grand Gulf and that the MPSC approve the deferral of Entergy Mississippi’s costs incurred to date and in the future related to this project, including the accrual of AFUDC or similar carrying charges. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Mississippi’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred stock issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

Entergy Mississippi may refinance or redeem debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Mississippi require prior regulatory approval. Preferred stock and debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its corporate charter, bond indenture, and other agreements. Entergy Mississippi has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In May 2010, Entergy Mississippi renewed its three separate credit facilities through May 2011 in the aggregate amount of $70 million. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit facilities as of December 31, 2010. 

Entergy Mississippi’s receivables from (or payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In May 2007, $6.6 million of Entergy Mississippi’s receivable from the money pool was replaced by a note receivable from Entergy New Orleans. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

 Entergy Mississippi has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $175 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Mississippi’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Mississippi has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2011. 

State and Local Rate Regulation 

The rates that Entergy Mississippi charges for electricity significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Mississippi is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the MPSC, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

Formula Rate Plan 

In September 2009, Entergy Mississippi filed with the MPSC proposed modifications to its formula rate plan rider. In March 2010 the MPSC issued an order: (1) providing the opportunity for a reset of Entergy Mississippi's return on common equity to a point within the formula rate plan bandwidth and eliminating the 50/50 sharing that had been in the plan, (2) modifying the performance measurement process, and (3) replacing the revenue change limit of two percent of revenues, which was subject to a $14.5 million revenue adjustment cap, with a limit of four percent of revenues, although any adjustment above two percent requires a hearing before the MPSC. The MPSC did not approve Entergy Mississippi's request to use a projected test year for its annua l scheduled formula rate plan filing and, therefore, Entergy Mississippi will continue to use a historical test year for its annual evaluation reports under the plan. 

In March 2010, Entergy Mississippi submitted its 2009 test year filing, its first annual filing under the new formula rate plan rider. In June 2010 the MPSC approved a joint stipulation between Entergy Mississippi and the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff that provides for no change in rates, but does provide for the deferral as a regulatory asset of $3.9 million of legal expenses associated with certain litigation involving the Mississippi Attorney General, as well as ongoing legal expenses in that litigation until the litigation is resolved. 

In March 2009, Entergy Mississippi made with the MPSC its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing for the 2008 test year. The filing reported a $27.0 million revenue deficiency and an earned return on common equity of 7.41%. Entergy Mississippi requested a $14.5 million increase in annual electric revenues, which is the maximum increase allowed under the terms of the formula rate plan. The MPSC issued an order on June 30, 2009, finding that Entergy Mississippi’s earned return was sufficiently below the lower bandwidth limit set by the formula rate plan to require a $14.5 million increase in annual revenues, effective for bills rendered on or after June 30, 2009.

Table of Contents 

Entergy Mississippi, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In March 2008, Entergy Mississippi made its annual scheduled formula rate plan filing for the 2007 test year with the MPSC. The filing showed that a $10.1 million increase in annual electric revenues is warranted. In June 2008, Entergy Mississippi reached a settlement with the Mississippi Public Utilities Staff that would result in a $3.8 million rate increase. In January 2009 the MPSC rejected the settlement and left the current rates in effect. Entergy Mississippi appealed the MPSC’s decision to the Mississippi Supreme Court. After the decision of the MPSC regarding the formula rate plan filing for the 2008 test year, Entergy Mississippi filed a motion to dismiss its appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court. 

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery 

Entergy Mississippi’s rate schedules include an energy cost recovery rider that is adjusted quarterly to reflect accumulated over- or under-recoveries from the second prior quarter. Entergy Mississippi’s fuel cost recoveries are subject to annual audits conducted pursuant to the authority of the MPSC. 

In October 2008 the MPSC issued an order directing Entergy Mississippi and Entergy Services to provide documents associated with fuel adjustment clause litigation in Louisiana involving Entergy Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans, and in January 2009 issued an order requiring Entergy Mississippi to provide additional information related to the long-term Evangeline gas contract that had been an issue in the fuel adjustment clause litigation in Louisiana. Entergy Mississippi and Entergy Services filed a response to the MPSC order stating that gas from the Evangeline gas contract had been sold into the Entergy System exchange and had an effect on the costs paid by Entergy Mississippi’s customers. Further proceedings have not been scheduled. 

In August 2009 the MPSC retained an independent audit firm to audit Entergy Mississippi's fuel adjustment clause submittals for the period October 2007 through September 2009. The independent audit firm submitted its report to the MPSC in December 2009. The report does not recommend that any costs be disallowed for recovery. The report did suggest that some costs, less than one percent of the fuel and purchased power costs recovered during the period, may have been more reasonably charged to customers through base rates rather than through fuel charges, but the report did not suggest that customers should not have paid for those costs. In November 2009 the MPSC also retained another firm to review processes and practices related to fuel and pur chased energy. The results of that review were filed with the MPSC in March 2010. In that report, the independent consulting firm found that the practices and procedures in activities that directly affect the costs recovered through Entergy Mississippi's fuel adjustment clause appear reasonable. Both audit reports were certified by the MPSC to the Mississippi Legislature, as required by Mississippi law. 

Mississippi Attorney General Complaint 

The Mississippi attorney general filed a complaint in state court in December 2008 against Entergy Corporation, Entergy Mississippi, Entergy Services, and Entergy Power alleging, among other things, violations of Mississippi statutes, fraud, and breach of good faith and fair dealing, and requesting an accounting and restitution. The litigation is wide ranging and relates to tariffs and procedures under which Entergy Mississippi purchases power not generated in Mississippi to meet electricity demand. Entergy believes the complaint is unfounded. On December 29, 2008, the defendant Entergy companies filed to remove the attorney general’s suit to U.S. District Court (the forum that Entergy believes is appropriate to resolve the types of federal issues r aised in the suit), where it is currently pending, and additionally answered the complaint and filed a counter-claim for relief based upon the Mississippi Public Utilities Act and the Federal Power Act. The Mississippi attorney general has filed a pleading seeking to remand the matter to state court. In May 2009, the defendant Entergy companies filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings asserting grounds of federal preemption, the exclusive jurisdiction of the MPSC, and factual errors in the attorney general’s complaint.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy Mississippi’s financial position or results of operations. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Mississippi records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for furth er discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. 

Cost Sensitivity 

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands):

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. 

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Mississippi in 2010 was $7.3 million. Entergy Mississippi anticipates 2011 qualified pension cost to be $7.7 million. Entergy Mississippi contributed $33.5 million to its qualified pension plans in 2010 and anticipates that it will contribute approximately $26.4 million in 2011 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Mississippi in 2010 were $5.0 million, including $1.6 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Mississippi expects 2011 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $5.5 million, including $2.0 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Mississippi expects to contribute approximately $5 million to its other postretirement plans in 2011.

ENTERGY NEW ORLEANS, INC. 

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income remained relatively unchanged, decreasing $0.02 million, primarily due to higher other operation and maintenance expenses, higher taxes other than income taxes, lower other income, and higher depreciation and amortization expenses, almost entirely offset by higher net revenue and lower interest expense. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income decreased $3.9 million primarily due to lower net revenue and lower other income, partially offset by lower interest expense and a lower effective income tax rate. 

Net Revenue 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges (credits). Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase of 348 GWh, or 7%, in billed retail electricity usage primarily due to more favorable weather compared to last year. 

The net gas revenue variance is primarily due to more favorable weather compared to last year, along with the recognition of a gas regulatory asset associated with the settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s electric and gas formula rate plans. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the formula rate plan settlement. 

The effect of 2009 rate case settlement variance results from the April 2009 settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s rate case, and includes the effects of realigning non-fuel costs associated with the operation of Grand Gulf from the fuel adjustment clause to electric base rates effective June 2009. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2009 to 2008. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The effect of rate case settlement variance results from the April 2009 settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s rate case, and includes the effects of realigning non-fuel costs associated with the operation of Grand Gulf from the fuel adjustment clause to electric base rates effective June 2009. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. 

The price applied to unbilled sales variance results from a decline in natural gas and purchased power prices. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to an increase in electricity usage in the service territory, and more favorable weather in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008. Entergy New Orleans estimates that approximately 150,000 electric customers and 96,000 gas customers have returned since Hurricane Katrina and are taking service as of December 31, 2009, compared to approximately 141,000 electric customers and 93,000 gas customers as of December 31, 2008. Billed retail electricity usage increased a total of 238 GWh compared to the same period in 2008, an increase of 5.3%. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to: 

  ·    a decrease of $107.5 million in electric fuel cost recovery revenues due to lower fuel rates offset by higher electricity usage;    

  ·    a decrease of $74.8 million in gross wholesale revenue due to a decrease in the average price of energy available for resale sales; and    

  ·    a decrease of $37 million in gross gas revenues primarily due to lower fuel cost recovery revenues.    

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power, partially offset by an increase in demand. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $15.1 million in fossil expenses due to higher outage expenses compared to prior year;    

  ·    an increase of $2.2 million in distribution expenses primarily due to increases in vegetation maintenance, overhead and underground inspections, and substation maintenance and repairs;    

  ·    an increase of $1.9 million in compensation and benefits costs, resulting from decreasing discount rates, the amortization of benefit trust asset losses, and an increase in the accrual for incentive-based compensation. See Note 11 to the financial statements for further discussion of benefits costs; and    

  ·    an increase of $1.9 million primarily due to higher transmission equalization expenses in 2010.    

333 

Table of Contents 

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of higher millage rates and an increase in local franchise taxes resulting from higher electric and gas retail revenues as compared with the same period in 2009. 

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to an increase in plant in service. 

Other income decreased primarily due to carrying costs on Hurricane Gustav and Hurricane Ike storm restoration costs recorded in 2009. 

Interest expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate on notes payable issued to affiliates as part of Entergy New Orleans’s plan of reorganization, in addition to the repayment of those notes in May 2010 and the repayment, at maturity, of $30 million of 4.98% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2010. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Other income decreased primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate earned on money pool investments. 

Interest and other charges decreased primarily due to a decrease in the interest rate on notes payable issued to affiliates as part of Entergy New Orleans’s plan of reorganization. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2010, 2009, and 2008 were 34.8%, 33.6%, and 39.7%, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rate. 

Hurricane Katrina 

In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused catastrophic damage to Entergy New Orleans’s service territory, including the effect of extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in and around the New Orleans area. The storms and flooding resulted in power outages; significant damage to electric distribution, transmission, and generation and gas infrastructure; and the loss of sales and customers due to mandatory evacuations and the destruction of homes and businesses. Entergy pursued a broad range of initiatives to recover storm restoration and business continuity costs. Initiatives included obtaining reimbursement of certain costs covered by insurance, obtaining assistance through federal legislation for damage caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Ri ta, and pursuing recovery through existing or new rate mechanisms regulated by the FERC and the City Council. Entergy New Orleans substantially completed its insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina in 2009. 

Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) 

In December 2005, the U.S. Congress passed the Katrina Relief Bill, a hurricane aid package that included CDBG funding that allowed state and local leaders to fund individual recovery priorities. In March 2007, the City Council certified that Entergy New Orleans incurred $205 million in storm-related costs through December 2006 that are eligible for CDBG funding under the state action plan, and certified Entergy New Orleans’s estimated costs of $465 million for its gas system rebuild (which is discussed below). Entergy New Orleans received $180.8 million of CDBG funds in 2007 and $19.2 million in 2010. 

Rate and Storm-related Riders Filings 

See “Formula Rate Plans and Storm-related Riders” below for a discussion of Entergy New Orleans’s June 2006 formula rate plan filings and request to implement two storm-related riders filed with the City Council.

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Gas System Rebuild 

In addition to the Hurricane Katrina storm restoration costs that Entergy New Orleans incurred, Entergy New Orleans expects that over a longer term rebuilding of the gas system in New Orleans will be necessary due to the massive salt water intrusion into the system caused by the flooding in New Orleans. The salt water intrusion is expected to shorten the life of the gas system, making it necessary to rebuild portions of that system over time, earlier than otherwise would be expected, with the project extending many years into the future. Entergy New Orleans received insurance proceeds for a portion of the estimated future construction expenditures associated with rebuilding its gas system, and the October 2006 City Council resolution approving the settlement of Entergy New Orleans’s rate and storm-cost reco very filings requires Entergy New Orleans to record those proceeds in a designated sub-account of other deferred credits until the proceeds are spent on the rebuild project. This other deferred credit is shown as “Gas system rebuild insurance proceeds” on Entergy New Orleans’s balance sheet. 

Bankruptcy Proceedings 

As a result of the effects of Hurricane Katrina and the effect of extensive flooding that resulted from levee breaks in and around the New Orleans area, on September 23, 2005, Entergy New Orleans filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy court seeking reorganization relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On May 7, 2007, the bankruptcy judge entered an order confirming Entergy New Orleans’s plan of reorganization. With the receipt of CDBG funds, and the agreement on insurance recovery with one of its excess insurers, Entergy New Orleans waived the conditions precedent in its plan of reorganization, and the plan became effective on May 8, 2007. Included in the terms in the plan of reorganization Entergy New Orleans issued notes to affilia tes. Entergy New Orleans repaid, at maturity in May 2010, these notes that represented affiliate prepetition accounts payable (approximately $74 million, including interest), including its indebtedness to the Entergy System money pool. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Operating Activities 

Net cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $99.6 million in 2010 primarily due to income tax payments of $68.2 million made in 2010 compared to refunds of $22.1 million received in 2009 and an increase in pension contributions of $11.9 million. In 2010, Entergy New Orleans made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The payments result from the reversal of temporary differences for which Entergy New Orleans previously received cash tax benefits and from estimated federal income tax payments for tax year 2010. See “MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of quali fied pension and other postretirement benefits. The decrease was partially offset by the receipt of $19.2 million of Community Development Block Grant funds, as discussed above.

Table of Contents 

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $61.4 million in 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    the timing of collection of receivables from customers;    

  ·    income tax refunds of $22.1 million in 2009 compared to income tax payments of $5.8 million in 2008; and    

  ·    increased recovery of deferred fuel costs.    

The increase was partially offset by the timing of payments to vendors. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $28.3 million in 2010 primarily due to money pool activity and a withdrawal from the storm escrow account that was related to Hurricane Gustav costs, partially offset by: 

  ·    higher fossil construction expenses primarily due to current year outages and the Michoud 3 generator rewind project;    

  ·    higher distribution construction expenditures primarily due to increased reliability work; and    

  ·    a decrease in Hurricane Katrina insurance proceeds received in 2010 as compared to 2009.    

 Decreases in Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool are a sources of cash flow, and Entergy New Orleans’s receivable from the money pool decreased $44.3 million in 2010 compared to increasing $6.1 million in 2009. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Net cash used in investing activities increased $50.1 million in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in Hurricane Katrina insurance proceeds received in 2009 as compared to 2008, partially offset by storm restoration spending in 2008 related to Hurricane Gustav. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash flow used in financing activities increased $118.6 million in 2010 primarily due to: 

  ·    the repayment of $74.3 million of affiliate notes payable in May 2010;    

  ·    the repayment, at maturity, of $30 million of 4.98% Series first mortgage bonds in July 2010;    

  ·    the repayment of $25 million of 6.75% Series first mortgage bonds in December 2010; and    

  ·    an increase of $14.1 million in dividends paid on common stock.    

The increase was partially offset by the issuance of $25 million of 5.10% Series first mortgage bonds in November 2010. 

Net cash used in financing activities increased $3.0 million primarily due to $32.9 million of dividends paid on common stock in 2009, partially offset by the redemption, at maturity, of $30 million of 3.875% Series First Mortgage Bonds in August 2008. 

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details on long-term debt.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Capital Structure 

Entergy New Orleans’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt as shown in the following table. The decrease in the debt to capital ratio is primarily due to the repayment of affiliate notes payable in May 2010 and the repayment of first mortgage bonds in July 2010. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of notes payable and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. Entergy New Orleans uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating Entergy New Orleans’s financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

Entergy New Orleans requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel and purchased power costs; and    

  ·    dividend payments.    

Following are the amounts of Entergy New Orleans’s planned construction and other capital investments and existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $35 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth. Also includes spending for the long-term gas rebuild project.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy New Orleans, almost all of the total consists of unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations, including its obligations under the Unit Power Sales Agreement, which is discussed in Note 8 to the financial statements.    

Entergy New Orleans expects to contribute approximately $10.6 million to its pension plan and approximately $5.2 million to its other postretirement plans in 2011 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011.

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy New Orleans has $13.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

The planned capital investment estimate for Entergy New Orleans reflects capital required to support existing business. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more information on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 and to the financial statements. 

As an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, Entergy New Orleans pays dividends from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. Entergy New Orleans’s long-term debt indentures contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends or other distributions on its common and preferred stock. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy New Orleans’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand; and    

  ·    debt and preferred stock issuances.    

Entergy New Orleans may refinance or redeem debt and preferred stock prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

Entergy New Orleans’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

Pursuant to its plan of reorganization, in May 2007, Entergy New Orleans issued notes due in three years in satisfaction of its affiliate prepetition accounts payable (approximately $74 million, including interest), including its indebtedness to the Entergy System money pool. In May 2010, Entergy New Orleans repaid, at maturity, the notes payable. 

Entergy New Orleans has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $100 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy New Orleans’s short-term borrowing limits. The long-term securities issuances of Entergy New Orleans are limited to amounts authorized by the City Council, and the current authorization extends through July 2012. 

State and Local Rate Regulation 

The rates that Entergy New Orleans charges for electricity and natural gas significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy New Orleans is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. A governmental agency, the City Council, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers.

Rate Cases, Formula Rate Plans and Storm-related Riders 

On July 31, 2008, Entergy New Orleans filed an electric and gas base rate case with the City Council. On April 2, 2009, the City Council approved a comprehensive settlement. The settlement provided for a net $35.3 million reduction in combined fuel and non-fuel electric revenue requirement, including conversion of a $10.6 million voluntary recovery credit, implemented in January 2008, to a permanent reduction and substantial realignment of Grand Gulf cost recovery from fuel to electric base rates, and a $4.95 million gas base rate increase, both effective June 1, 2009, with adjustment of the customer charges for all rate classes. A new three-year formula rate plan was also adopted, with terms including an 11.1% benchmark electric return on common equity ( ROE) with a +/- 40 basis point bandwidth and a 10.75% benchmark gas ROE with a +/- 50 basis point bandwidth. Earnings outside the bandwidth reset to the midpoint benchmark ROE, with rates changing on a prospective basis depending on whether Entergy New Orleans is over- or under-earning. The formula rate plan also includes a recovery mechanism for City Council-approved capacity additions, plus provisions for extraordinary cost changes and force majeure events. 

In May 2010, Entergy New Orleans filed its electric and gas formula rate plan evaluation reports. The filings requested a $12.8 million electric base revenue decrease and a $2.4 million gas base revenue increase. Entergy New Orleans and the City Council's Advisors reached a settlement that resulted in an $18.0 million electric base revenue decrease and zero gas base revenue change effective with the October 2010 billing cycle. The City Council approved the settlement in November 2010. 

The 2008 rate case settlement also included $3.1 million per year in electric rates to fund the Energy Smart energy efficiency programs. In September 2009 the City Council approved the energy efficiency programs filed by Entergy New Orleans. The rate settlement provides an incentive for Entergy New Orleans to meet or exceed energy savings targets set by the City Council and provides a mechanism for Entergy New Orleans to recover lost contribution to fixed costs associated with the energy savings generated from the energy efficiency programs. 

In June 2006, Entergy New Orleans made its annual formula rate plan filings with the City Council. The filings presented various alternatives to reflect the effect of Entergy New Orleans’s lost customers and decreased revenue following Hurricane Katrina. The alternative that Entergy New Orleans recommended adjusts for lost customers and assumes that the City Council’s June 2006 decision to allow recovery of all Grand Gulf costs through the fuel adjustment clause stays in place during the rate-effective period (a significant portion of Grand Gulf costs was previously recovered through base rates). 

At the same time as it made its formula rate plan filings, Entergy New Orleans also filed with the City Council a request to implement two storm-related riders. With the first rider, Entergy New Orleans sought to recover the electric and gas restoration costs that it had actually spent through March 31, 2006. Entergy New Orleans also proposed semiannual filings to update the rider for additional restoration spending and also to consider the receipt of CDBG funds or insurance proceeds that it may receive. With the second rider, Entergy New Orleans sought to establish a storm reserve to provide for the risk of another storm. 

In October 2006, the City Council approved a settlement agreement that resolved Entergy New Orleans’s rate and storm-related rider filings by providing for phased-in rate increases, while taking into account with respect to storm restoration costs the anticipated receipt of CDBG funding as recommended by the Louisiana Recovery Authority. The settlement provided for a 0% increase in electric base rates through December 2007, with a $3.9 million increase implemented in January 2008. Recovery of all Grand Gulf costs through the fuel adjustment clause was continued. Gas base rates increased by $4.75 million in November 2006 and increased by an additional $1.5 million in March 2007 and an additional $4.75 million in November 2007. The settleme nt called for Entergy New Orleans to file a base rate case by July 31, 2008, which it did as discussed above. The settlement agreement discontinued the formula rate plan and the generation performance-based plan but permitted Entergy New Orleans to file an application to seek authority to implement formula rate plan mechanisms no sooner than six months following the effective date of the implementation of the base rates resulting from the July 31, 2008 base rate case. The settlement also authorized a $75 million storm reserve for damage from future storms, which will be created over a ten-year period through a storm reserve rider beginning in March 2007. These storm reserve funds will be held in a restricted escrow account.

Entergy New Orleans, Inc. 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In addition to rate proceedings, Entergy New Orleans’s fuel costs recovered from customers are subject to regulatory scrutiny. Entergy New Orleans’s electric rate schedules include a fuel adjustment tariff designed to reflect no more than targeted fuel and purchased power costs, adjusted by a surcharge or credit for deferred fuel expense arising from the monthly reconciliation of actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred with fuel cost revenues billed to customers, including carrying charges. In June 2006 the City Council authorized the recovery of all Grand Gulf costs through Entergy New Orleans’s fuel adjustment clause (a significant portion of Grand Gulf costs was previously recovered through base rates), and continued that authorization in approving the October 2006 formula rate plan filing settlement. Effective June 2009, the majority of Grand Gulf costs were realigned to base rates and are no longer flowed through the fuel adjustment clause. 

Entergy New Orleans’s gas rate schedules include a purchased gas adjustment to reflect estimated gas costs for the billing month, adjusted by a surcharge or credit similar to that included in the electric fuel adjustment clause, including carrying charges. In October 2005, the City Council approved modification of the gas cost collection mechanism effective November 2005 in order to address concerns regarding its fluctuations, particularly during the winter heating season. The modifications are intended to minimize fluctuations in gas rates during the winter months. 

Federal Regulation 

See “System Agreement”, “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation regarding Reliability Standards”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Fi nancial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy New Orleans’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy New Orleans is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of Entergy New Orleans’s financial position or results of operations. 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy New Orleans records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month, including fuel price. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period and fuel pri ce fluctuations, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. Effective June 2009, Entergy New Orleans reclassified the fuel component of unbilled accounts receivable to deferred fuel and will no longer include the fuel component in the unbilled calculation, which is in accordance with regulatory treatment.

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for furth er discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. 

Cost Sensitivity 

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands):

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of postretirement benefit cost to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. 

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy New Orleans in 2010 was $3.6 million. Entergy New Orleans anticipates 2011 qualified pension cost to be $5.5 million. Entergy New Orleans contributed $13 million in qualified pension contributions in 2010 and anticipates approximately a $10.6 million pension contribution in 2011 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011valuations are completed by April 1, 2011. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy New Orleans in 2010 were $5.2 million, including $1.1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy New Orleans expects 2011 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $3.7 million, including $1.2 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy New Orleans expects to contribute approximately $5.2 million to its other postretirement plans in 2011.

ENTERGY TEXAS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income increased by $2.4 million primarily due to higher net revenue and lower interest expense, partially offset by lower other income, higher taxes other than income taxes, and higher other operation and maintenance expenses. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income increased by $5.9 million primarily due to higher net revenue and higher other income, partially offset by higher other operation and maintenance expenses and higher interest and other charges. 

Net Revenue 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2010 to 2009. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to increased sales to municipal and co-op customers due to the addition of new contracts. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to increased electricity usage primarily in the residential and commercial sectors, resulting from a 1.5% increase in customers, coupled with the effect of more favorable weather on residential sales. Billed electricity usage increased a total of 777 GWh, or 5%. 

The rough production cost equalization variance is due to an additional $18.6 million allocation recorded in the second quarter of 2009 for 2007 rough production cost equalization receipts ordered by the PUCT to Texas retail customers over what was originally allocated to Entergy Texas prior to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 2007, as discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. 

350 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to rate actions, including an annual base rate increase of $59 million beginning August 2010 as a result of the settlement of the December 2009 rate case. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. 

The securitization transition charge variance is due to the issuance of securitization bonds. In November 2009, Entergy Texas Restoration Funding, LLC, a company wholly-owned and consolidated by Entergy Texas, issued securitization bonds and with the proceeds purchased from Entergy Texas the transition property, which is the right to recover from customers through a transition charge amounts sufficient to service the securitization bonds. The securitization transition charge is offset with a corresponding increase in interest on long-term debt with no impact on net income. See Note 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of the securitization bond issuance. 

The purchased power capacity variance is primarily due to price increases in ongoing purchased power capacity expense and additional capacity purchases. 

Gross operating revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses 

Gross operating revenues increased primarily due to an increase of $145.6 million in gross wholesale revenues as a result of the addition of new customer contracts and the increase related to volume/weather, as discussed above. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of $59.9 million in fuel cost recovery revenues primarily attributable to lower fuel rates and interim fuel refunds in the first quarter 2010 and the third and fourth quarters 2010. The interim fuel refunds and the PUCT approvals are discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses increased primarily due to increases in the average market prices of purchased power and natural gas, substantially offset by a decrease in deferred fuel expenses as the result of lower fuel revenues, as discussed above. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net revenue consists of operating revenues net of: 1) fuel, fuel-related expenses, and gas purchased for resale, 2) purchased power expenses, and 3) other regulatory charges. Following is an analysis of the change in net revenue comparing 2009 to 2008. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The retail electric price variance is primarily due to rate increases effective late-January 2009 and an Energy Efficiency rider which became effective December 31, 2008, which is substantially offset in other operation and maintenance expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate increases. 

The volume/weather variance is primarily due to the effect of more favorable weather on billed and unbilled sales in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008 and an increase in unbilled sales volume, including the effects of Hurricane Ike which decreased sales volume in 2008. 

351 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The net wholesale revenue variance is primarily due to higher capacity revenue as a result of the purchased power agreements between Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas and increased volume to municipal and co-op customers. 

As discussed further in Note 2 to the financial statements, the rough production cost equalization variance is due to an additional $18.6 million allocation of 2007 rough production cost equalization receipts ordered by the PUCT to Texas retail customers over what was originally allocated to Entergy Texas prior to the jurisdictional separation of Entergy Gulf States, Inc. into Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas, effective December 2007. 

The reserve equalization variance is primarily due to increased reserve equalization expense related to changes in the Entergy System generation mix compared to the same period in 2008. 

Gross operating revenues, fuel and purchased power expenses, and other regulatory charges 

Gross operating revenues decreased primarily due to a decrease of $285.3 million in fuel cost recovery revenues primarily attributable to lower fuel rates and a decrease in affiliated wholesale revenue of $141.8 million due to a decrease in the average price of energy available for resale sales. 

Fuel and purchased power expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in the average market prices of natural gas and purchased power, partially offset by an increase in deferred fuel expense due to fuel and purchased power expense decreases in excess of lower fuel cost recovery revenues. 

Other regulatory charges increased primarily due to rough production cost equalization charges as described above. 

Other Income Statement Variances 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to the amortization of $11 million of rate case expenses. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of the rate case settlement. The increase was partially offset by a charge of $6.8 million in June 2009 resulting from the Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav storm cost recovery settlement with the PUCT. See Note 2 to the financial statements for discussion of this settlement. 

Taxes other than income taxes increased primarily due to a provision recorded for sales and use taxes, an increase in local franchise taxes, and an increase in ad valorem taxes as a result of a higher 2010 assessment as compared to 2009, partially offset by lower millage rates. 

Other income decreased primarily due to carrying costs recorded in 2009 on storm restoration costs as approved by Texas legislation. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery filings. 

Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower interest on deferred fuel costs and the pay-down of the debt assumption agreement liability. The decrease was partially offset by the issuance of $546 million in securitization bonds in November 2009. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to: 

  ·    an increase of $11.4 million in fossil expenses primarily due to higher plant maintenance costs and plant outages;    

  ·    an increase of $6.8 million due to the Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav storm cost recovery settlement agreement, as discussed below under “Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav”;    

352 

Table of Contents 

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

  ·    an increase of $1.8 million in transmission spending primarily for costs related to the Independent Coordinator of Transmission and substation maintenance;    

  ·    an increase of $1.8 million in local easement fees as the result of higher gross revenues in certain locations within the Texas jurisdiction; and    

  ·    an increase of $1.7 million in customer service costs primarily as a result of write-offs of uncollectible customer accounts.    

Other income increased primarily due to carrying charges on Hurricane Ike storm restoration costs as authorized by Texas legislation in the second quarter 2009, partially offset by a decrease in taxes collected on advances for transmission projects and a decrease in interest earned on money pool investments. See Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of Hurricane Ike storm cost recovery filings. 

Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in long-term debt outstanding as a result of the issuance of $500 million of 7.125% Series mortgage bonds in January 2009 and the issuance of $150 million of 7.875% Series mortgage bonds in May 2009, partially offset by pay-down of debt assumption agreement liabilities. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates were 39.0%, 36.6%, and 32.7% for 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35% to the effective income tax rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were as follows:

Operating Activities 

Cash flow provided by operating activities decreased $244.4 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    the timing of collection of receivables from customers;    

  ·    income tax payments of $48.7 million in 2010 compared to income tax refunds of $72.3 million in 2009. In 2010, Entergy Texas made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The tax payments result from differences between Entergy Texas’s estimated utilization of net operating losses and actual utilization on the 2009 tax return filed in 2010;    

  ·    an $87.8 million fuel cost refund made in the first quarter 2010 and an $77 million fuel cost refund made in the third and fourth quarters 2010; and    

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

The decrease was partially offset by the absence in 2010 of Hurricane Ike restoration spending that occurred in 2009.

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased $286.1 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to: 

  ·    the timing of collection of receivables from customers;    

  ·    increased recovery of deferred fuel costs. The increased fuel recovery was primarily caused by the $71 million fuel cost over-recovery refund in 2008 that is discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, in addition to the over-recovery of fuel costs in 2009 compared to 2008;    

  ·    income tax refunds of $72.3 million in 2009 compared to income tax payments of $762 thousand in 2008; and    

  ·    a decrease of $15.3 million in pension contributions.    

The increase was partially offset by Hurricane Ike restoration spending in 2008. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash flow used in investing activities decreased $95.2 million in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to money pool activity and a decrease in construction expenditures due to Hurricane Ike spending in 2009, offset by a decrease of $31.5 million in insurance proceeds and increased remittances to the securitization trust account as a result of the issuance of $546 million in securitization bonds in November 2009. See Note 5 to the financial statements for further discussion of the issuance of the securitization bonds. 

Decreases in Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool are a source of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool decreased by $55.6 million in 2010 compared to increasing by $69.3 million in 2009. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Cash flow used in investing activities increased $99.8 million in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to money pool activity, partially offset by higher construction expenditures in 2008 due to Hurricane Ike and insurance proceeds received in 2009 relating to Hurricane Ike. 

Increases in Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s receivable from the money pool increased by $69.3 million in 2009 compared to decreasing by $154.2 million in 2008. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Financing Activities 

Entergy Texas’s financing activities used $87 million of cash in 2010 compared to providing $127.6 million of cash in 2009 primarily due to: 

  ·    the issuance of $545.9 million of securitization bonds in November 2009. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds;    

  ·    the issuance of $500 million of 7.125% Series mortgage bonds in January 2009;    

  ·    the issuance of $150 million of 7.875% Series mortgage bonds in May 2009;    

  ·    the issuance of $200 million of 3.60% Series mortgage bonds in May 2010; and    

  ·    the retirement of $199.1 million of long-term debt in 2010 compared to $619.9 million in 2009.    

The use of cash was partially offset by: 

  ·    the repayment of Entergy Texas’s $160 million note payable to Entergy Corporation in January 2009;    

  ·    the repayment of $100 million outstanding on Entergy Texas’s credit facility in February 2009;    

  ·    money pool activity; and    

  ·    a decrease of $33.1 million in common equity distributions.    

Decreases in Entergy Texas’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s payable to the money pool decreased by $50.8 million in 2009.

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Financing activities provided cash of $127.6 million for 2009 compared to using cash of $179.4 million for 2008 primarily due to: 

  ·    the issuance of $545.9 million of securitization bonds in November 2009. See Note 5 to the financial statements for additional information regarding the securitization bonds;    

  ·    the issuance of $500 million of 7.125% Series Mortgage Bonds in January 2009;    

  ·    the issuance of $150 million of 7.875% Series Mortgage Bonds in May 2009; and    

  ·    $150 million of capital returned to Entergy Corporation in February 2008. After the effects of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, Entergy Corporation made a $300 million capital contribution to Entergy Gulf States, Inc. in 2005, which was part of Entergy’s financing plan that provided liquidity and capital resources to Entergy and its subsidiaries while storm restoration cost recovery was pursued.    

The cash provided was partially offset by: 

  ·    the retirement of $619.9 million of long term debt in 2009 compared to $327.5 million in 2008;    

  ·    the repayment of $100 million outstanding on Entergy Texas’s credit facility in February 2009 as compared to borrowings of $100 million on Entergy Texas’s credit facility in 2008;    

  ·    the repayment of Entergy Texas’s $160 million note payable from Entergy Corporation in January 2009;    

  ·    an increase of $107.5 million in common stock dividends paid; and    

  ·    money pool activity.    

Decreases in Entergy Texas’s payable to the money pool are a use of cash flow, and Entergy Texas’s payable to the money pool decreased by $50.8 million in 2009 compared to increasing by $50.8 million in 2008. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce Entergy’s subsidiaries need for external short-term borrowings.

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Following are the amounts of Entergy Texas’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $107 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For Entergy Texas, it primarily includes unconditional fuel and purchased power obligations.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, Entergy Texas expects to contribute approximately $15.9 million to its pension plans and approximately $5.2 million to other postretirement plans in 2011 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011. 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, Entergy Texas has $6.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. 

Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. The estimated capital expenditures are subject to periodic review and modification and may vary based on the ongoing effects of regulatory constraints, environmental compliance, market volatility, economic trends, business restructuring, changes in project plans, and the ability to access capital. Management provides more informati on on long-term debt and preferred stock maturities in Notes 5 and 6 to the financial statements. 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, Entergy Texas pays dividends to Entergy Corporation from its earnings at a percentage determined monthly. 

Sources of Capital 

Entergy Texas’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt or preferred stock issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

Entergy Texas may refinance or redeem debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable.

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

All debt and common and preferred stock issuances by Entergy Texas require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. Entergy Texas has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

Entergy Texas’s receivables from or (payables to) the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool. 

Entergy Texas has a credit facility in the amount of $100 million scheduled to expire in August 2012. No borrowings were outstanding under the facility as of December 31, 2010. 

Entergy Texas has obtained short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $200 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of Entergy Texas’s short-term borrowing limits. Entergy Texas has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances through July 2011. 

Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav 

In September 2008, Hurricane Ike caused catastrophic damage to Entergy Texas’s service territory. The storm resulted in widespread power outages, significant damage to distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure, and the loss of sales during the power outages. Entergy Texas filed an application in April 2009 seeking a determination that $577.5 million of Hurricane Ike and Hurricane Gustav restoration costs are recoverable, including estimated costs for work to be completed. On August 5, 2009, Entergy Texas submitted to the ALJ an unopposed settlement agreement intended to resolve all issues in the storm cost recovery case. Under the terms of the agreement $566.4 million, plus carrying costs, are eligible for recovery. & #160;Insurance proceeds will be credited as an offset to the securitized amount. Of the $11.1 million difference between Entergy Texas’s request and the amount agreed to, which is part of the black box agreement and not directly attributable to any specific individual issues raised, $6.8 million is operation and maintenance expense for which Entergy Texas recorded a charge in the second quarter 2009. The remaining $4.3 million was recorded as utility plant. The PUCT approved the settlement in August 2009, and in September 2009 the PUCT approved recovery of the costs, plus carrying costs, by securitization. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the November 2009 issuance of the securitization bonds. 

In the third quarter 2009, Entergy settled with its insurer on its Hurricane Ike claim and Entergy Texas received $75.5 million in proceeds (Entergy received a total of $76.5 million). 

Hurricane Rita 

In September 2005, Hurricane Rita hit Entergy Texas’s service territory. The storm resulted in power outages; significant damage to electric distribution, transmission, and generation infrastructure; and the temporary loss of sales and customers due to mandatory evacuations. In July 2006, Entergy Texas filed an application with the PUCT with respect to its Hurricane Rita reconstruction costs incurred through March 2006. The filing asked the PUCT to determine the amount of reasonable and necessary hurricane reconstruction costs eligible for securitization and recovery, approve the recovery of carrying costs, and approve the manner in which Entergy Texas allocates those costs among its retail customer classes. In December 2006, the PUCT app roved $381 million of reasonable and necessary hurricane reconstruction costs incurred through March 31, 2006, plus carrying costs, as eligible for recovery. After netting expected insurance proceeds, the amount is $353 million. In April 2007, the PUCT issued its financing order authorizing the issuance of securitization bonds to recover the $353 million of hurricane reconstruction costs and up to $6 million of transaction costs, offset by $32 million of related deferred income tax benefits. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a discussion of the June 2007 issuance of the securitization bonds.

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Entergy received a total of $317 million as of December 31, 2009 on its Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita insurance claims, including the settlements of its Hurricane Katrina claims with each of its two excess insurers. Of the $317 million received, $34 million has been allocated to Entergy Texas. Entergy has substantially completed its insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Rita. 

Electric Industry Restructuring 

In June 2009, a law was enacted in Texas that requires Entergy Texas to cease all activities relating to Entergy Texas’s transition to competition. The law allows Entergy Texas to remain a part of the SERC Region, although it does not prevent Entergy Texas from joining another power region. The law provides that proceedings to certify a power region that Entergy Texas belongs to as a qualified power region can be initiated by the PUCT, or on motion by another party, when the conditions supporting such a proceeding exist. Under the new law, the PUCT may not approve a transition to competition plan for Entergy Texas until the expiration of four years from the PUCT’s certification of Entergy Texas’s power region. In response to t he new law, Entergy Texas in June 2009 gave notice to the PUCT of the withdrawal of its previously filed transition to competition plan, and requested that its transition to competition proceeding be dismissed. In July 2009 the ALJ dismissed the proceeding. 

The new law also contains provisions that allow Entergy Texas take advantage of a cost recovery mechanism that permits annual filings for the recovery of reasonable and necessary expenditures for transmission infrastructure improvement and changes in wholesale transmission charges. This mechanism was previously available to other non-ERCOT Texas utility companies, but not to Entergy Texas. 

The new law further amends already existing law that had required Entergy Texas to propose for PUCT approval a tariff to allow eligible customers the ability to contract for competitive generation. The amending language in the new law provides, among other things, that: 1) the tariff shall not be implemented in a manner that harms the sustainability or competitiveness of manufacturers who choose not to participate in the tariff; 2) Entergy Texas shall “purchase competitive generation service, selected by the customer, and provide the generation at retail to the customer”; and 3) Entergy Texas shall provide and price transmission service and ancillary services under that tariff at a rate that is unbundled from its cost of service. 160; The new law directs that the PUCT may not issue an order on the tariff that is contrary to an applicable decision, rule, or policy statement of a federal regulatory agency having jurisdiction. 

State and Local Rate Regulation 

The rates that Entergy Texas charges for its services significantly influence its financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Entergy Texas is regulated and the rates charged to its customers are determined in regulatory proceedings. The PUCT, a governmental agency, is primarily responsible for approval of the rates charged to customers. 

Filings with the PUCT 

2009 Rate Case 

In December 2009, Entergy Texas filed a rate case requesting a $198.7 million increase reflecting an 11.5% return on common equity based on an adjusted June 2009 test year. The rate case also included a $2.8 million revenue requirement to provide supplemental funding for the decommissioning trust maintained for the 70% share of River Bend for which Entergy Texas retail customers are partially responsible, in response to an NRC notification of a projected shortfall of decommissioning funding assurance. Beginning in May 2010, Entergy Texas implemented a $17.5 million interim rate increase, subject to refund. Intervenors and PUCT Staff filed testimony recommending adjustments that would result in a maximum rate increase, based on the PUCT Staff’s testi mony, of $58 million. 

The parties filed a settlement in August 2010 intended to resolve the rate case proceeding. The settlement provides for a $59 million base rate increase for electricity usage beginning August 15, 2010, with an additional increase of $9 million for bills rendered beginning May 2, 2011. The settlement stipulates an authorized return on equity of 10.125%. Baseline values were established to be used in Entergy Texas's request for a transmission cost

recovery factor that will be made in a separate proceeding. The settlement states that Entergy Texas's fuel costs for the period April 2007 through June 2009 are reconciled, with $3.25 million of disallowed costs, which were included in an interim fuel refund. The settlement also sets River Bend decommissioning costs at $2.0 million annually. Consistent with the settlement, in the third quarter 2010, Entergy Texas amortized $11 million of rate case costs. The PUCT approved the settlement in December 2010. 

2007 Rate Case 

Entergy Texas made a rate filing in September 2007 with the PUCT requesting an annual rate increase totaling $107.5 million, including a base rate increase of $64.3 million and riders totaling $43.2 million. On December 16, 2008, Entergy Texas filed a term sheet that reflected a settlement agreement that included the PUCT Staff and the other active participants in the rate case. On December 19, 2008, the ALJs approved Entergy Texas’s request to implement interim rates reflecting the agreement. The agreement includes a $46.7 million base rate increase, among other provisions. Under the ALJs’ interim order, Entergy Texas implemented interim rates, subject to refund and surcharge, reflecting the rates established through the settlement . These rates became effective with bills rendered on and after January 28, 2009, for usage on and after December 19, 2008. In addition, the existing recovery mechanism for incremental purchased power capacity costs ceased as of January 28, 2009, with purchased power capacity costs then subsumed within the base rates set in this proceeding. The agreement adopted by the PUCT also reconciles fuel and purchased power costs for the period January 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007. Certain Texas municipalities exercised their original jurisdiction and took final action to approve rates consistent with the interim rates approved by the ALJs. In March 2009, the PUCT approved the settlement, which made the interim rates final. 

Fuel and Purchased Power Cost Recovery 

Entergy Texas’s rate schedules include a fixed fuel factor to recover fuel and purchased power costs, including carrying charges, not recovered in base rates. Semi-annual revisions of the fixed fuel factor are made in March and September based on the market price of natural gas and changes in fuel mix. The amounts collected under Entergy Texas’s fixed fuel factor and any interim surcharge or refund are subject to fuel reconciliation proceedings before the PUCT. 

In October 2007, Entergy Texas filed a request with the PUCT to refund $45.6 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through September 2007. In January 2008, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a stipulation and settlement agreement among the parties that updated the over-collection balance through November 2007 and established a refund amount, including interest, of $71 million. The PUCT approved the agreement in February 2008. The refund was made over a two-month period beginning February 2008, but was reduced by $10.3 million of under-recovered incremental purchased capacity costs. 

In January 2008, Entergy Texas made a compliance filing with the PUCT describing how its 2007 rough production cost equalization receipts under the System Agreement were allocated between Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions. In December 2008 the PUCT adopted an ALJ proposal for decision recommending an additional $18.6 million allocation to Texas retail customers. Because the PUCT allocation to Texas retail customers is inconsistent with the LPSC allocation to Louisiana retail customers, the PUCT's decision results in trapped costs between the Texas and Louisiana jurisdictions with no mechanism for recovery. Entergy Texas filed with the FERC a proposed amendment to the System Agreement bandwidth formula to specifically calculate the payments to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Texas of Entergy Gulf States, Inc.'s rough production cost equalization receipts for 2007. In May 2009 the FERC issued an order rejecting the proposed amendment. Because of the FERC's order, Entergy Texas recorded the effects of the PUCT's allocation of the additional $18.6 million to Texas retail customers in the second quarter 2009. On an after-tax basis, the charge to earnings was approximately $13.0 million (including interest). The PUCT and FERC decisions are now final. 

In May 2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund $46.1 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through February 2009. Entergy Texas requested that the proposed refund be made over a four-month period beginning June 2009. Pursuant to a stipulation among the various parties, in June 2009 the PUCT issued an order approving a refund of $59.2 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery overcollections through March 2009. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period beginning July 2009.

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

In October 2009, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $71 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through September 2009. Entergy Texas requested that the proposed refund be made over a six-month period beginning January 2010. Pursuant to a stipulation among the various parties, the PUCT issued an order approving a refund of $87.8 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery overcollections through October 2009. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period beginning January 2010. 

In June 2010, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $66 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through May 2010. In September 2010 the PUCT issued an order providing for a $77 million refund for fuel cost recovery over-collections through June 2010. The refund was made for most customers over a three-month period beginning with the September 2010 billing cycle. 

In December 2010, Entergy Texas filed with the PUCT a request to refund approximately $52 million, including interest, of fuel cost recovery over-collections through October 2010. Pursuant to a stipulation among the parties that was approved on an interim basis and is pending final action by the PUCT, Entergy Texas will refund over-collections of approximately $72.7 million through November 2010. The refund will be made for most customers over a three-month period beginning with the February 2011 billing cycle. 

Federal Regulation 

See “System Agreement”, “Independent Coordinator of Transmission”, “Notice to SERC Reliability Corporation regarding Reliability Standards”, and “U.S. Department of Justice Investigation” in the “Rate, Cost-recovery, and Other Regulation – Federal Regulation” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Finan cial Discussion and Analysis for a discussion of these topics. 

Industrial and Commercial 

Entergy Texas’s large industrial and commercial customers continually explore ways to reduce their energy costs. In particular, cogeneration is an option available to a portion of Entergy Texas’s industrial customer base. Entergy Texas responds by working with industrial and commercial customers and negotiating electric service contracts to provide, under existing rate schedules, competitive rates that match specific customer needs and load profiles. Entergy Texas actively participates in economic development, customer retention, and reclamation activities to increase industrial and commercial demand, from both new and existing customers. Entergy Texas does not currently expect additional significant losses to cogeneration because o f the current economics of the electricity markets and Entergy Texas’s marketing efforts in retaining industrial customers. 

Environmental Risks 

Entergy Texas’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that Entergy Texas is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of Entergy Texas’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material effect on the presentation of Entergy Texas’s financial position or results of operations.

Entergy Texas, Inc. and Subsidiaries 

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Unbilled Revenue 

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Entergy Texas records an estimate of the revenues earned for energy delivered since the latest customer billing. Each month the estimated unbilled revenue amounts are recorded as revenue and a receivable, and the prior month’s estimate is reversed. The difference between the estimate of the unbilled receivable at the beginning of the period and the end of the period is the amount of unbilled revenue recognized during the period. The estimate recorded is primarily based upon an estimate of customer usage during the unbilled period and the billed price to customers in that month. Therefore, revenue recognized may be affected by the estimated price and usage at the beginning and end of each period and fuel price fluctuations, in addition to changes in certain components of the calculation. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries’ Management’s Discussion and Analysis fo r further discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate. 

Cost Sensitivity 

The following chart reflects the sensitivity of qualified pension cost to changes in certain actuarial assumptions (dollars in thousands):

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. 

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for Entergy Texas in 2010 was $3.0 million. Entergy Texas anticipates 2011 qualified pension cost to be $4.4 million. Entergy Texas contributed $18.3 million to its qualified pension plans in 2010. Entergy Texas’s contributions to the pension trust are currently estimated to be approximately $15.9 million in 2011 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for Entergy Texas in 2010 were $5.6 million, including $1.1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Texas expects 2011 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $4.1 million, including $1.5 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. Entergy Texas expects to contribute approximately $5.2 million to its other postretirement plans in 2011.

SYSTEM ENERGY RESOURCES, INC. 

MANAGEMENT’S FINANCIAL DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 

System Energy’s principal asset currently consists of a 90% ownership and leasehold interest in Grand Gulf. The capacity and energy from its 90% interest is sold under the Unit Power Sales Agreement to its only four customers, Entergy Arkansas, Entergy Louisiana, Entergy Mississippi, and Entergy New Orleans. System Energy’s operating revenues are derived from the allocation of the capacity, energy, and related costs associated with its 90% interest in Grand Gulf pursuant to the Unit Power Sales Agreement. Payments under the Unit Power Sales Agreement are System Energy’s only source of operating revenues. 

Results of Operations 

Net Income 

2010 Compared to 2009 

Net income increased $33.7 million primarily due to a decrease in the effective income tax rate. 

2009 Compared to 2008 

Net income decreased $42.2 million primarily due to an increase in the effective income tax rate. 

An increase in allowance for equity funds used during construction, primarily due to the new nuclear development project discussed below, was offset by a decrease in interest income, primarily on money pool investments. 

Income Taxes 

The effective income tax rates for 2010, 2009, and 2008 were 40.4%, 66.5%, and 39.5%, respectively. The increase in the rate for 2009 is primarily due to the reallocation of Entergy Corporation consolidated tax benefits based on the resolution of IRS audits of prior tax years. See Note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% to the effective income tax rate and for a discussion of the IRS audits. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Cash Flow 

Cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 were as follows:

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Operating Activities 

Cash flow provided by operations decreased $167.5 million in 2010 primarily due to income tax payments of $56 million in 2010 compared to income tax refunds of $120.4 in 2009, and an increase of $26.6 million in pension contributions. In 2010, System Energy made tax payments in accordance with the Entergy Corporation and Subsidiary Companies Intercompany Income Tax Allocation Agreement. The payments result from the reversal of temporary differences for which System Energy previously received cash tax benefits and from estimated federal income tax payments for tax year 2010. See “Critical Accounting Estimates” below for a discussion of qualified pension and other postretirement benefits. font> 

Cash flow from operations increased by $199.4 million in 2009 primarily due to income tax refunds of $120.4 million in 2009 compared to income tax payments of $54.4 million in 2008. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities increased $35.2 million in 2010 primarily due to an increase of $129.5 million in nuclear fuel purchases due to the timing of refueling outages, and an increase of $62.3 million in construction costs primarily due to the Grand Gulf power uprate project. 

The increase was partially offset by: 

  ·    the proceeds from the transfer of $100.3 million in development costs related to Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC discussed below;    

  ·    money pool activity; and    

  ·    the repayment by Entergy New Orleans of a $25.6 million note issued in resolution of its bankruptcy proceedings.    

Increases in System Energy’s receivable from the money pool are a use of cash flow, and System Energy’s receivable from the money pool increased by $7.4 million in 2010. The money pool is an inter-company borrowing arrangement designed to reduce the Utility subsidiaries’ need for external short-term borrowings. 

Net cash flow used in investing activities increased $52.4 million in cash flow in 2009 primarily due to money pool activity. System Energy’s receivable from the money pool increased by $47.6 million in 2009 compared to decreasing by $10.7 million in 2008. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased $40.3 million in 2010 primarily due to: 

  ·    the issuance in April 2010 of $60 million of 5.33% Series G notes by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity to finance its fuel procurement activities; and    

  ·    commercial paper issuances by the nuclear fuel company variable interest entity to finance its fuel procurement activities.    

The decrease was partially offset by: 

  ·    an increase of $24.9 million in dividends paid on common stock; and    

  ·    an increase of $13.3 million in the January 2010 principal payment made on the Grand Gulf sale-leaseback compared to the January 2009 principal payment.    

Net cash flow used in financing activities decreased $17.0 million in 2009 primarily due to a decrease of $21.8 million in common stock dividends paid. 

See Note 5 to the financial statements for details of long-term debt.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Capital Structure 

System Energy’s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt, as shown in the following table. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Net debt consists of debt less cash and cash equivalents. Debt consists of capital lease obligations and long-term debt, including the currently maturing portion. Capital consists of debt and common shareholder’s equity. Net capital consists of capital less cash and cash equivalents. System Energy uses the net debt to net capital ratio in analyzing its financial condition and believes it provides useful information to its investors and creditors in evaluating System Energy’s financial condition. 

Uses of Capital 

System Energy requires capital resources for: 

  ·    construction and other capital investments;    

  ·    debt maturities;    

  ·    working capital purposes, including the financing of fuel costs; and    

  ·    dividend and interest payments.    

Following are the amounts of System Energy’s planned construction and other capital investments, existing debt and lease obligations (includes estimated interest payments), and other purchase obligations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

  (1)   Includes approximately $15 million annually for maintenance capital, which is planned spending on routine capital projects that are necessary to support reliability of service, equipment or systems and to support normal customer growth.  

  (2)   Includes estimated interest payments. Long-term debt is discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements.  

  (3)   Purchase obligations represent the minimum purchase obligation or cancellation charge for contractual obligations to purchase goods or services. For System Energy, it includes nuclear fuel purchase obligations.    

In addition to the contractual obligations given above, System Energy expects to contribute approximately $25 million to its pension plans and approximately $3.5 million to its other postretirement plans in 2011 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011. 

Also in addition to the contractual obligations, System Energy has $172.2 million of unrecognized tax benefits and interest net of unused tax attributes and payments for which the timing of payments beyond 12 months cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainties in the timing of effective settlement of tax positions. See Note 3 to the financial statements for additional information regarding unrecognized tax benefits.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

The planned capital investment estimate for System Energy reflects capital required to support the existing business of System Energy. The estimate also includes the costs of System Energy’s planned approximate 178 MW uprate of the Grand Gulf nuclear plant. The project is currently expected to cost $575 million, including transmission upgrades. On November 30, 2009, the MPSC issued a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity for implementation of the uprate. 

System Energy has also invested, through its subsidiary Entergy New Nuclear Development, LLC, in initial development costs for potential new nuclear development at the Grand Gulf and River Bend sites, including licensing and design activities. This project is in the early stages, and several issues remain to be addressed over time before significant additional capital would be committed to this project. In addition, Entergy temporarily suspended reviews of the two license applications for the sites and will explore alternative nuclear technologies for this project. As of December 31, 2009, $100.3 million in construction work in progress was recorded on System Energy’s balance sheet related to this project. In the first quarter 2010 this c onstruction work in progress was transferred to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana, and Entergy Mississippi. 

Entergy’s Utility supply plan initiative will continue to seek to transform its generation portfolio with new or repowered generation resources. Opportunities resulting from the supply plan initiative, including new projects or the exploration of alternative financing sources, could result in increases or decreases in the capital expenditure estimates given above. 

As a wholly-owned subsidiary, System Energy dividends its earnings to Entergy Corporation at a percentage determined monthly. Currently, all of System Energy’s retained earnings are available for distribution. 

Sources of Capital 

System Energy’s sources to meet its capital requirements include: 

  ·    internally generated funds;    

  ·    cash on hand;    

  ·    debt issuances; and    

  ·    bank financing under new or existing facilities.    

System Energy may refinance or redeem debt prior to maturity, to the extent market conditions and interest and dividend rates are favorable. 

All debt and common stock issuances by System Energy require prior regulatory approval. Debt issuances are also subject to issuance tests set forth in its bond indentures and other agreements. System Energy has sufficient capacity under these tests to meet its foreseeable capital needs. 

System Energy has obtained a short-term borrowing authorization from the FERC under which it may borrow, through October 2011, up to the aggregate amount, at any one time outstanding, of $200 million. See Note 4 to the financial statements for further discussion of System Energy’s short-term borrowing limits. System Energy has also obtained an order from the FERC authorizing long-term securities issuances. The current long-term authorization extends through July 2011. 

System Energy’s receivables from the money pool were as follows as of December 31 for each of the following years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

In May 2007, $22.5 million of System Energy’s receivable from the money pool was replaced by a note receivable from Entergy New Orleans. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a description of the money pool.

Management’s Financial Discussion and Analysis 

Nuclear Matters 

System Energy owns and operates Grand Gulf. System Energy is, therefore, subject to the risks related to owning and operating a nuclear plant. These include risks from the use, storage, handling and disposal of high-level and low-level radioactive materials, regulatory requirement changes, including changes resulting from events at other plants, limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available for losses in connection with nuclear operations, and technological and financial uncertainties related to decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives, including the sufficiency of funds in decommissioning trusts. In the event of an unanticipated early shutdown of Grand Gulf, System Energy may be required to provide additional funds or credit support to satisfy regula tory requirements for decommissioning. 

Environmental Risks 

System Energy’s facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities having jurisdiction over air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes, and other environmental matters. Management believes that System Energy is in substantial compliance with environmental regulations currently applicable to its facilities and operations. Because environmental regulations are subject to change, future compliance costs cannot be precisely estimated. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of System Energy’s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and judgments that can have a significant effect on reported financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Management has identified the following accounting policies and estimates as critical because they are based on assumptions and measurements that involve a high degree of uncertainty, and there is the potential for future changes in the assumptions and measurements that could produce estimates that would have a material impact on the presentation of System Energy’s financial position or results of operations. 

Nuclear Decommissioning Costs 

See “Nuclear Decommissioning Costs” in the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for discussion of the estimates inherent in accounting for nuclear decommissioning costs. 

Qualified Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 

Entergy sponsors qualified defined benefit pension plans which cover substantially all employees. Additionally, Entergy currently provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all employees who reach retirement age while still working for Entergy. Entergy’s reported costs of providing these benefits, as described in Note 11 to the financial statements, are impacted by numerous factors including the provisions of the plans, changing employee demographics, and various actuarial calculations, assumptions, and accounting mechanisms. See the “Critical Accounting Estimates” section of Entergy Corporation and Subsidiaries Management’s Discussion and Analysis for furth er discussion. Because of the complexity of these calculations, the long-term nature of these obligations, and the importance of the assumptions utilized, Entergy’s estimate of these costs is a critical accounting estimate.

Each fluctuation above assumes that the other components of the calculation are held constant. 

Costs and Funding 

Total qualified pension cost for System Energy in 2010 was $1.9 million. System Energy anticipates 2011 qualified pension cost to be $6.9 million. System Energy contributed $31.3 million to its qualified pension plans in 2010 and expects to contribute approximately $25 million in 2011 although the required pension contributions will not be known with more certainty until the January 1, 2011 valuations are completed by April 1, 2011. 

Total postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs for System Energy in 2010 were $3.5 million, including $1.1 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. System Energy expects 2011 postretirement health care and life insurance benefit costs to approximate $4.1 million, including $1.4 million in savings due to the estimated effect of future Medicare Part D subsidies. System Energy anticipates contributions for postretirement health care and life insurance benefits costs to be $3.5 million in 2011.
