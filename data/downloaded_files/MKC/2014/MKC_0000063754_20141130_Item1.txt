ITEM 1. BUSINESS

McCormick is a global leader in flavor. The company manufactures, markets and distributes spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retail outlets, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Mexico, India, Singapore, Central America, Thailand and South Africa. McCormick & Company, Incorporated was formed in 1915 under Maryland law as the successor to a business established in 1889.

Business Segments 

We operate in two business segments, consumer and industrial. Demand for flavor is growing globally, and across both segments we have the customer base and product breadth to participate in all types of eating occasions. Our products deliver flavor when cooking at home, dining out, purchasing a quick service meal or enjoying a snack. We offer our customers and consumers a range of products from premium to value-priced. 

Consistent with market conditions in each segment, our consumer business has a higher overall profit margin than our industrial business. Historically, the consumer business contributes approximately 60% of sales and 80% of operating income, and the industrial business contributes approximately 40% of sales and 20% of operating income.

For financial information about our business segments, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis–Results of Operations” and note 16 of the financial statements.

For a discussion of our recent acquisition activity, please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis–Acquisitions” and note 2 of the financial statements.

Consumer Business. From locations around the world, our brands reach consumers in more than 135 countries and territories. Our leading brands in the Americas include McCormick®, Lawry’s® and Club House®. We also market authentic ethnic brands such as Zatarain’s®, Thai Kitchen® and Simply Asia®. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) our major brands include the Ducros®, Schwartz® and Kamis® brands of spices, herbs and seasonings and an extensive line of Vahiné® brand dessert items. In the Asia/Pacific region, we market products under the McCormick and DaQiao® brands in China. In Australia, we market our spices, herbs and seasonings under the McCormick brand and our dessert products under the Aeroplane® brand. In India, our majority-owned joint venture owns and trades under the Kohinoor® brand.

Our customers span a variety of retail outlets that include grocery, mass merchandise, warehouse clubs, discount and drug stores, served directly and indirectly through distributors or wholesalers. In addition to marketing our branded products to these customers, we are also a leading supplier of private label items, also known as store brands.

Approximately half of our consumer business is spices, herbs and seasonings. For these products, we are a category leader in our primary markets. There are a number of competitors in the spices, herbs and seasoning category, many with less than 3% share of sales.

More than 250 other brands of spices, herbs and seasonings are sold in the U.S. with additional brands in international markets. Some are owned by large food manufacturers, while others are supplied by small privately owned companies. In this competitive environment, we are leading with innovation and brand marketing, and applying our analytical tools to help customers optimize the profitability of their spice and seasoning category while simultaneously increasing our sales.

Industrial Business. In our industrial business, we provide a wide range of products to multinational food manufacturers and foodservice customers. The foodservice customers are supplied both directly and indirectly through distributors. Among food manufacturers and foodservice customers, many of our relationships have been active for decades. We focus our resources on our strategic partners that we believe offer the greatest prospects for growth. Our range of products remains one of the broadest in the industry and includes seasoning blends, spices and herbs, condiments, coating systems and compound flavors. In addition to a broad range of flavor solutions, we 

strive to achieve customer intimacy. Our customers benefit from our expertise in many areas, including sensory testing, culinary research, food safety and flavor application.

Our industrial business has a number of competitors. Some tend to specialize in a particular range of products and have a limited geographic reach. Other competitors include larger publicly held flavor companies that are more global in nature, but which also tend to specialize in a more limited range of flavor solutions.

Raw Materials

The most significant raw materials used in our business are pepper, dairy products, rice, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), onion, garlic and wheat flour. Pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the United States. Other raw materials, like dairy products and onion, are primarily sourced from within the U.S. and locally, for many of our international locations. Because the raw materials are agricultural products, they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, and other factors beyond our control.

We respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery, customer price adjustments and cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement program.

Customers

Our products are sold directly to customers and also through brokers, wholesalers and distributors. In the consumer segment, products are then sold to consumers through a variety of retail outlets, including grocery, mass merchandise, warehouse clubs, discount and drug stores under a variety of brands. In the industrial segment, products are used by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and by foodservice customers as ingredients for menu items to enhance the flavor of their foods. Customers for the industrial segment include food manufacturers and the foodservice industry supplied both directly and indirectly through distributors.

We have a large number of customers for our products. Sales to one of our consumer business customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for 11% of consolidated sales in 2014, 12% of consolidated sales in 2013 and 11% of consolidated sales in 2012. Sales to one of our industrial business customers, PepsiCo, Inc., accounted for 11% of consolidated sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012. In 2014, 2013 and 2012 the top three customers in our industrial business represented between 53% and 54% of our global industrial sales. 

The dollar amount of backlog orders for our business is not material to an understanding of our business, taken as a whole. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.

Trademarks, Licenses and Patents

We own a number of trademark registrations. Although in the aggregate these trademarks are material to our business, the loss of any one of those trademarks, with the exception of our “McCormick,” “Lawry’s,” “Zatarain’s,” “Club House,” “Ducros,” “Schwartz,” “Vahiné,” “Kamis,” "DaQiao" and “Kohinoor” trademarks, would not have a material adverse effect on our business. The “Mc – McCormick” trademark is extensively used by us in connection with the sale of our food products in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. markets. The terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by law, and the registrations will be renewed for as long as we deem them to be useful.

We have entered into a number of license agreements authorizing the use of our trademarks by affiliated and non-affiliated entities. The loss of these license agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our business. The term of the license agreements is generally three to five years or until such time as either party terminates the agreement. Those agreements with specific terms are renewable upon agreement of the parties.

We also own various patents, none of which individually are material to our business.

Seasonality

Due to seasonal factors inherent in our business, our sales, income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year, increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. This seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns, primarily in the consumer segment.

Working Capital

In order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter, we usually build our inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year. We generally finance working capital items (inventory and receivables) through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of our liquidity and capital resources, see note 6 of the financial statements and the “Liquidity and Financial Condition” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis.”

Competition

Each segment operates in markets around the world that are highly competitive. In this competitive environment, our growth strategies include customer intimacy and product innovation based on consumer insights. Additionally, in the consumer segment we are building brand recognition and loyalty through increased advertising and promotions.

Research and Development

Many of our products are prepared from confidential formulas developed by our research laboratories and product development teams, and, in some cases, customer proprietary formulas. Expenditures for research and development were $62.0 million in 2014, $61.3 million in 2013, and $57.8 million in 2012. The amount spent on customer-sponsored research activities is not material.

Governmental Regulation

We are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world that apply to our global businesses. In the United States, the safety, production, transportation, distribution, advertising, labeling and sale of many of our products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Food Safety Modernization Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, state consumer protection laws, competition laws, anti-corruption laws, customs and trade laws, federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws, various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes, laws and regulatory requirements.

Environmental Regulations

The cost of compliance with federal, state and local provisions related to protection of the environment has had no material effect on our business. There were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities in fiscal year 2014, and there are no material expenditures planned for such purposes in fiscal year 2015.

Employees

We had approximately 10,000 full-time employees worldwide as of November 30, 2014. Our operations have not been affected significantly by work stoppages and, in the opinion of management, employee relations are good. We have no collective bargaining contracts in the United States. At our foreign subsidiaries, approximately 1,300 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements. 

Financial Information about Geographic Locations

Foreign Operations

We are subject in varying degrees to certain risks typically associated with a global business, such as local economic and market conditions, exchange rate fluctuations, restrictions on investments, royalties and dividends. Approximately 45% of sales in fiscal year 2014 were from non-U.S. operations. For information on how we manage some of these risks, see the “Market Risk Sensitivity” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis.”
