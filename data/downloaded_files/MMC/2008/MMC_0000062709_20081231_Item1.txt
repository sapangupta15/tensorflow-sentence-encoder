OUR BUSINESSES  

Risk and Insurance Services  

Risk and Insurance Services, comprising Marsh and Guy Carpenter, is MMCs largest business segment. This segment generated 47% of MMCs total operating segment revenue in 2008 and employs approximately 26,900 colleagues worldwide.  

Marsh  

Marsh is a world leader in delivering risk and insurance services and solutions to its clients. From its founding in 1871 to the present day, Marsh has provided thought leadership and innovation for clients and the insurance industryintroducing and promoting the concept and practice of client representation through brokerage, the discipline of risk management, the globalization of insurance and risk management services and many other new tools and service platforms.

Table of Contents 

Marsh generated approximately 40% of MMCs total operating segment revenue in 2008. More than 24,000 Marsh colleagues provide risk management, risk consulting, insurance broking, alternative risk financing, and insurance program management services to a wide range of businesses, government entities and professional service organizations around the world in more than 100 countries. Marshs clients vary by size, industry, geography and risk exposures.  

Insurance Broking and Risk Consulting   

In its main insurance broking and risk consulting business, Marsh employs a team approach to address clients risk management and insurance needs. Each client relationship is coordinated by a client executive who draws from the many industry and risk specialties within Marsh to assemble the resources needed to analyze, measure and assist a client in managing its various risks. Product and service offerings include program design and placement, post-placement program support and administration, claims advocacy, and a wide array of risk analysis and risk management consulting services. Services are organized and provided in three distinct business segments: Large Organizations, Mid-Size Organizations and Small & Medium Enterprise Organizations.  

Large Organizations. Marshs Global Risk Management (GRM) Practice focuses on clients with a broad footprint, including U.S.-based entities with global operations or international companies with U.S. exposures and insurance program elements. Generally, these clients have highly complex insurance and risk funding program needs, with a wide array of risk management consulting requirements. Marsh serves its more than 3,000 GRM clients using a global service model that provides customized solutions embracing risk transfer, risk mitigation and risk retention brokerage and consulting services. GRM includes the Multinational Practice, which specializes in the delivery of all multinational products and services, with a particular focus on programs that require the combination and coordination of global and local components. Colleagues in this practice specialize in understanding and prioritizing the local country and worldwide risk issues and needs of each clients business, such as those arising from the local regulatory and legal environment.  

Mid-Size Organizations. Clients served in this segment (known as National Brokerage in the United States) are mid-size firms whose needs vary depending on industry, size, geography and the competitive environment in which they operate. Many of these clients do not have full-time risk managers and thus look to Marsh to provide the expertise, advice and solutions required by firms in their particular industries. Marsh colleagues help these clients develop tailored solutions for their operational and risk management needs, and coordinate all client program service and support activities. Marsh brokers provide these clients with insurance program placement, ongoing technical advice, and management of insurance market relationships.  

Small & Medium Enterprise Organizations. The small and medium enterprise (SME) sector is the fastest growing segment of many economies around the world, and its constituent organizations generally have special needs for efficient risk management. These clients demand service excellence and tend to rely heavily on programs and prepackaged products and solutions.  

In 2008, Marsh established the Marsh & McLennan Agency to service small to middle market organizations that tend to be U.S.-based firms with little overseas insurance needs. The Agency is targeted to customers who seek market knowledge, experience and expertise in a streamlined manner at competitive prices, and who do not require highly customized product adaptations. The Agency will offer Commercial Property, Casualty, Directors & Officers Liability, Surety, Employee Benefits and Personal Lines products through a dedicated sales and service force in retail locations across the United States.

For a more detailed discussion of revenue sources and factors affecting revenue in our Risk Consulting & Technology segment, see Part II, Item 7 (Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) of this report.  

Regulation  

MMCs activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under United States federal and state laws, as well as laws of other countries in which MMCs subsidiaries operate. See Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) below for a discussion of how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our businesses.  

Risk and Insurance Services. While laws and regulations vary from location to location, every state of the United States and most foreign jurisdictions require insurance market intermediaries and related service providers (such as insurance brokers, agents and consultants, reinsurance brokers,   

9  

Table of Contents 

 managing general agents and third party administrators) to hold an individual and/or company license from a governmental agency or self-regulatory organization. Some jurisdictions issue licenses only to individual residents or locally-owned business entities; in this case, if MMC has no licensed subsidiary, we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction.  

Beginning in January 2005, all European Union member states were required to implement the Insurance Mediation Directive. This Directive aims to apply consistent minimum professional standards to insurance intermediaries, including a licensing system based on an assessment of factors such as professional competence, financial capacity and professional indemnity insurance. As member states of the European Union adopt regulations to comply with the Directive, our insurance intermediary operations in the European Union have become subject to enhanced regulatory requirements. In January 2005, as part of the implementation of the Directive in the United Kingdom, the power and responsibilities of the Financial Services Authority, or FSA, were expanded to include regulation of insurance and reinsurance intermediaries in the United Kingdom.  

Insurance authorities in the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which MMCs subsidiaries do business, including the FSA in the United Kingdom, also have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations typically provide for segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them.  

Certain of MMCs Risk and Insurance Services activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment, securities and futures licensing authorities. In the United States, Marsh and Guy Carpenter use the services of MMC Securities Corp., a U.S.-registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, member FINRA/SIPC, primarily in connection with investment banking-related services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions. Also in the United States, Marsh uses the services of Interlink Securities Corp., primarily in connection with variable insurance products. Guy Carpenter provides advice on securities or investments in the European Union through MMC Securities (Europe) Ltd. (formerly GC Securities Ltd.), which is authorized and regulated by the FSA. Marsh receives investment management services in the European Union from another MMC subsidiary, Marsh Investment Service Limited, which is also regulated by the FSA. MMC Securities Corp., Interlink Securities Corp. and MMC Securities (Europe) Ltd. are indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of MMC.  

In some jurisdictions, insurance-related taxes may be due either directly from clients or from the insurance broker. In the latter case, the broker customarily looks to the client for payment.  

Consulting. Certain of Mercers retirement-related consulting services are subject to pension law and financial regulation in many countries, including by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, in the United States and the FSA in the United Kingdom. In addition, the trustee services, investment services (including advice to individuals on the investment of personal pension assets and assumption of discretionary investment management responsibilities) and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to investment and securities regulations in various jurisdictions. The benefits insurance consulting and brokerage services provided by Mercer and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to the same licensing requirements and regulatory oversight as the insurance market intermediaries described above regarding our Risk and Insurance Services businesses. In the United States, Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group use the services of MMC Securities Corp. primarily in connection with the sale of retirement and employee benefit plans, and investment banking services, respectively.  

Risk Consulting & Technology. Certain of Krolls risk consulting and investigative activities are licensed and regulated at the federal, state and local level in the United States and abroad. Many of these activities also involve the use of data from outside sources, including third party vendors and governmental records. As a result, changes in existing, or the implementation of new laws and regulations, particularly relating to privacy, could interfere with Krolls historical access to and use of such data. Substance abuse testing laboratories operated by a Kroll subsidiary are certified on the federal level and licensed in a number of states.

Competitive Conditions  

MMC faces strong competition in all of its businesses from providers of similar products and services. MMC also encounters strong competition throughout its businesses from both public corporations and private firms in attracting and retaining qualified employees. In addition to the discussion below, see Risks Relating to MMC Generally Competitive Risks, in Part I, Item 1A of this report.  

Risk and Insurance Services. MMCs combined insurance and reinsurance services businesses are global in scope. The principal bases upon which our insurance and reinsurance businesses compete include the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. MMC encounters strong competition from other insurance and reinsurance brokerage firms that operate on a nationwide or worldwide basis, from a large number of regional and local firms in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere, from insurance and reinsurance companies that market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents and from other businesses, including commercial and investment banks, accounting firms and consultants, that provide risk-related services and products. Although the major global insurance brokerage firms against whom Marsh competes have, like us, stopped using contingent commission arrangements, many specialist, regional and local firms have not done so. The continuing acceptance of contingent commission revenue by certain of Marshs competitors may provide them greater pricing flexibility and put Marsh at a competitive disadvantage.   

Certain insureds and groups of insureds have established programs of self insurance (including captive insurance companies) as a supplement or alternative to third-party insurance, thereby reducing in some cases their need for insurance placements. There are also many other providers of affinity group and private client services, including specialized firms, insurance companies and other institutions.  

The continuing impact of legal and regulatory proceedings concerning our insurance brokerage operations also could affect Marshs competitive position. These proceedings are discussed in more detail in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report. Please also read our discussion of the risks associated with these proceedings and their impact under Part I, Item 1A (Risk Factors) below.  

Consulting. MMCs consulting and HR outsourcing businesses face strong competition from other privately and publicly held worldwide and national companies, as well as regional and local firms. These businesses compete generally on the basis of the range, quality and cost of the services and products provided to clients. Competitors include independent consulting and outsourcing firms, as well as consulting and outsourcing operations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology and financial services firms.  

Mercers investment consulting and investment management businesses face competition from many sources, including multi-manager services offered by other investment consulting firms and financial institutions.  

In many cases, clients have the option of handling the services provided by Mercer and Oliver Wyman Group internally, without assistance from outside advisors.  

Risk Consulting & Technology. In Risk Consulting and Technology, we face competition from local, regional, national and international firms that provide similar services in the fields of accounting, investigative and security services, consulting and technology services. Krolls Consulting Services Group faces competition from local, regional, national and international accounting firms who provide forensic accounting, litigation support and investigative services, as well as other specialist firms providing architectural engineering and security consulting services. Krolls Litigation Support and Data Recovery and Background Screening businesses face competition from a variety of law firms, independent service providers and technology companies.  

Segmentation of Activity by Type of Service and Geographic Area of Operation.  

Financial information relating to the types of services provided by MMC and the geographic areas of its operations is incorporated herein by reference to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included under Part II, Item 8 of this report.
