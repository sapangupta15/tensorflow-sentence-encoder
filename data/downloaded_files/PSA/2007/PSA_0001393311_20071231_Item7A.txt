ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
- -------------------------------------------------------------------

     To limit our exposure to market risk, we principally finance our operations
and growth with permanent equity capital  consisting  either of common shares or
preferred  shares.  At December  31,  2007,  our debt as a  percentage  of total
shareholders' equity (based on book values) was 12.2%.

     Our preferred  shares are not redeemable at the option of the holders.  Our
Series V shares  are  currently  redeemable.  Except  under  certain  conditions
relating to the Company's  qualification as a REIT, the preferred shares are not
redeemable by the Company prior to the  following  dates:  Series W - October 6,
2008, Series X - November 13, 2008, Series Y - January 2, 2009, Series Z - March
5, 2009,  Series A - March 31, 2009,  Series B - September 30, 2009,  Series C -
September  13, 2009,  Series D - February  28, 2010,  Series E - April 27, 2010,
Series F - August 23, 2010, Series G - December 12, 2010, Series H - January 19,
2011,  Series I - May 3, 2011, Series K - August 8, 2011, Series L - October 20,
2011,  Series M - January 9, 2012 and  Series N - July 2, 2012.  On or after the
respective  dates,  each of the series of preferred shares will be redeemable at
the option of the Company,  in whole or in part, at $25 per depositary share (or
share in the case of the Series Y), plus  accrued and unpaid  dividends  through
the redemption date.

     Our market risk sensitive  instruments  include notes payable and borrowing
on bank credit facilities,  which totaled $1,031,847,000 and none, respectively,
at December 31, 2007.

     We are exposed to changes in interest  rates  primarily  from the  floating
rate debt arrangements we acquired in the merger with Shurgard.

     We  have  foreign  currency  exposures  related  to our  investment  in the
construction, acquisition, and operation of storage centers in countries outside
the U.S. to the extent such  activities are financed with financial  instruments
or equity denominated in non-functional  currencies. The aggregate book value of
such real estate and intangibles was approximately  $1.7 billion at December 31,
2007.  Since all foreign debt is  denominated  in the  corresponding  functional
currency,  our currency  exposure is limited to our investment  (both equity and
intercompany debt) in those countries.  Countries in which Shurgard had exposure
to foreign  currency  fluctuations  include  Belgium,  France,  the Netherlands,
Sweden, Denmark, Germany and the United Kingdom.

     The table below  summarizes  annual debt  maturities  and  weighted-average
interest  rates  on our  outstanding  debt  at the end of each  year  (based  on
relevant  LIBOR of 4.60% and a EURIBOR  of 4.29% at  December  31,  2007 and the
applicable  forward  curve for  following  years) and fair  values  required  to
evaluate our expected  cash-flows  under debt  agreements and our sensitivity to
interest rate changes at December 31, 2007 (dollar amounts in thousands).

(1)  Amounts include borrowings under our line of credit, which expires in 2012.

(2)  First   Shurgard  and  Second   Shurgard  have  senior  credit   agreements
     denominated in Euros to borrow,  in aggregate,  up to  (euro)271.6  million
     ($399.8  million as of December 31,  2007).  As of December  31, 2007,  the
     available amount under those credit facilities was in aggregate  (euro)12.5
     million ($18.4 million). Approximately $189.1 million in debt owed by First
     Shurgard  was  originally  scheduled  to mature in May  2008.  However,  in
     February  2008,  under the terms of the related  credit  agreement  we have
     requested a one-year extension of the loan until May 2009. Assuming we have
     met our loan  covenants,  which we  believe  we have  met,  the  lender  is
     required to grant our request.

     At  December  31,  2007,  through  the  Shurgard  Merger,  we were party to
pay-fixed,  receive-variable  interest  rate swaps.  The notional  amounts,  the
weighted-average  pay rates and the terms of these  agreements are summarized as
follows:

     Based on our outstanding variable-rate EURIBOR debt and interest rate swaps
at December 31, 2007, a hypothetical increase in the interest rates of 100 basis
points would cause the value of our derivative financial instruments to increase
by $3.0 million.  Conversely,  a hypothetical  decrease in the interest rates of
100 basis points would cause the value of our derivative  financial  instruments
to decrease by $3.0 million.

     On January 2, 2007, we prepaid the (euro)325 million  collateralized  notes
($429  million  at  December  31,  2006) at our  European  operations  that were
otherwise  payable in 2011. We also terminated the related European currency and
interest rate hedges.  Accordingly,  the remaining debt in Europe relates to the
joint venture properties,  in which we have a 20% equity interest, and which are
consolidated for financial reporting purposes.
