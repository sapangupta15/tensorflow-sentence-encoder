PART I  

ITEM 1. Business. Parker-Hannifin Corporation is a leading worldwide full-line diversified manufacturer of motion and control technologies and systems, including fluid power systems, electromechanical controls and related components. Fluid power involves the transfer and control of power through the medium of liquid, gas or air, in hydraulic, pneumatic and vacuum applications. Fluid power systems move and position materials, control machines, vehicles and equipment and improve industrial efficiency and productivity. Components of a simple fluid power system include one or more pumps which generate pressure, one or more valves which control the flow of the fluid, one or more actuators which translate the pressure from the fluid into mechanical energy, one or more filters to ensure proper fluid condition and numerous hoses, couplings, fittings and seals. Electromechanical control involves the use of electronic components and systems to control motion and precisely locate or vary speed in automation and aerospace applications. In addition to motion control products, the Company also is a leading worldwide producer of fluid purification, fluid and fuel control, process instrumentation, air conditioning, refrigeration, electromagnetic shielding and thermal management products and systems.

Research and Product Development  

The Company continually researches the feasibility of new products and services through its development laboratories and testing facilities in many of its worldwide manufacturing locations. Its research and product development staff includes chemists, mechanical, electronic and electrical engineers and physicists.  

Research and development costs relating to the development of new products and services and the improvement of existing products and services amounted to $303,097,752 in fiscal year 2008, $253,091,228 in fiscal year 2007, and $203,702,371 in fiscal year 2006. These amounts include costs incurred by the Company related to independent research and development initiatives as well as costs incurred in connection with research and development contracts. Costs incurred in connection with research and development contracts for each of the respective fiscal years 2008, 2007 and 2006 were $47,757,134, $40,893,768 and $37,531,597.

Backlog and Seasonal Nature of Business  

The Companys backlog by business segment for the past two fiscal years, as set forth on pages 13-5 to 13-7 of Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is incorporated into this section by reference. The Companys backlog at June 30, 2008 was approximately $3,651,285,185 and at June 30, 2007 was approximately $2,935,232,549. Approximately 83% of the Companys backlog at June 30, 2008 is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding twelve months. The Companys business generally is not seasonal in nature.  

Environmental Regulation  

The Company is subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. Among other environmental laws, the Company is subject to the U.S. federal Superfund law, under which the Company has been designated as a potentially responsible party and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys Superfund priority list.  

As of June 30, 2008, the Company is involved in environmental remediation at 33 manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by the Company and has been named as a potentially responsible party, along with other companies, at one off-site waste disposal facility and three regional sites.  

The Company believes that its policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures by the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past, and, the Company believes, will not have in the future, material effects on the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of the Company.  

As of June 30, 2008, the Company has a reserve of $16,022,463 for environmental matters which are probable and reasonably estimable. This reserve is recorded based upon the best estimate of costs to be incurred in light of the progress made in determining the magnitude of remediation costs, the timing and extent of remedial actions required by governmental authorities and the amount of the Companys liability in proportion to other responsible parties.  

The Companys estimated total liability for the above mentioned sites ranges from a minimum of $16,022,463 to a maximum of $79,633,043. The largest estimate for any one site is approximately $8,209,933. The actual costs to be incurred by the Company will be dependent on final delineation of contamination, final determination of remedial action required, negotiations with federal and state agencies with respect to cleanup levels, changes in regulatory requirements, innovations in investigatory and remedial technology, effectiveness of remedial technologies employed, the ultimate ability of the other responsible parties to pay, and any insurance or third-party recoveries.

The Company is subject to governmental regulations in regard to energy supplies both in the United States and elsewhere. To date, the Company has not experienced any significant disruptions of its operations due to energy curtailments.  

Steel, brass, aluminum, elastomeric and thermoplastic materials and chemicals are the principal raw materials used by the Company. These materials are available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet the requirements of the Company.
