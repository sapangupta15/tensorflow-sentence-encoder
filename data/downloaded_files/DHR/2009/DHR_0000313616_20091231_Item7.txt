ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is designed to provide a reader of Danahers financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company management. The Companys MD&A is divided into four main sections:  

       Overview  

       Results of Operations  

       Liquidity and Capital Resources  

       Critical Accounting Policies  

OVERVIEW  

General  

Please see Item 1. Business  General for a discussion of Danahers objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value. Danaher is a multinational corporation with global operations. During 2009, approximately 52% of Danahers sales were derived from customers outside the United States. As a global business, Danahers operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic and political factors. For example, in those industry segments where the Company is a capital equipment provider, revenues depend on the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of the Companys customers, who may delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and in the economy. Danahers geographic and industry diversity, as well as the diversity of its products and services, typically helps limit the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on the consolidated operating results. However, the broad impact of the worldwide credit market turmoil and economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 negatively impacted the results of operations of most of the Companys businesses. Given the broad range of products manufactured and geographies served, management does not use any indices other than general economic trends to predict the overall outlook for the Company. The Companys individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future.  

As a result of our geographic and industry diversity we face a variety of challenges and opportunities, including rapid technological development in most of our served markets, the expansion of opportunities in emerging markets, trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force and consolidation of our competitors. We operate in a highly competitive business environment in most markets, and our long-term growth will depend in particular on our ability to expand our business (including through geographical and product line expansion), identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions, develop innovative new products with higher gross profit margins and continue to improve operating efficiency and organizational effectiveness. We are making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions, to address the rapid pace of technological change in our served markets and to globalize our manufacturing and customer facing resources in order to be responsive to our customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of our operations.  

Business Performance  

During 2009, lower spending and investment by both businesses and consumers resulted in a substantial decline in demand for most of the Companys products. These conditions began in the third quarter of 2008 as global financial markets were in turmoil and continued throughout 2009. Demand stabilized in most businesses in the fourth quarter of 2009. Sales declined across all segments and major geographic regions, particularly in the United States and Europe. Unfavorable foreign currency translation also negatively impacted results for the year due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar as compared with 2008. Given the difficult economic environment, the Company implemented significant restructuring actions to rationalize its cost structure to a level appropriate for the conditions (refer Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Despite the challenging environment, the operating margin impacts of lower sales levels and restructuring costs were partially offset by the benefits of 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions, other productivity improvements, higher pricing in certain markets and lower material costs. The Company also generated operating cash flow near the same level as 2008 primarily by reducing inventory levels to reflect the lower levels of customer demand and by effectively managing accounts receivable. The Company also took advantage of an improving acquisition market in 2009 by consummating fifteen acquisitions, as discussed below, and signing definitive agreements to acquire an additional three businesses.

Acquisitions  

The Company acquired fifteen businesses during 2009 for consideration of approximately $704 million in cash, net of cash acquired. These businesses were acquired to complement existing units of the Medical Technologies, Professional Instrumentation and Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these fifteen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $430 million.  

Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of the Analytical Technologies division of MDS, which includes a 50% ownership position in the Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex joint venture (AB SCIEX), a mass spectrometry business, and a 100% ownership position in the Molecular Devices Corporation, a bioresearch and analytical instrumentation company. In a separate, but related transaction, the Company simultaneously completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership position in AB SCIEX from Life Technologies Corporation. The aggregate purchase price for the combined transactions was $1.1 billion, including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. AB SCIEX and Molecular Devices Corporation now operate within the Companys Medical Technologies segment, and are expected to increase the Medical Technologies segments annual revenues by approximately $650 million. The acquisition of AB SCIEX significantly expands the Companys position in the life sciences and diagnostics business and in particular establishes a position in the mass spectrometry market. AB SCIEX is expected to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities in the Companys Medical Technologies segment, both through the growth of existing products and services and through the potential acquisition of complementary businesses. Company management and other personnel are devoting significant resources to the successful integration of the acquired businesses into Danaher.  

Settlement of Litigation  

During the third quarter of 2009, Ormco Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, settled certain litigation pending between Ormco and Align Technology, Inc. (Align). Among other provisions, as part of the settlement, Align paid $13 million in cash to Ormco and issued to the Company 7.6 million shares of Align common stock which, following issuance, represented an approximately ten percent ownership interest in Align. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $85 million ($53 million after tax or $0.16 per share) related to the settlement representing the cash received and the value of the shares received on the date the shares were issued to the Company, net of $13 million of related legal and direct settlement costs incurred. This gain is reflected as other (income) expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Earnings.  

Restructuring Activities  

During 2009, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring and other related charges totaling $238.5 million. Of the total 2009 restructuring costs incurred, $192.3 million ($144.4 million net of tax or $0.43 per diluted share) was incurred pursuant to plans approved by the Company in April and August of 2009 and $46.2 million was incurred in connection with the Companys normal on-going restructuring actions. The plans approved by the Company in April and August 2009 reflected managements assessment that adjustments to the Companys on-going cost structure were appropriate in light of lower demand in most of the Companys end markets resulting from the overall deterioration in global economic conditions that began in the latter half of 2008 and continued through 2009. These 2009 restructuring actions include employee-related and facility shut-down costs of $228.1 million and non-cash asset write-offs of $10.4 million. Cash expenditures for these restructuring activities are being funded with cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2009, cash payments of $106.5 million related to these actions have been made. The Companys 2009 restructuring activities generated approximately $50 million pre-tax savings during 2009 and the Company expects to realize approximately $170 million of incremental year-over-year pre-tax savings during 2010 associated with these restructuring activities.  

During the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring and other related charges totaling $82.0 million ($61.5 million net of tax, or $0.18 per diluted share) relating to restructuring actions designed to better position the Companys cost base in light of the deterioration in global economic conditions. These charges included

Table of Contents 

 cash employee-related and facility shut-down costs of $76 million and non-cash asset write-offs of $6 million. All required cash payments related to the actions have been made as of December 31, 2009. The 2008 restructuring activities generated approximately $100 million of pre-tax savings during 2009 and the Company expects comparable annual savings in future years.  

Refer to Note 17 to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these restructuring activities. The impact of these restructuring costs on each of the Companys reportable segments is discussed in the Results of Operations - Business Segments below.  

Outlook  

While differences exist among the Companys businesses, the year-over-year sales declines during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the year-over-year sales declines during each of the first three quarters of 2009, due in part to an improving global economic environment as well as easier year-over-year comparisons. The improved rates of decline were most evident in the product identification, test and measurement, dental and life sciences and diagnostics businesses. As economic conditions continue to stabilize, and providing no unforeseen, significant deterioration in general economic conditions occurs, the Company expects modest overall sales growth during 2010 as compared to 2009. The restructuring actions undertaken by the Company in 2008 and 2009 targeted at reducing the Companys ongoing cost structure are expected to positively impact the Companys earnings and operating cash flow in 2010 and future periods. The additional operating cash flow generated by these cost savings will continue to be strategically deployed to strengthen the Companys competitive position and accelerate its sales and earnings potential.  

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased 12% compared to 2008. Sales from existing businesses declined 12% on a year-over-year basis. The impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 2.0% as the U.S. dollar was, on average, stronger against other major currencies during 2009 as compared to exchange rate levels during 2008. Recently acquired businesses provided sales growth of approximately 2.0%. In this report, references to sales from existing businesses refers to sales calculated according to GAAP but excluding (1) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition, and (2) the impact of currency translation. References to sales or operating profit attributable to acquisitions or recently acquired businesses refer to sales or operating profit, as applicable, from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition. The portion of revenue attributable to currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) and (b) the period-to-period change in revenue (excluding acquisition sales) after applying current period foreign exchange rates to the prior year period.  

Operating profit margins were 13.8% in the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 14.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins during 2009 is primarily a result of lower sales volumes in 2009 compared to 2008, as well as restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the level incurred during 2008 which reduced operating profit margin comparisons by 115 basis points on a year-over-year basis. In addition, the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 20 basis points. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Companys 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins. The gain recognized during 2009 in connection with the Align litigation settlement also favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 75 basis points. In addition, accounting charges recorded in 2008 associated with recording the fair value of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in connection with the November 2007 acquisition of Tektronix (net of comparable acquisition-related charges recorded in 2009) favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 10 basis points. The Company anticipates that the dilutive effect of acquisitions and acquisition-related accounting charges are factors that will continue to adversely impact operating profit margins in future periods, while the impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and the Companys ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses are factors that will continue to benefit operating profit margins in future periods.

2009 COMPARED TO 2008  

The year-over-year decline in sales during 2009 is principally attributable to declines in the segments test and measurement lines of business. Price increases contributed 1.5% sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the changes in sales from existing businesses.  

Operating profit margins decreased 190 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during 2009, as well as 145 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008. The dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses also adversely impacted operating profit margins on a year-over-year basis by 45 basis points. Accounting charges incurred in 2008 associated with recording the fair value of inventory and deferred revenue acquired in connection with the November 2007 acquisition of Tektronix (net of comparable acquisition-related charges recorded in 2009) favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 70 basis points. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Companys 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses also partially offset the reductions in operating profit margins.  

Overview of Businesses within Professional Instrumentation Segment  

Environmental. Sales from the segments environmental businesses, representing 57% of segment sales for 2009, were essentially flat as compared to 2008. Sales from existing businesses decreased reported sales by 1.0% and the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 2.5%. Growth of 3.5% related to recently acquired businesses offset these sales declines.  

Sales from existing businesses in the segments water quality businesses during 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008. A mid-teens growth rate in the business ultraviolet water treatment product line and a mid-single digit growth rate in the industrial water treatment product line offset low-single digit sales declines in the business laboratory and process instrumentation product line. Growth rates in the ultraviolet water treatment product line reflect strength in demand for municipal wastewater applications, as well as shipments related to a significant drinking water treatment plant project that commenced in 2009 and is expected to be substantially completed during 2010. In the business laboratory and process instrumentation product line and associated consumables, general economic conditions adversely impacted demand in all major geographies with the exception of China, where revenues grew at a low double-digit rate during 2009.  

Sales from existing businesses in the retail petroleum equipment business during 2009 declined at a low-single digit rate as compared to 2008. Strong North American sales of the business point-of-sale retail and payment solution product offerings that are being driven in part by regulatory requirements were more than offset by lower demand for dispensing equipment, primarily in Europe, and service offerings. Lower demand for the business automatic tank gauge product offerings and leak detection systems also adversely impacted year-over-year comparisons. The decline in demand for the business leak detection systems was partially attributable to a significant project in 2008 that did not repeat in 2009.  

Test & Measurement. Sales in the segments test and measurement businesses, representing 43% of segment sales for 2009, declined 22.0% as compared to 2008. Sales from existing businesses decreased reported sales by 24.0%, while the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 1.0%. Sales growth of 3.0% related to recently acquired businesses partially offset these declines.  

Soft demand across all instrumentation related product lines, attributable to general economic conditions and inventory reductions by distributors, drove sales declines during 2009. While year-over-year sales declined during each quarter during 2009, the rate of decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year primarily due to the adverse impact of inventory level reductions in the distribution channel that were largely completed by the end of the third quarter. Year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter were also favorably impacted by the decline in demand that commenced in the fourth quarter 2008 resulting in an easier comparison. Sales declined in all significant geographic regions. Year-over-year sales in the network and communication businesses declined at a lower rate than the instrumentation business primarily as a result of positive performance in the network management solutions businesses which benefited from the competition among mobile telecommunication providers to expand coverage, services and performance of their networks.

2008 COMPARED TO 2007  

Segment sales for Professional Instrumentation increased 37.5% for 2008 as compared to 2007. Sales growth was experienced in both of the segments strategic lines of business during the year, with the majority of the growth coming from acquisitions. Price increases accounted for approximately 2.0% sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses.  

Fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Professional Instrumentation segment by 60 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, the dilutive impact of recently acquired businesses reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 295 basis points, including the adverse impact of acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue fair value charges recorded related to the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company also incurred Tektronix-related charges in 2007 associated with acquired in-process research and development that affected year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 170 basis points.  

Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales increased during 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily as a result of the increase in amortization expense associated with the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Tektronix acquisition.  

Overview of Businesses within Professional Instrumentation Segment  

Environmental. Sales from the Companys environmental businesses, representing approximately 51% of segment sales for 2008, increased 15.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 6.5% growth while acquisitions accounted for 7.5% growth and currency translation accounted for 1.5% growth.  

The segments water quality businesses experienced high-single digit revenue growth from existing businesses in 2008 as compared to 2007. This growth was primarily a result of strong laboratory and process sales, reflecting in part the results of increased sales force investments and penetration into emerging markets. Growth in sales was experienced in all major geographic regions with particular strength in Asia where sales increased at a double digit rate. Also contributing to the year-over-year growth was increased demand by municipalities for the businesses ultraviolet disinfection water treatment product offerings which experienced a mid-teens sales growth rate.  

The retail petroleum equipment business experienced mid-single digit revenue growth from existing businesses in 2008 as compared to 2007. This growth was primarily driven by strong sales of payment and point of sale retail and payment solution product offerings offset by a decline in dispensing equipment sales primarily in North America and Europe. An increase in demand for the business vapor recovery products in North America also contributed to the year-over-year sales growth, primarily related to an enhanced vapor recovery product that received regulatory approval and launched during the fourth quarter of 2008.  

Test and Measurement. Sales from the Companys test and measurement businesses, representing approximately 49% of segment sales for 2008, grew 70% compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses were essentially flat while acquisitions accounted for 68.0% growth and currency translation accounted for approximately 2.0% growth.  

Sales growth from existing businesses was driven primarily by performance during the first nine months of 2008 as a result of strong sales of the business thermography and precision measurement product offerings as well as strong growth from investments in emerging markets. While demand for the business thermography products continued to increase as compared to 2007 during the fourth quarter, demand slowed for the business traditional industrial digital hand-held instruments and precision measurement products resulting in a mid-single digit rate sales decline in the quarter and offsetting the growth experienced in the first nine months. In addition, the sales decline in the fourth quarter of 2008 is a result of reductions of inventory in the distribution channel as well as the impact of currency exchange rate volatility on customer demand in certain emerging markets. Sales also declined throughout 2008 in the business enterprise network performance management line of business as a result of generally lower telecommunications demand and slower information technology spending by customers.

2009 COMPARED TO 2008  

During 2009, sales growth in the segments acute care diagnostic and pathology diagnostic businesses was more than offset by sales declines in the segments life sciences instrumentation and dental businesses. Price increases contributed 1.0% sales growth during 2009 and are reflected as a component of the change in sales from existing businesses.  

Operating profit margins increased 130 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The gain recognized during 2009 in connection with the Align litigation settlement favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 270 basis points. Restructuring costs incurred during 2009 in excess of the levels incurred during 2008 reduced operating profit margins by 105 basis points on a year-over-year basis and the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses adversely impacted operating profit margin comparisons by 15 basis points. The adoption of the new business combination accounting standard, requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after December 31, 2008, also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 55 basis points. While the year-over-year sales declines diminished leverage of the segments fixed cost base, the 2009 cost savings attributable to the Companys 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses offset this adverse impact.  

Overview of Businesses within Medical Technologies Segment  

Sales in the segments existing acute care diagnostics business grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. Continued strong aftermarket consumables sales related to the business installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation drove the majority of the growth during 2009. Increased sales of the business

 cardiac marking instrument also contributed to the year-over-year growth and are expected to further benefit sales in 2010. Sales grew at a double-digit rate in China and the emerging economies of Latin America during 2009, while combined Europe and North America sales were flat.  

Sales in the segments existing life science instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses declined at a low-single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. Sales growth attributable to pathology diagnostic instrumentation and associated consumable products, primarily outside of North America, was more than offset by sales declines attributable to lower demand for compound and stereo microscopy equipment primarily in Europe and North America. Lower demand for microscopy equipment resulted largely from lower capital spending in the Companys customer base throughout 2009. While year-over-year sales in the life sciences instrumentation business declined in each quarter during 2009, the rate of year-over-year decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year as economic stimulus funding, primarily in Japan, began to favorably impact the business. North American stimulus funding did not significantly benefit the business in 2009, but is expected to positively impact the Companys results in 2010.  

Sales in the segments existing dental businesses declined at a high-single digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. Sales in the dental consumables business during 2009 were essentially flat as compared to 2008. Increased sales of orthodontia and infection control products during 2009 were offset by weaker demand for implants, endodontic products and general dentistry consumables. Lower capital spending by customers and inventory reductions in certain distribution channels drove year-over-year sales declines at a mid-teen rate in the dental technologies businesses. While year-over-year sales in the dental technologies business declined in each quarter during 2009, the rate of year-over-year decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved compared to the first three quarters of the year due to strong sales of treatment units in Europe, as well as easier year-over-year comparisons due to a large stocking order for imaging equipment that occurred in the third quarter 2008. The Companys acquisition of PaloDEx, a leading manufacturer of dental imaging products, in the fourth quarter of 2009 will provide additional sales growth in the Companys dental imaging business in 2010.  

2008 COMPARED TO 2007  

Segment sales for Medical Technologies increased 9.5% for 2008 as compared to 2007. Sales growth was primarily driven by the segments acute care diagnostics, life sciences instrumentation and pathology diagnostics businesses. Price increases accounted for approximately 1.0% sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses.  

The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Medical Technologies segment by 80 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, the dilutive impact of recently acquired businesses reduced 2008 operating profit margins by 40 basis points. A decline in demand for certain products in the dental technologies business, in addition to increased sales force investment and research and development costs within the life sciences business, also adversely impacted year-over-year operating margin profit comparisons.  

Overview of Businesses within Medical Technologies Segment  

Revenues in the segments acute care diagnostics business grew at mid-single digit rate in 2008 as compared to 2007. The year-over-year growth was primarily attributable to strong aftermarket consumables sales for the business installed base of acute care diagnostic instrumentation, sales of the business compact version of its blood gas analysis instrument as well as sales resulting from the launch of the business AQT cardiac marker during 2008. Sales growth was experienced in all major geographic regions during the year. Particularly strong growth in emerging markets during the first nine months of the year moderated during the fourth quarter as a result of currency exchange rate volatility and economic uncertainty.  

The segments life science instrumentation business experienced high-single digit revenue growth in 2008 as compared to 2007. Continued strong sales of the business pathology diagnostics instrumentation and consumables offerings as well as compound microscopy product offerings drove the majority of this growth. All major geographic regions experienced growth.

Table of Contents 

The segments dental business revenue in 2008 was essentially flat as compared to 2007. Revenues in the dental technologies business grew at a mid-single digit rate through the first nine months of 2008 primarily driven by strong demand for imaging equipment. However, a significant decline in demand in the fourth quarter for the majority of the products in the dental technologies business, including imaging equipment, more than offset this earlier growth resulting in low-single digit sales declines for the year. The decline in demand is primarily attributable to customer decisions to cancel or delay capital spending as well as inventory reductions in certain distribution channels. Offsetting the 2008 sales declines in the dental technologies business was low-single digit growth in the dental consumables business. Sales growth in the dental consumables businesses was primarily due to strong sales of general dentistry consumables and increased demand for endodontic and infection control products, offset by lower demand in the orthodontia product line.  

INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES  

Businesses in the Industrial Technologies segment manufacture products and sub-systems that are typically incorporated by customers and systems integrators into production and packaging lines, as well as incorporated by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) into various end-products. Many of the businesses also provide services to support their products, including helping customers integrate and install the products and helping ensure product uptime. The Industrial Technologies segment encompasses two strategic lines of business, product identification and motion, and two focused niche businesses, aerospace and defense, and sensors and controls. These businesses produce and sell product identification equipment and consumables; precision motion control equipment; monitoring, sensing and control devices; and aerospace safety devices and defense articles. In the third quarter of 2007, the Company disposed of the power quality businesses that were part of this segment and all 2007 segment results have been adjusted to exclude the results of these discontinued operations.

2009 COMPARED TO 2008  

Sales declines in a majority of the segments businesses during 2009 more than offset sales growth of approximately 1.5% related to price increases which are reflected as a component of the decrease in sales from existing businesses.  

37  

Table of Contents 

Operating profit margins in the segment declined 160 basis points in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from lower sales volumes during 2009, as well as 75 basis points of incremental restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008. The adoption of the new business combination accounting standard, requiring the expensing of transaction costs for pending and completed acquisitions after December 31, 2008, combined with the dilutive effect of recently acquired businesses, also reduced operating profit margins for 2009 by 10 basis points. Cost savings realized in 2009 attributable to the Companys 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and ongoing efforts to reduce material costs and other operating expenses partially offset these negative factors.  

Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment  

Product Identification. Sales from the segments product identification businesses, representing approximately 29% of segment sales during 2009, declined 10.5% as compared to 2008. Sales from existing businesses decreased reported sales by 8.0%, while the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 4.0%. Sales growth of 1.5% related to recently acquired businesses partially offset these declines.  

Sales declines from existing businesses during 2009 resulted primarily from weak demand for core marking and coding equipment due to lower capital spending by customers as a result of general economic conditions. Sales of consumable products associated with the businesses installed base of marking and coding equipment also declined on a year-over-year basis but not as significantly as equipment sales. During the fourth quarter of 2009, equipment sales increased on a year-over-year basis primarily due to emerging market growth. Flat consumable product sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008 were an improvement to year-over-year consumable sales declines during the first three quarters of the year. Sales in the China market grew during the second half of 2009, resulting in low-single digit sales growth for the full year. Continued capital project freezes by the United States Postal Service contributed to year-over-year sales declines in the business integrated scanning system product line.  

Motion. Sales from the segments motion businesses, representing approximately 27% of segment sales during 2009, declined 33.5% as compared to 2008. Sales from existing businesses decreased reported sales by 30.0%, while the impact of currency translation decreased reported sales by 3.5%.  

Sales from existing businesses declined as a result of weak demand for most of the businesses product offerings attributable to the recessionary economic conditions that existed throughout 2009. While year-over-year sales in the motion businesses declined in each quarter during 2009, the rate of year-over-year decline during the fourth quarter of 2009 improved slightly compared to the second and third quarters of the year, due to improvements in demand for certain product offerings and the absence of inventory reductions experienced in early 2009 in the business distribution channels.  

Focused Niche Businesses. Sales in the segments niche businesses declined at a low-double digit rate during 2009 as compared to 2008. The Companys sensors and controls business saw modest improvement in certain end markets during the fourth quarter 2009 as compared to the first nine months of 2009. Demand in the Companys aerospace and defense businesses softened in the second half of 2009, however, primarily due to declines in demand in the commercial aviation end markets.  

2008 COMPARED TO 2007  

Segment sales for Industrial Technologies increased 3.5% for 2008 as compared to 2007. Sales growth experienced for the majority of the year in the segments motion and niche aerospace and defense and sensors lines of business was partially offset by sales declines experienced in the segments product identification line of business, primarily in the second half of 2008. Price increases accounted for approximately 2.0% sales growth which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses.  

The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Industrial Technologies segment by 70 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. In addition, gains recorded in 2007 due to the collection of indemnification proceeds related to a lawsuit and from the sale of real estate adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 45 basis points. Operating profit margin improvements during 2008, primarily relating to cost savings initiatives implemented beginning in late 2007, partially offset these adverse impacts.

Overview of Businesses within Industrial Technologies Segment  

Product Identification. The product identification businesses accounted for approximately 27% of segment sales in 2008. Sales from the segments product identification businesses decreased 1.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses accounted for a 3.5% decline in sales while currency translation contributed 1.5% to revenue growth and acquisitions contributed 0.5% to revenue growth in 2008.  

Through the first nine months of 2008, sales growth driven by increased demand for both consumable products and services associated with the installed base of marking and coding equipment had partially offset a decline in equipment sales. Further weakening of equipment demand during the fourth quarter, primarily in North America and Europe, resulted in double-digit year-over-year declines in equipment sales during the quarter as customers cancelled or delayed purchases. The declines in equipment sales more than offset the sales growth from consumables and services experienced throughout the majority of 2008. In addition, sales in the integrated scanning system product line declined throughout 2008 due to lower capital expenditures by the United States Postal Service and the timing of completion of various large projects for other large parcel post and retail customers.  

Motion Sales in the segments motion businesses, representing approximately 34% of segment sales in 2008, increased 4.0% over 2007. Sales from existing businesses accounted for 1.0% growth while currency translation accounted for 3.0% growth during 2008. There were no acquisitions in the motion businesses in 2008 or 2007.  

Sales growth from existing businesses during 2008 was primarily driven by demand for custom motors and drives, particularly in the elevator application, flat panel display and aerospace and defense end markets. Largely offsetting this growth was weakness in demand for the business standard motors and drives product offerings throughout the year, and in particular during the fourth quarter, primarily in North America and Europe. In addition, during the fourth quarter, demand for products supporting the semiconductor and electronic assembly end markets, as well as other industrial applications, declined at levels in excess of the declines experienced during the first nine months of the year.  

Focused Niche Businesses. Revenues in the segments existing niche businesses grew at a mid-single digit rate during 2008 as compared to 2007, driven primarily by high-single digit sales growth in the segments aerospace and defense businesses and low-single digit sales growth in the segments sensors and controls businesses. Sales growth from the sensors and controls business primarily occurred during the first nine months of 2008 as demand weakened during the fourth quarter resulting in essentially flat segment sales for the fourth quarter of 2008 as compared to the comparable period of 2007.  

TOOLS & COMPONENTS  

The Tools & Components segment is one of the largest producers and distributors of general purpose and specialty mechanics hand tools. Other products manufactured by the businesses in this segment include toolboxes and storage devices; diesel engine retarders; wheel service equipment and drill chucks.

Components of Sales Growth (Decline)  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2009 COMPARED TO 2008  

Sales declined in both the mechanics hand tools business and the segments niche businesses during 2009 as compared to 2008. Price increases did not appreciably impact segment results during 2009.  

Operating profit margins in the segment were 40 basis points lower during 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating profit margins resulted primarily from 130 basis points of incremental year-over-year restructuring costs incurred during 2009 compared to 2008. In addition, a gain recorded in 2008 from the settlement of an insurance claim related to a 2007 plant fire adversely impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons. Lower year-over-year average commodity costs, cost savings attributable to the Companys 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities and improved productivity in the business manufacturing facilities partially offset these negative year-over-year factors.  

Overview of Businesses within the Tools & Components Segment  

Mechanics hand tools sales from existing businesses, representing approximately 75% of segment sales, declined 11% during 2009 as compared to 2008. The year-over-year decline in sales is primarily a result of generally weak North American demand in the retail, industrial and mobile tool markets relating to general economic conditions. Modest growth in the China domestic market during 2009 partially offset weak North American demand.  

Sales in the segments niche businesses declined approximately 35% during 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to weak end market demand. While demand was weak throughout 2009, the rate of sales decline during the second half of 2009 was not as pronounced as the rate of sales decline in the first half of 2009, in part because of easier year-over-year comparisons as these businesses began experiencing revenue declines in mid-2008.

2008 COMPARED TO 2007  

Price increases accounted for approximately 2.0% sales growth on a year-over-year basis which is reflected as a component of the sales from existing businesses.  

The fourth quarter 2008 restructuring activities adversely impacted operating profit margins in the Tools and Components segment by 30 basis points in 2008 as compared to 2007. Elevated commodity costs and lower overall sales volumes in the mechanics hand tools business also adversely impacted operating profit margins. A 2008 gain from the settlement of an insurance claim related to a 2007 plant fire, coupled with the impact of charges recorded in 2007 associated with the fire, favorably impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons by 50 basis points. Commodity costs declined significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008.  

Overview of Businesses within the Tools & Components Segment  

Mechanics hand tools sales, representing approximately 69% of segment sales in 2008, declined 5.5% in 2008 compared to 2007. Sales from existing businesses declined 6.0% during 2008, offset by a 0.5% positive impact as a result of foreign currency translation. The sales decline is primarily attributable to weak North American demand in both the retail, mobile and industrial hand tools end markets. Partially offsetting the weak North American demand was sales growth in the Asian market, primarily in the first half of 2008, as the rate of growth in the region slowed during the second half of the year.  

The segments niche businesses experienced a modest sales increase during 2008 as compared to 2007. Higher customer demand in the segments engine retarder business, which rebounded from the impact of regulatory changes that resulted in reduced 2007 sales levels, were largely offset by lower demand in the segments other niche businesses during year, with particularly lower demand in the fourth quarter.  

GROSS PROFIT  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Gross profit margins for 2009 increased 40 basis points from 2008. Cost savings related to 2008 and 2009 restructuring activities primarily drove the year-over-year improvements in gross profit margin from 2008 to 2009. Lower year-over-year commodity costs also contributed to the improvement, as costs for several types of raw materials increased sharply in 2008 before declining late in 2008 and into 2009. Lower overall sales volumes during 2009 as compared to 2008 diminished the leverage of the Companys fixed cost base and partially offset these positive factors. In addition, costs incurred associated with year-over-year incremental 2009 restructuring activities adversely impacted gross profit margins by 65 basis points.  

Gross profit margins for 2008 increased 110 basis points from 2007. Included in the 2008 gross profit margins is $33 million (25 basis points) of restructuring and other related costs. The increase in gross profit margins over 2007 is primarily a result of leverage on increased sales volume, particularly in higher-margin consumable oriented businesses, the impact of cost-saving initiatives that began in late 2007 and generally higher gross profit margins in businesses recently acquired, primarily Tektronix. The impact on gross margins of higher commodity costs prevalent through the majority of 2008 was partially mitigated by price increases implemented throughout the Company.

OPERATING EXPENSES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The year-over-year increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from 2008 to 2009 is primarily due to reduced leverage of the Companys cost base caused by lower sales volumes during 2009 as compared to 2008. Incremental year-over-year costs associated with 2009 restructuring activities adversely impacted selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales by 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis, although the 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions have generated year-over-year cost savings that partially offset these negative factors.  

Research and development expenses (consisting principally of internal and contract engineering personnel costs) as a percentage of sales were flat during 2009 as compared to 2008. The Company continues to invest in new product development within all of its businesses, with particular emphasis on the medical technologies, test and measurement, environmental and product identification businesses.  

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for 2008 increased 170 basis points from 2007. Included in the 2008 selling, general and administrative expenses is $49 million (40 basis points) of restructuring and other related costs. Other increases in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales are primarily associated with recently acquired businesses and their higher relative operating expense structures. Increased spending to fund growth opportunities throughout the Company, particularly in emerging markets, also contributed to the growth as a percentage of sales.  

Research and development expenses as a percentage of sales were approximately 20 basis points higher in 2008 as compared to 2007. The 2007 charge for acquired in-process research and development related to the Tektronix acquisition, as described below, impacted year-over-year comparisons by 75 basis points. The relatively higher research and development cost structures of recently acquired businesses, primarily Tektronix, and higher investment in research and development in the Medical Technologies segment were the primary drivers of these year-over-year increases.  

INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME  

For a description of the Companys outstanding indebtedness, please refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources  Financing Activities and Indebtedness below.  

Interest expense of $123 million in 2009 was $7.5 million lower than 2008 primarily as a result of lower average debt levels during 2009 as the Company deployed cash flows to repay a portion of its commercial paper borrowings. Interest attributable to the $750 million principal amount of 5.40% senior unsecured notes issued in March 2009 (as discussed below) partially offset the positive impact of the reduction in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Interest expense of $130 million in 2008 was approximately $20 million higher than 2007 as a result of higher average debt levels during 2008, primarily as a result of borrowings incurred in the fourth quarter 2007 to fund the acquisition of Tektronix.  

The Company recognized interest income of $5 million, $10 million and $6 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Interest income in 2009 was lower than interest income in 2008 as the lower interest rates on deposits  

42  

Table of Contents 

 in 2009 compared to 2008 more than offset higher average invested cash balances. Interest income during 2008 was higher than during 2007 as a result of higher average invested cash balances as less cash was deployed for acquisitions during 2008.  

INCOME TAXES  

General  

Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect managements assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the Companys financial statements. The Company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur.  

The Companys effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns (as discussed below), the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws. The Companys effective tax rate for 2009 differs from the United States federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the United States. No provisions for United States income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. The amount of United States income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the Company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings. As of December 31, 2009, the total amount of earnings planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States for which deferred taxes have not been provided was approximately $6.5 billion.  

The amount of income taxes the Company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities. Based on these reviews, the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit, reserves are adjusted as necessary. For a discussion of risks related to these and other tax matters, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Year-Over-Year Changes in Tax Provision and Effective Tax Rate  

The Companys effective tax rate related to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 19.2%, 24.7% and 25.8%, respectively.  

The Companys 2009 effective tax rate of 19.2% includes the impact of approximately $97.2 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, related to gains from the net reduction of reserves associated with the resolution of uncertain tax positions and discrete items. The impact of expensing transaction costs in accordance with the new business combination accounting standard, much of which are not deductible for income tax purposes, partially offset these beneficial factors.  

The Companys 2008 effective tax rate of 24.7% includes the impact of approximately $9.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to gains from the net reduction of reserves associated with uncertain tax positions and discrete items recorded primarily during the second quarter. The effective tax rate also reflects the impact of the continued growth in earnings outside of the United States. Refer to Note 14 in the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  

The effective tax rate for 2010 is expected to be approximately 25%.

INFLATION  

The effect of broad based inflation on the Companys operations was not significant in the twelve months ended December 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007.  

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT  

The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and credit risk, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. In addition, the Companys broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole.  

Interest Rate Risk  

A change in interest rates on long-term debt is assumed to impact the fair value of the Companys long-term debt but not our earnings or cash flow because the interest on the Companys long-term debt is fixed. As of December 31, 2009, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would decrease the fair value of the Companys fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt is primarily derived from its underlying common stock) by approximately $120 million. However, since the Company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed-rate instruments before their maturity, the impact of market interest rate fluctuations on the Companys long-term debt does not affect the Companys results of operations or stockholders equity.  

A change in interest rates on short-term debt impacts our earnings and cash flow, but not the fair value of the Companys short-term debt instruments because of their limited duration. As of December 31, 2009, the Companys short-term debt obligations relate primarily to U.S. dollar commercial paper borrowings, and as a result its primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. Refer to Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Companys outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2009. As these obligations mature, the Company anticipates issuing additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. In 2009, a 50% increase in average market interest rates on the Companys commercial paper borrowings would have increased the Companys interest expense by approximately $0.4 million. A 50% hypothetical fluctuation is used as the Companys actual commercial paper interest rates fluctuated near that amount during 2009.  

Currency Exchange Rate Risk 

The Company faces exchange rate risk from its investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Companys net investment in international subsidiaries, net of the translation effect of the Eurobonds, is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity. A 10% depreciation in major currencies, relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2009 (net of the translation effect of the Companys Eurobond Notes, as described below) would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately $500 million.  

The Company also faces exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States. Although the Company has a U.S. dollar functional currency for reporting purposes, it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a substantial portion of its costs are incurred, and sales are generated in foreign currencies. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the United States dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. 

44  

Table of Contents 

On average, the U.S. dollar strengthened against other major currencies during 2009. As a result, currency exchange rates decreased reported sales for 2009 by approximately 2.0% as compared to reported sales for 2008. The impact of currency exchange rates on reported sales on a year-over-year basis was more significant in the first half of 2009 as the U.S. dollar weakened against other major currencies during the second half of 2009 and ended the year at exchange rates lower than existed as of December 31, 2008. If the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2009 prevail throughout 2010, currency exchange rates will positively impact 2010 reported sales and operating results relative to the Companys performance in 2009. Additional weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would have a further positive impact on the Companys reported sales and results of operations. Any strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies would adversely impact the Companys sales and results of operations on an overall basis.  

The Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk. Therefore, both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales, profit, and assets and liabilities in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Eurobond Notes described below (which as of December 31, 2009 had outstanding borrowings in principal amount equivalent to $716 million) provide a natural hedge to a portion of the Companys European net asset position.  

Credit Risk  

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments, and trade accounts receivable. The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments. The Company places cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions throughout the world, and exposure is limited at any one institution. Although the Company does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, it does regularly monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds.  

In addition, concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the Companys customers. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial conditions and obtains collateral or other security when appropriate.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Management assesses the Companys liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities.  

The Companys ability to access the commercial paper market and the other capital markets has not been affected adversely by the recent uncertainty in the financial markets. The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and believes that its cash flow and other sources of liquidity, primarily its commercial paper program and committed credit facility, will be sufficient to allow it to continue investing in existing businesses and strategic acquisitions and maintain its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. For a discussion of risks related to the uncertainty in the financial markets and the global economy in general, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Overview of Cash Flows and Liquidity  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Operating cash flow from continuing operations, a key source of the Companys liquidity, decreased $58 million during 2009, or approximately 3%, as compared to 2008.  

       Funding for acquisitions constituted the most significant use of cash during 2009. The Company acquired fifteen businesses during 2009. Total consideration paid for these acquisitions was approximately $704 million in cash, net of cash acquired. In addition, the Company used approximately $67 million in cash for other investment opportunities.  

       The Company repaid approximately $470 million of debt (net of new borrowings, other than the proceeds from the March 2009 public debt offering) during 2009.  

46  

Table of Contents 

       The Companys restructuring activities used approximately $190 million in cash during 2009.  

       In March 2009, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due 2019. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were approximately $745 million. A portion of the net proceeds was used to repay a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper and the balance of the net proceeds is being used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions.  

       As of December 31, 2009, the Company held $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents. As discussed below in Recent Acquisition Activity, subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Company utilized $1.1 billion of cash on hand in connection with the completion of the AB Sciex and Molecular Devices acquisitions.  

Operating Activities  

The Company continues to generate substantial cash from operating activities and remains in a strong financial position, with resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short and long-term basis. Cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period as working capital needs and the timing of payments for items such as income taxes, restructuring activities, pension funding and other items impact reported cash flows.  

Operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $1.8 billion for 2009, a decrease of $58 million, or approximately 3% as compared to 2008. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to the decrease in earnings in 2009 as compared to 2008 and to a lesser extent attributable to the year-over-year incremental amount of cash paid related to the Companys restructuring activities. In addition, the Company voluntarily contributed $60 million to the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plan in 2009 while it made no contribution in 2008. The declines in operating cash flow were partially offset by improvements in operating working capital (defined by the Company as trade accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) which contributed $228 million of cash flow during 2009 as compared to contributing $108 million of cash flow during 2008. Operating working capital in 2009 benefited from increased collections of accounts receivable and reduced inventory levels associated with lower levels of business activity, partially offset by reductions in accounts payable as compared to 2008. A decline of approximately $100 million in tax payments during 2009 as compared to 2008 also partially offset the decline in operating cash flow.  

Operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $1.9 billion for 2008, an increase of $160 million, or approximately 9.5% as compared to 2007. Earnings growth of $104 million in addition to an increase of approximately $39 million in contributions from operating working capital as compared to 2007 contributed to the overall year-over-year increase in operating cash flows. The 2008 operating working capital contribution increased primarily due to strong collections of accounts receivable. Operating cash flows during 2008 also benefited approximately $83 million from year-over-year increases in stock compensation, depreciation and amortization charges which did not require the use of cash. In addition, non-cash acquisition related charges incurred related to acquired inventory and acquired deferred revenue in connection with the 2007 acquisition of Tektronix had a positive impact on operating cash flow comparisons. Approximately $100 million of additional income tax payments made in 2008 related to continuing operations as compared to 2007 partially offset these positive factors.  

In connection with the Companys restructuring activities, the Company records appropriate accruals for the costs of closing facilities, severing personnel and, in connection with acquisitions, integrating the acquired businesses into existing Company operations. Cash flows from operating activities are reduced by the amounts expended against the various accruals. During 2009, the Company paid approximately $161 million related to its 2009 and 2008 restructuring activities and approximately $28 million related to restructuring activities associated with acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2008. Please refer to Note 2 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about these expenditures.

Table of Contents 

Investing Activities  

Cash flows relating to investing activities consist primarily of cash used for acquisitions and capital expenditures and cash flows from divestitures of businesses or assets. Net cash used in investing activities was $943 million during 2009 compared to $567 million of net cash used in 2008. Gross capital spending of $189 million during 2009 was approximately $5 million less than gross capital spending during 2008. Capital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development and improving information technology systems. In 2010, the Company expects capital spending to approximate $225 million, though actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions.  

Net cash used in investing activities related to continuing operations was approximately $567 million in 2008 compared to approximately $3.4 billion in 2007. Gross capital spending increased $32 million in 2008 from 2007 levels to $194 million.  

As discussed below, the Company completed numerous business acquisitions and divestitures during 2009, 2008 and 2007. All of the acquisitions during this period have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Companys financial statements. This goodwill typically arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect a number of factors including the future earnings and cash flow potential of these businesses; the multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors at which similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers; the competitive nature of the process by which the Company acquired the business; and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations. For a discussion of other factors resulting in the recognition of goodwill see Notes 2 and 6 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.  

2009 Acquisitions/Divestitures  

The Company acquired fifteen businesses during 2009 for consideration of approximately $704 million in cash, net of cash acquired. Each company acquired manufactures products and/or provides services in the life sciences, dental, product identification, environmental or test and measurement markets. These businesses were acquired to complement existing units of the Medical Technologies, Professional Instrumentation and Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these fifteen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $430 million.  

In addition, during 2009 the Company divested five businesses or product lines for approximately $10 million of net cash proceeds. The divested businesses were part of the Industrial Technologies and Tools and Components segments and had aggregate annual revenues of approximately $53 million in 2009. The Company recorded no significant gain or loss, either individually or in the aggregate, associated with these divestitures. The Company is using the proceeds from these sales for general corporate purposes.  

2008 Acquisitions  

The Company acquired seventeen companies or product lines during 2008 for consideration of approximately $423 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired and $8 million of debt assumed. Each company acquired manufactures products and/or provides services in the life sciences, dental, product identification, environmental or test and measurement markets. These companies were acquired to complement existing units of the Medical Technologies, Industrial Technologies or Professional Instrumentation segments. The aggregate annual sales of these seventeen acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $325 million.  

2007 Acquisitions/Divestitures  

In November 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Tektronix, Inc. for total cash consideration of approximately $2.8 billion, including transaction costs and net of cash and debt acquired. The Company initially financed the acquisition of Tektronix through the issuance of commercial paper and available cash (including proceeds from the underwritten public offering of 6.9 million shares of Danaher common stock completed on

 November 2, 2007). Subsequent to the acquisition, the Company issued $500 million of 5.625% senior notes due 2018 in an underwritten public offering and used the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the Tektronix acquisition. Tektronix had revenues of approximately $1.1 billion in its most recent completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition.  

In July 2007, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of ChemTreat for a cash purchase price of $425 million including transaction costs. No cash was acquired in the transaction. The Company financed the acquisition primarily with proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and to a lesser extent from available cash. ChemTreat had revenues of approximately $200 million in its most recent completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition.  

In addition, the Company acquired ten other companies or product lines during 2007 for consideration of approximately $273 million in cash, including transaction costs and net of cash acquired, and $4 million of debt assumed. Each company acquired manufactures products and/or provides services in the test and measurement, dental technologies, product identification, sensors and controls or environmental instruments markets. These companies were all acquired to complement existing units of the Professional Instrumentation, Medical Technologies or Industrial Technologies segments. The aggregate annual sales of these ten acquired businesses at the time of their respective acquisitions, in each case based on the companys revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $123 million.  

In addition to the twelve 2007 acquisitions noted above, during the first quarter of 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining shares of Vision Systems Limited not owned by the Company as of December 31, 2006 for cash consideration of approximately $96 million.  

In July 2007, the Company completed the sale of its power quality business generating approximately $275 million of net cash proceeds. This business, which was part of the Industrial Technologies segment and designs and manufactures power quality and reliability products and services, had aggregate annual revenues of approximately $130 million in 2006. The Company used the proceeds from this sale for general corporate purposes, including debt reduction and acquisitions.  

Recent Acquisition Developments  

Subsequent to December 31, 2009, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of the Analytical Technologies division of MDS, which includes a 50% ownership position in Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex joint venture (AB SCIEX), a mass spectrometry business, and a 100% ownership position in the former Molecular Devices Corporation, a bioresearch and analytical instrumentation company. In a separate, but related transaction, the Company simultaneously completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership position in AB SCIEX from Life Technologies Corporation. The aggregate purchase price for the combined transactions was approximately $1.1 billion, including debt assumed and net of cash acquired. The Company funded the purchase price for this transaction from available cash on hand.  

Financing Activities and Indebtedness  

Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, common stock and notes, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, repayments of indebtedness, repurchases of common stock and payments of dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of $404 million during 2009 compared to $1.1 billion of cash used during 2008. The year-over-year change was primarily due to the proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 Notes (described below); lower repayments of borrowings during 2009 as compared to 2008; and the repurchase of shares of Danaher common stock pursuant to the Companys stock repurchase program during 2008.  

Total debt was $2.9 billion at December 31, 2009 compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2008. The Companys debt as of December 31, 2009 was as follows:  

       $180 million of outstanding U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper;  

49  

Table of Contents 

       $716 million (500 million) aggregate principal amount of 4.5% guaranteed Eurobond Notes due 2013 (Eurobond Notes);  

       $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% Senior Notes due 2018 (2018 Notes);  

       $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.4% Senior Notes due 2019 (2019 Notes);  

       $634 million of zero coupon Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2021 (LYONs); and  

       $153 million of other borrowings.  

For a discussion of the Companys debt as of December 31, 2009, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not have any credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of outstanding debt, except in connection with the change of control provisions described as follows. Under each of the Eurobond Notes, the 2018 Notes and the 2019 Notes, if the Company experiences a change of control and a rating downgrade of a specified nature within a specified period following the change of control, the Company will be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of the 2018 Notes and 2019 Notes, or the principal amount plus accrued interest in the case of Eurobond Notes. The Companys outstanding indentures and comparable instruments also contain customary covenants including, for example, limits on the incurrence of secured debt and sale/leaseback transactions. None of these covenants are considered restrictive to the Companys operations and as of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants. For a discussion of the risks related to our indebtedness, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Commercial Paper Program and Credit Facility  

The Company satisfies its short-term liquidity needs primarily through issuances of U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper. Under the Companys U.S. dollar and Euro commercial paper programs, the Company or a subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in aggregate principal amount not to exceed $4.0 billion. Since the Credit Facilities (described below) provide credit support for the program, the $1.525 billion of availability under the Credit Facilities has the practical effect of reducing from $4.0 billion to $1.525 billion the maximum amount of commercial paper that the Company can issue under the program. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount and have a maturity of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance. Borrowings under the program are available for general corporate purposes, including financing acquisitions. The Company classifies the borrowings under the commercial paper program as long-term borrowings in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and the ability, as supported by the availability of the Credit Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date.  

Credit support for part of the commercial paper program is provided by an unsecured $1.45 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility) that expires on April 25, 2012 and an unsecured $75 million multicurrency revolving credit facility that expires on May 3, 2010 (the Supplemental Credit Facility and together with the Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities). The Credit Facilities can also be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Under the Credit Facility, interest is based on, at the Companys option (1) a LIBOR-based formula that is dependent in part on the Companys credit rating, (2) a formula based on the higher (as of the date of determination) of Bank of Americas prime rate or the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (3) the rate of interest bid by a particular lender for a particular loan under the facility. Under the Supplemental Credit Facility, interest is based on, at the Companys option (1) a LIBOR-based formula, or (2) a formula based on the highest (as of the date of determination) of the lenders prime rate, the Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points or the LIBOR rate plus 100 basis points. Both of the Credit Facilities require the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus stockholders equity) as of the last day of each quarter of 0.65 to 1.00 or less. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was in compliance with this covenant. The availability of the Credit Facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the existing credit ratings of our commercial paper program. We expect to limit any borrowings under the Credit Facilities to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. The Company anticipates seeking a renewal of the term of the Supplemental Credit Facility from the lender prior to its scheduled expiration.

During 2009, the Company refinanced balances under its commercial paper program as they came due to maintain an outstanding balance throughout the year. During 2008, the Company utilized its commercial paper program to finance the repayment of the Companys 6.1% notes that matured in October 2008. Amounts outstanding under the Companys U.S. dollar commercial paper program as of December 31, 2009 had a weighted average interest rate of 0.2% and an average maturity of approximately 5 days.  

Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related costs of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Any downgrade in the Companys credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under the Companys commercial paper program and Credit Facility, and could limit or preclude the Companys ability to issue commercial paper. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available operating cash flow and our Credit Facilities to provide short-term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under our Credit Facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings.  

Other Long-Term Indebtedness  

In March 2009, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.40% senior unsecured notes due 2019. The notes were issued at 99.93% of their principal amount. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were approximately $745 million. A portion of the net proceeds were used to repay a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper with the balance of the net proceeds used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 40 basis points.  

In December 2007, the Company completed an underwritten public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2018. The net proceeds, after expenses and the underwriters discount, were approximately $493.4 million, which were used to repay a portion of the commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of Tektronix. The Company may redeem the notes at any time prior to their maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest plus 25 basis points.  

On July 21, 2006, a financing subsidiary of the Company issued the Eurobond Notes in a private placement outside the U.S. Payment obligations under these Eurobond Notes are guaranteed by the Company. The net proceeds of the offering, after the deduction of underwriting commissions but prior to the deduction of other issuance costs, were 496 million ($627 million based on exchange rates in effect at the time the offering closed) and were used to pay down a portion of the Companys outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The Company may redeem the notes upon the occurrence of specified, adverse changes in tax laws, or interpretations under such laws, at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed.  

In 2001, the Company issued $830 million (value at maturity) in LYONs. The net proceeds to the Company were $505 million, of which approximately $100 million was used to pay down debt and the balance was used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. The LYONs carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as described below). Holders of the LYONs may convert each $1,000 of principal amount at maturity into 14.5352 shares of Danaher common stock (in the aggregate for all LYONs, approximately 12.0 million shares of Danaher common stock) at any time on or before the maturity date of January 22, 2021. As of December 31, 2009, an aggregate of approximately 68,000 shares of Danaher common stock had been issued upon conversion of LYONs. As of December 31, 2009, the accreted value of the outstanding LYONs was lower than the traded market value of the underlying common stock issuable upon conversion. The Company may redeem all or a portion of the LYONs for cash at any time at scheduled redemption prices. Holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes for cash and/or Company common stock, at the Companys option, on January 22, 2011. The holders had a similar option to require the Company to purchase all or a portion of the notes as of January 22, 2004, which resulted in notes with an accreted value of $1.1 million being redeemed by the Company for cash.  

Under the terms of the LYONs, the Company will pay contingent interest to the holders of LYONs during any six month period from January 23 to July 22 and from July 23 to January 22 if the average market price of a LYON for a  

51  

Table of Contents 

 specified measurement period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price and accrued original issue discount for such LYON. The amount of contingent interest to be paid with respect to any quarterly period is equal to the higher of either 0.0315% of the bonds average market price during the specified measurement period or the amount of the common stock dividend paid during such quarterly period multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon conversion of a LYON. The Company paid approximately $1.1 million of contingent interest on the LYONs for the year ended December 31, 2009. Except for the contingent interest described above, the Company will not pay interest on the LYONs prior to maturity.  

Shelf Registration Statement  

The Company has a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that registers an indeterminate amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, depositary shares, purchase contracts and units for future issuance.  

Stock Repurchase Program  

On April 21, 2005, the Companys Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 10 million shares of the Companys common stock from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. There is no expiration date for the Companys repurchase program. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by the Companys management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with the Companys equity compensation plans (including any successor plans) and for other corporate purposes.  

The Company did not repurchase any shares of Company common stock during 2009. During 2008, the Company repurchased 1.38 million shares of Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $74 million. During 2007, the Company repurchased 1.64 million of shares of the Company common stock in open market transactions at a cost of $117 million. The 2008 and 2007 repurchases were funded from available cash and from proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. At December 31, 2009, the Company had 1,977,566 shares remaining for stock repurchases under the existing Board authorization. The Company expects to fund any further repurchases using the Companys available cash balances or proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper.  

Dividends  

During the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company increased its regular quarterly dividend from $0.03 to $0.04 by declaring a dividend of $0.04 per share that was paid on January 26, 2010 to holders of record on December 31, 2009. Aggregate cash payments for dividends during 2009 were approximately $42 million.  

Cash and Cash Requirements  

The Company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs, capital expenditures and acquisitions, to pay interest and service debt, fund its restructuring activities and pension plans as required, pay dividends to shareholders and repurchase shares of the Companys common stock. The Company generally intends to use available cash and internally generated funds to meet these cash requirements and may borrow under existing commercial paper programs or the Credit Facilities or, subject to availability, access the capital markets as needed for liquidity. As of December 31, 2009, the Company held $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents that were invested in highly liquid investment grade debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less with an average weighted annual interest rate of 0.4%. Of this amount, approximately $1.5 billion was held outside the United States.  

The Companys cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside the United States. The Company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. Wherever possible, cash management is centralized and intra-company financing is used to provide working capital to the Companys operations. Most of the cash balances held outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States, but, under current law, would potentially be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits.

The provisions of the U.S. Pension Protection Act of 2006, enacted in August 2006 changed the minimum funding requirements for the Companys U.S. defined benefit pension plan beginning in 2009. During 2009, the Company voluntarily contributed $60 million to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan and approximately $34 million to its non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. During 2010, the Companys cash contribution requirements are expected to be approximately $24 million for its U.S. plan, however, the ultimate amounts to be contributed depend upon, among other things, underlying asset returns. The Company expects to contribute approximately $34 million in employer contributions and unfunded benefit payments to the non-U.S. plans in 2010.  

Contractual Obligations  

The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of the Companys contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 under (1) long-term debt obligations, (2) leases, (3) purchase obligations and (4) other long-term liabilities reflected on the Companys balance sheet under GAAP. The amounts presented in the table below do not reflect $503 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on unrecognized tax benefits.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) As described in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (b) Amounts do not include interest payments. Interest on long-term debt and capital lease obligations is reflected in a separate line in the table.  

 (c) Interest payments on long-term debt are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2009. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates.  

 (d) As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, certain leases require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises. These future costs are not included in the schedule above.  

 (e) Consist of agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Company and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.  

 (f) Primarily consist of obligations under product service and warranty policies and allowances, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs, self-insurance and litigation claims, post-retirement benefits, certain pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities (excluding unrecognized tax benefits) and deferred compensation obligations. The timing of cash flows associated with these obligations are based upon managements estimates over the terms of these arrangements and are largely based upon historical experience.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The following table sets forth, by period due or year of expected expiration, as applicable, a summary of off-balance sheet commercial commitments of the Company.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Standby letters of credit and performance bonds are generally issued to secure the Companys obligations under short-term contracts to purchase raw materials and components and for performance under specific sales agreements. Guarantees are generally issued in connection with certain transactions with vendors, suppliers, and financing counterparties and governmental entities.  

Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company has from time to time divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, the Company often provides representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, environmental matters or tax matters. The Company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions and has not included any such items in the table above, but does not believe that any such liability will have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In addition, as a result of these divestitures, as well as restructuring activities, certain properties leased by the Company have been sublet to third parties. In the event any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, the Company would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. The Company believes that the financial risk of default by such sub-lessors is individually and in the aggregate not material to the Companys financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  

In the normal course of business, the Company periodically enters into agreements that require it to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the Companys products or claims alleging that Company products infringe third-party intellectual property. The Company cannot estimate its maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions and has not accrued any liabilities in its consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in our contractual commitments table above. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification obligations.  

The Companys Certificate of Incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made, or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director or officer of the Company, or by reason of serving at the request of the Company as a director or officer of any other entity, subject to limited exceptions. Danahers Amended and Restated By-laws provide for similar indemnification rights. In addition, Danaher has executed with each of its directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement which provides for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which Danaher has agreed to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding. While the Company maintains insurance for this type of liability, a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage.

Legal Proceedings  

Please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for information regarding certain litigation matters.  

In addition to the litigation matters noted under Item 1. Business  Regulatory Matters  Environmental, Health & Safety, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar proceedings incidental to its business. These lawsuits primarily involve claims for damages arising out of the use of the Companys products and services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition related matters. The Company may also become subject to lawsuits as a result of past or future acquisitions or as a result of liabilities retained from, or representations, warranties or indemnities provided in connection with, divested businesses. Some of these lawsuits may include claims for punitive and consequential, as well as compensatory damages. Based upon the Companys experience, current information and applicable law, it does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its cash flows, financial position or results of operations.  

While the Company maintains workers compensation, property, cargo, automobile, aviation, crime, fiduciary, product, general liability, and directors and officers liability insurance (and has acquired rights under similar policies in connection with certain acquisitions) that it believes cover a portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. In addition, while the Company believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may also be insufficient or unavailable to cover such losses. The Company maintains third party insurance policies up to certain limits to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. For general liability risk (which includes product liability) and most other insured risks, the Company purchases outside insurance coverage only for severe losses (stop loss insurance) and must establish and maintain reserves with respect to amounts within the self-insured retention.  

The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company periodically assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and if appropriate, recognizes a reserve for these contingencies. These reserves consist of specific reserves for individual claims and additional amounts for anticipated developments of these claims as well as for incurred but not yet reported claims. The specific reserves for individual known claims are quantified with the assistance of legal counsel and outside risk insurance professionals where appropriate. In addition, outside risk insurance professionals assist in the determination of reserves for incurred but not yet reported claims through evaluation of the Companys specific loss history, actual claims reported, and industry trends among statistical and other factors. Reserve estimates are adjusted as additional information regarding a claim becomes known. While the Company actively pursues financial recoveries from insurance providers, it does not recognize any recoveries until realized or until such time as a sustained pattern of collections is established related to historical matters of a similar nature and magnitude. The Company believes the liability recorded for such risk insurance reserves as of December 31, 2009 is adequate, but due to judgments inherent in the reserve process it is possible the ultimate costs will differ from this estimate. If the risk insurance reserves established are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Companys net earnings. Please see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the amount of our accruals for self-insurance and litigation liability.  

For a discussion of additional risks related to existing and potential legal proceedings, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Managements discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Company bases these estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and judgments.  

The Company believes the following accounting policies are most critical to an understanding of its financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, refer to Note 1 in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Accounts receivable. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the Companys customers to make required payments. The Company estimates its anticipated losses from doubtful accounts based on historical collection history as well as by specifically reserving for known doubtful accounts. Estimating losses from doubtful accounts is inherently uncertain because the amount of such losses depends substantially on the financial condition of the Companys customers, and the Company typically has limited visibility as to the specific financial state of its customers. The uncertain conditions in the global economy and credit markets have heightened the uncertainties related to customers ability to pay. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate beyond estimates, and impair their ability to make payments, the Company would be required to write off additional accounts receivable balances, which would adversely impact the Companys net earnings and financial condition.  

Inventories. The Company records inventory at the lower of cost or market value. The Company estimates the market value of its inventory based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Estimating the market value of inventory is inherently uncertain because levels of demand, technological advances and pricing competition in many of the Companys markets can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to circumstances beyond the Companys control. As a result, such fluctuations can be difficult to predict. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, the Company could be required to reduce the value of its inventory, which would adversely impact the Companys net earnings and financial condition.  

Acquired intangibles. The Companys business acquisitions typically result in the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charges that the Company may incur. In accordance with accounting standards related to business combinations, goodwill amortization ceased effective January 1, 2002, however, amortization of certain identifiable intangible assets, primarily consisting of customer relationships and acquired technology, continues over the estimated useful lives of the identified asset. The Company is required, on at least an annual basis (the first day of the Companys fiscal fourth quarter), to calculate the fair value of each of its reporting units and compare the calculated fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, this is an impairment indicator which necessitates additional analysis to determine if the reporting units goodwill has been impaired. If circumstances or events occur prior to the date of the required annual assessment that indicate the potential diminution of fair value of a reporting unit, the Company performs an impairment analysis at the time of such change in circumstance or event. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market based approach. The Company estimates fair value based on EBITDA multiples determined by current trading market multiples of earnings for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Companys reporting units in addition to market available precedent transactions of comparable businesses. In evaluating the estimates derived by the market based approach, management assesses the relevance and reliability of the multiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including recent operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and other market data. The Company also estimates fair value utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis (i.e., an income approach) in order to validate the results of the market approach in certain circumstances. Once completed, the results of the income and market approaches are reconciled and compared. The discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumptions about projected revenue growth,  

56  

Table of Contents 

 future operating margins, discount rates and terminal values. There are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and managements judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. While the Company believes it has made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of its reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If actual results are not consistent with managements estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings.  

As of December 31, 2009, the Company had 27 reporting units for goodwill impairment testing. The carrying value of the goodwill included in the Companys individual reporting units ranges from approximately $5 million to approximately $2 billion. The Companys annual goodwill impairment analysis in 2009 indicated that in all instances, the fair value of the Companys reporting units exceeded their carrying values and consequently did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Companys reporting units as of the first day of the Companys fiscal fourth quarter, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately 3% to approximately 529%.  

In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations used in the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit and compared those values to the reporting unit carrying values. Based on this sensitivity analysis, the Company identified three reporting units, with an aggregate $2.6 billion carrying value of goodwill, that have a reporting unit carrying value that would exceed fair value if the fair value of those reporting units decreased 10%. On an aggregate basis, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for these three reporting units is 6.5%. The application of the hypothetical 10% decrease in fair value for these three reporting units would result in an aggregate shortfall in fair value of 3.8% as compared to the aggregate carrying value of these three reporting units.  

Long-lived assets. The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the future net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. If such assets were impaired, the Company would be required to recognize a charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value. In determining the fair value of long-lived assets, the Company makes judgments relating to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and its ability to realize any undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets. Factors that impact these judgments include the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in the expected use of the assets, changes in economic conditions, changes in operating performance and anticipated future cash flows. If actual fair value is less than the Companys estimates, long-lived assets may be overstated on the balance sheet and the Company would need to take a charge against net earnings.  

Contingent Liabilities. As discussed above under Legal Proceedings, the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business. The Company recognizes a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liability estimates may change in the future due to new developments or changes in the Companys settlement strategy. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Companys net earnings.  

Revenue Recognition: The Company derives revenues primarily from the sale of products and services. For revenue related to a product or service to qualify for recognition, there must be persuasive evidence of a sale, delivery must have occurred or the services must have been rendered, the price to the customer must be fixed and determinable and collectibility of the balance must be reasonably assured. The Companys standard terms of sale are FOB Shipping Point and, as such, the Company principally records revenue for product sales upon shipment. If any significant obligations to the customer with respect to such sale remain to be fulfilled following shipment, typically involving obligations relating to installation and acceptance by the buyer, revenue recognition is deferred until such obligations have been fulfilled. Product returns consist of estimated returns for products sold and are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale. Customer allowances and rebates, consisting primarily of volume discounts and

 other short-term incentive programs, are recorded as a reduction in reported revenues at the time of sale because these allowances reflect a reduction in the purchase price. Product returns, customer allowances and rebates are estimated based on historical experience and known trends. Revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements is recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement.  

Revenues for contractual arrangements consisting of multiple elements (i.e., deliverables) are recognized for the separate elements when the product or services have value on a stand-alone basis, fair value of the separate elements exists (or in the case of software related products, vendor specific objective evidence of fair value) and, in arrangements that include a general right of refund relative to the delivered element, performance of the undelivered element is considered probable and substantially in the Companys control. While determining fair value and identifying separate elements requires judgment, generally fair value and the separate elements are identifiable as those elements are also sold unaccompanied by other elements.  

Share-Based Compensation: The Company accounts for share-based compensation by measuring the cost of employee services received in exchange for all equity awards granted, including stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and restricted shares, based on the fair value of the award as of the grant date. Equity-based compensation expense is recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. In the case of performance based share-based awards, compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated attribution method.  

Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the awards and stock price volatility. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent managements best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our equity-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the equity-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period.  

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits: Certain of the Companys employees and retired employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans (pension plans) and certain eligible retirees are entitled to health care and life insurance benefits under postretirement benefit plans (postretirement plans). The Company measures its pension and post retirement plans assets and obligations as of the end of each year to determine the funded status of each plan. The Company recognizes an asset for a plans overfunded status or a liability for a plans underfunded status in its statement of financial position. Changes in the funded status of the plans are recognized in the year in which the changes occur and are reported in comprehensive income. Accounting standards require that the amounts the Company records, including the expense or income, associated with the pension and postretirement plans be computed using actuarial valuations.  

Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations including assumptions relating to financial market and other economic conditions. The assumptions used in the actuarial valuation include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates, and other factors. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in the assumptions used by the Company. While the Company believes that the assumptions used in calculating its pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may affect the Companys financial position or results of operations. For the U.S. plan, the Company used a 5.75% discount rate in computing the amount of the minimum pension liability to be recorded at December 31, 2009, which represents a decrease of 50 basis points in the discount rate from December 31, 2008. For non-U.S. plans, rates appropriate for each plan are determined based on investment grade instruments with maturities approximately equal to the average expected benefit payout under the plan. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plans would have increased the U.S. and non-U.S. net obligation by $54 million ($37 million on an after tax basis) from the amount recorded in the financial statements at December 31, 2009.  

For 2009, the expected long-term rate of return assumption applicable to assets held in the United States plan was estimated at 8% which is the same as the rate used in 2008. This expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation

 of the plan and the expected long-term returns on equity and debt investments included in plan assets. The U.S. plan targets to invest between 60% and 70% of its assets in equity portfolios which are invested in funds that are expected to mirror broad market returns for equity securities or in assets with characteristics similar to equity investments. The balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in corporate bonds and bond index funds. Pension expense for the U.S. plan for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $3 million (or $2 million on an after-tax basis), compared with pension benefit of $5 million (or $3 million on an after-tax basis) for this plan in 2008. If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by 0.5%, pension expense for 2009 would have increased $5 million (or $3 million on an after-tax basis). The Company made a voluntary contribution of $60 million to the U.S. plan in 2009. The Companys non-U.S. plan assets are comprised of various insurance contracts, equity and debt securities as determined by the administrator of each plan. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from 0.75% to 8.0% for 2009 and ranged from 1.5% to 8.25% for 2008.

New Accounting Standards  

In December 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2010-02, Accounting and Reporting for Decreases in Ownership of a Subsidiary  a Scope Clarification. The update revises the accounting requirements for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary that were originally contained in FASB Statement No. 160 on non-controlling interests (currently codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation). The revised decrease in ownership provisions require an entity that ceases to have a controlling interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business to recognize a gain or loss on the transaction and include an amount for the remeasurement of any retained investment to fair value. A decrease in ownership that does not result in a loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction with no gain or loss recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the portion of the subsidiary or group of assets that is sold and consideration received from the buyer. The update is effective from the effective date of FASB Statement No. 160, which was January 1, 2009 for the Company. The adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact to the Company, however, the requirements of this update will be required to be applied to any future transactions that results in a decreases in ownership of businesses owned by the Company.  

In October 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-13, Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. This ASU establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements including multiple revenue-generating activities and provides amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting. The amendments also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. Significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendors multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements, including information about the nature and terms, significant deliverables, and its performance within arrangements. The amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling-price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition. The new ASU requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2010, which is the Companys 2011 fiscal year. Early adoption of the standard is permitted and various options for prospective or retroactive adoption are available. The Company is currently in the process of reviewing and evaluating the impact of these new requirements.  

Concurrent with the issuance of ASU No. 2009-13, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-14, Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements. This ASU changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements that are essential to the functionality, and scopes these products out of current software revenue guidance. The new guidance includes factors to help companies determine what software elements are considered essential to the functionality. The amendments will now subject software-enabled products to other revenue guidance and disclosure requirements, such as guidance surrounding revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The amendments in this ASU are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in the fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, which is the Companys 2011 fiscal year. Early adoption of the standard is permitted and various options for prospective or retroactive adoption are available. The Company is in the process of reviewing and evaluating the impact of these new requirements.
