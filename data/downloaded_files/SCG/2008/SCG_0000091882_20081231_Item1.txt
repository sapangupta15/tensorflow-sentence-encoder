table of contents  

Nonregulated Businesses 

SEMI markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy-related risk management services. SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI, markets natural gas to approximately 460,000 customers (as of December 31, 2008) in Georgia's natural gas market. The GPSC has selected SCANA Energy to serve as the state’s regulated provider until August 31, 2009. Two marketers, including SCANA Energy, have made a bid with the GPSC to be the regulated service provider after SCANA Energy’s current contract expires. SCANA Energy expects a decision in March 2009. Included in the above customer count, SCANA Energy serves over 90,000 customers (as of December 31, 2008) under this regulated provider contract, which includes low-income and high credit risk customers. SCANA Energy's total customer base represents approximately a 30% share of the approximately 1.5 million customers in Georgia's deregulated natural gas market. SCANA Energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state. 

SCI owns and operates a 500-mile fiber optic telecommunications network and ethernet network and data center facilities in South Carolina.

SCI also provides tower site construction, management and rental services in South Carolina and North Carolina. 

The preceding Corporate Structure section describes other businesses owned by SCANA. 

COMPETITION 

For a discussion of the impact of competition, see the Overview section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G. 

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 

SCANA’s regulated subsidiaries, including SCE&G, require cash to fund operations, construction programs and dividend payments to SCANA. SCANA’s nonregulated subsidiaries require cash to fund operations and dividend payments to SCANA. To replace existing plant investment and to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas, SCANA’s regulated subsidiaries must attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their construction programs, rate increases will be sought. The future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief, when requested. 

For a discussion of various rate matters and their impact on capital requirements, see the Regulatory Matters section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G. 

During the period 2009-2011, SCANA and SCE&G expect to meet capital requirements through internally generated funds, issuance of equity and short-term and long-term borrowings. SCANA and SCE&G expect that they have or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet their projected cash requirements for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 

For a discussion of cash requirements for construction and nuclear fuel expenditures, contractual cash obligations, financing limits, financing transactions and other related information, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G. 

SCANA's ratios of earnings to fixed charges were 3.04, 3.03, 2.94, 2.19 and 2.65 for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. SCE&G’s ratios of earnings to fixed charges were 3.51, 3.40, 3.32, 2.26 and 3.40 for the same periods. SCE&G’s ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges and preference dividends were 3.29, 3.17, 3.08, 2.10 and 3.15 for the same periods. SCANA’s and SCE&G’s ratios for 2005 were negatively impacted by large amounts of accelerated depreciation that were recorded under an accounting methodology approved by the SCPSC, and because the calculation necessarily excludes the related and fully offsetting synthetic fuel tax benefits recorded in that year.

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS 

Electric Sales 

SCE&G's sales of electricity by customer classification as a percent of electric revenues for 2007 and 2008 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

SCE&G’s margins earned from the sale of electricity by customer classification as a percent of electric margin for 2007 and 2008 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

Sales for resale include sales to seven municipalities. Sales under NMST during 2008 include sales to 13 investor-owned utilities or registered marketers, four electric cooperatives and four federal/state electric agencies. During 2007 sales under the NMST included sales to 20 investor-owned utilities or registered marketers, four electric cooperatives, and four federal/state electric agencies. 

During 2008 SCE&G recorded a net increase of 10,300 electric customers (growth rate of 1.6%), increasing its total electric customers to 649,600 at year end. 

For the period 2009-2011, SCE&G projects total territorial KWh sales of electricity to increase 2.3% annually (assuming normal weather), total electric customer base to increase 2.4% annually and territorial peak load (summer, in MW) to increase 2.2% annually. While SCE&G's goal is to maintain a reserve margin of between 12% and 18%, weather and other factors affect territorial peak load and can cause actual generating capacity on any given day to fall below the reserve margin goal. 

Electric Interconnections 

SCE&G purchases all of the electric generation of GENCO's Williams Station under a Unit Power Sales Agreement which has been approved by FERC. Williams Station has a net generating capacity (summer rating) of 615 MW. 

SCE&G's transmission system is part of an interconnected grid extending over a large part of the southern and eastern portions of the nation. SCE&G interconnects with Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy Carolinas, and Santee Cooper, and these entities, together with Dominion Virginia Power and APGI (Yadkin Division), are members of the Virginia-Carolinas Reliability Group, one of several geographic divisions within the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC). SERC is a regional entity of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) responsible for promoting, coordinating and ensuring the reliability and adequacy of the bulk power supply systems in the geographic area served by the member systems. SCE&G also interconnects with Georgia Power Company, Oglethorpe Power Corporation and the Southeastern Power Administration's Clarks Hill Project. For a discussion of the impact certain legislative and regulatory initiatives may have on SCE&G's transmission system, see Electric Operations within the Overview section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

Fuel Costs and Fuel Supply 

The average cost of various fuels and the weighted average cost of all fuels (including oil) for the years 2006-2008 follow: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

The sources and percentages of total MWh generation by each category of fuel for the years 2006-2008 and the estimates for the years 2009-2011 follow: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

Six of the seven fossil fuel-fired plants use coal. Unit trains and in some cases trucks and barges deliver coal to these plants.  

Coal is obtained through long-term supply contracts and spot market purchases. Long-term contracts exist with eleven suppliers located in eastern Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia. These contracts provide for approximately 5.6 million tons annually, which is 79% of total expected coal purchases for 2009. Sulfur restrictions on the contract coal range from 1.0% to 2.0%. These contracts expire at various times through 2011. Spot market purchases are expected to continue when needed or when prices are believed to be favorable. 

SCANA and SCE&G believe that SCE&G's operations comply with all existing regulations relating to the discharge of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. See additional discussion at Environmental Matters in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G. 

SCE&G has adequate supplies of uranium or enriched uranium product under contract to manufacture nuclear fuel for Summer Station through 2016. The following table summarizes contract commitments for the stages of nuclear fuel assemblies: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a) A region represents approximately one-third to one-half of the nuclear core in the reactor at any one time. Region 20 was loaded in 2008. 

SCE&G can store spent nuclear fuel on-site until at least 2018 and expects to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent fuel output for the life of Summer Station through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. In addition, Summer Station has sufficient on-site storage capacity to permit storage of the entire reactor core in the event that complete unloading should become desirable or necessary. For information about the contract with the DOE regarding disposal of spent fuel, see Hazardous and Solid Wastes within the Environmental Matters section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G.

GAS OPERATIONS 

Gas Sales-Regulated 

Sales of natural gas by customer classification as a percent of total regulated gas revenues sold or transported for 2007 and 2008 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

For the three-year period 2009-2011, SCANA projects total consolidated sales of regulated natural gas in DTs to increase 1.3% annually (assuming normal weather). Annual projected increases over such period in DT sales include residential of 2.1%, commercial of 1.1% and industrial of 0.9%. 

For the three-year period 2009-2011, SCE&G projects total consolidated sales of regulated natural gas in DTs to increase 0.6% annually (assuming normal weather). Annual projected increases (decreases) over such period in DT sales include residential of (0.4)%, commercial of 0.1% and industrial of 1.7%. 

For the three-year period 2009-2011, SCANA's and SCE&G’s total consolidated regulated natural gas customer base is projected to increase annually 2.5% and 1.0%, respectively. During 2008 SCANA recorded a net increase of 15,000 regulated gas customers (growth rate of 2.0%), increasing its regulated gas customers to 774,000. Of this increase, SCE&G recorded a net increase of 4,600 gas customers (growth rate of 1.5%), increasing its total gas customers to 307,200 (as of December 31, 2008). 

Demand for gas changes primarily due to the effect of weather and the price relationship between gas and alternate fuels. 

Gas Cost, Supply and Curtailment Plans 

South Carolina 

SCE&G purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers in both the spot and long-term markets. The gas is brought to South Carolina through transportation agreements with Southern Natural (expiring in 2010), Transco (expiring in 2011 and 2017) and CGTC (expiring in 2011 and 2012). The daily volume of gas that SCE&G is entitled to transport under these contracts on a firm basis is 161,143 DT from Southern Natural, 64,652 DT from Transco and 314,529 DT from CGTC. Natural gas volumes may be brought to SCE&G's system as capacity is available for interruptible transportation. In addition, SCE&G, under contract with SEMI, is entitled to receive a daily contract demand of 120,000 DTs for use in either electric generation or for resale to SCE&G’s customers. 

The daily volume of gas that SEMI is entitled to transport under its service agreement with CGTC (expiring in 2023) on a firm basis is 198,083 DT. 

SCE&G purchased natural gas at an average cost of $10.50 per MCF during 2008 and $9.69 per MCF during 2007. 

SCE&G was allocated 5,406 MMCF of natural gas storage capacity on Southern Natural and Transco. Approximately 5,118 MMCF of gas were in storage on December 31, 2008. To meet the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during periods of maximum demand, SCE&G supplements its supplies of natural gas with two LNG liquefaction and storage facilities. The LNG plants are capable of storing the liquefied equivalent of 1,880 MMCF of natural gas. Approximately 1,756 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage at December 31, 2008. 

North Carolina 

PSNC Energy purchases natural gas under contracts with producers and marketers on a short-term basis at current prices and on a long-term basis for reliability assurance at index prices plus a reservation charge. Transco and Dominion deliver the gas to North Carolina through transportation agreements with expiration dates ranging through 2016. On a peak day, PSNC Energy may transport daily volumes of gas under these contracts on a firm basis of 259,894 DT from Transco and 7,331 DT from Dominion. 

PSNC Energy purchased natural gas at an average cost of $10.18 per DT during 2008 compared to $8.55 per DT during 2007. 

To meet the requirements of its high priority natural gas customers during periods of maximum demand, PSNC Energy supplements its supplies of natural gas with underground natural gas storage services and LNG peaking services. Underground natural gas storage service agreements with Dominion, Columbia Gas Transmission, Transco and Spectra Energy provide for storage capacity of approximately 13,000 MMCF. Approximately 10,500 MMCF of gas were in storage under these agreements at December 31, 2008. In addition, PSNC Energy's LNG facility can store the liquefied equivalent of 1,000 MMCF of natural gas with regasification capability of approximately 100 MMCF per day. Approximately 800 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of gas were in storage at December 31, 2008. LNG storage service agreements with Transco, Cove Point LNG and Pine Needle LNG provide for 1,300 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) of storage space. Approximately 1,100 MMCF (liquefied equivalent) were in storage under these agreements at December 31, 2008. 

SCANA and SCE&G believe that supplies under long-term contracts and supplies available for spot market purchase are adequate to meet existing customer demands and to accommodate growth. 

Gas Marketing-Nonregulated 

SEMI markets natural gas and provides energy-related risk management services primarily in the Southeast. In addition, SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI, markets natural gas to approximately 460,000 customers (as of December 31, 2008) in Georgia's natural gas market. SCANA Energy's total customer base represents approximately a 30% share of the approximately 1.5 million customers in Georgia's deregulated natural gas market. SCANA Energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state. 

Risk Management 

SCANA and SCE&G have established policies and procedures and risk limits to control the level of market, credit, liquidity and operational and administrative risks assumed by them. The Board of Directors of each company has delegated to a Risk Management Committee the authority to set risk limits, establish policies and procedures for risk management and measurement, and to oversee and review the risk management process and infrastructure. The Risk Management Committee, which is comprised of certain officers, including a Risk Management Officer and senior officers, apprises the Board of Directors of each company with regard to the management of risk and brings to the Board's attention any areas of concern. Written policies define the physical and financial transactions that are approved, as well as the authorization requirements and limits for transactions. 

REGULATION 

SCANA, together with its subsidiaries, is subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC and FERC as to the issuance of certain securities, acquisitions and other matters. State public service commissions or FERC regulate certain subsidiaries of SCANA as to the following matters. 

SCE&G is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates, service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short-term borrowings) and other matters. SCE&G is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC as to issuance of short-term borrowings and other matters. 

GENCO is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to issuance of securities (other than short-term borrowings) and is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC as to issuance of short-term borrowings, accounting and other matters. 

PSNC Energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the NCUC as to gas rates, service, issuance of securities (other than notes with a maturity of two years or less or renewals of notes with a maturity of six years or less), accounting and other matters. 

CGTC is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC as to transportation rates, service, accounting and other matters. 

SCANA Energy is regulated by the GPSC through its certification as a natural gas marketer in Georgia and specifically is subject to the jurisdiction of the GPSC as to retail prices for customers served under the regulated provider contract. 

SCE&G and GENCO are subject to regulation under the Federal Power Act, administered by FERC and DOE, in the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and in the sale of electric energy at wholesale for resale, as well as with respect to licensed hydroelectric projects and certain other matters, including accounting. See the Regulatory Matters section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G. 

SCE&G and GENCO have obtained FERC authority to issue short-term indebtedness (pursuant to Section 204 of the Federal Power Act). SCE&G may issue up to $700 million of unsecured promissory notes or commercial paper with maturity dates of one year or less, and GENCO may issue up to $100 million of such short-term indebtedness. The authority to make such issuances will expire on February 6, 2010. 

table of contents  

SCE&G holds licenses under the Federal Power Act for each of its hydroelectric projects. The licenses expire as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

SCE&G applied to FERC for relicensing of the Saluda project on August 27, 2008. This application is currently being reviewed by FERC. 

At the termination of a license under the Federal Power Act, FERC may extend or issue a new license to the previous licensee, FERC may issue a license to another applicant or the federal government may take over the related project. If the federal government takes over a project or if FERC issues a license to another applicant, the federal government or the new licensee, as the case may be, must pay the previous licensee an amount equal to its net investment in the project, not to exceed fair value, plus severance damages. 

For a discussion of legislative and regulatory initiatives being implemented that will affect SCE&G's transmission system, see Electric Operations within the Overview section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G. 

SCE&G is subject to regulation by the NRC with respect to the ownership, operation and decommissioning of Summer Station. The NRC's jurisdiction encompasses broad supervisory and regulatory powers over the construction and operation of nuclear reactors, including matters of health and safety, antitrust considerations and environmental impact. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency reviews, in conjunction with the NRC, certain aspects of emergency planning relating to the operation of nuclear plants. 

RATE MATTERS 

For a discussion of the impact of various rate matters, see the Regulatory Matters section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G, and Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G. 

SCE&G's gas rate schedules for its residential, small commercial and small industrial customers include a WNA. SCE&G's WNA was approved by the SCPSC and is in effect for bills rendered during the period November 1 through April 30 of each year. The WNA increases tariff rates if weather is warmer than normal and decreases rates if weather is colder than normal. The WNA does not change the seasonality of gas revenues, but reduces fluctuations in revenues and earnings caused by abnormal weather. 

Prior to November 1, 2008, PSNC Energy had in effect an NCUC-approved WNA for its natural gas rate schedules, with similar, though not identical, provisions to those of SCE&G’s WNA mechanism. Effective November 1, 2008, PSNC Energy was authorized by the NCUC to implement a CUT, a rate decoupling mechanism that breaks the link between revenues and the amount of natural gas sold. The CUT allows PSNC Energy to periodically adjust its base rates for residential and commercial customers based on average per customer consumption whether impacted by weather or other factors.  

On February 11, 2009 the SCPSC approved SCE&G’s combined application pursuant to the Base Load Review Act (the BLRA), seeking a certificate of environmental compatibility and public convenience and necessity and for a base load review order, relating to proposed construction by SCE&G and Santee Cooper to build and operate two new nuclear generating units at Summer Station. Beginning with the initial proceeding, SCE&G will be allowed to file revised rates with the SCPSC each year to incorporate any nuclear construction work in progress incurred. Requested rate adjustments would be based on SCE&G’s updated cost of debt and capital structure and on an allowed return on common equity of 11%. On February 11, 2009 the SCPSC approved the initial rate increase of $7.8 million or 0.4% related to recovery of the cost of capital on project expenditures through June 30, 2008. 

table of contents  

Fuel Cost Recovery Procedures 

The SCPSC’s fuel cost recovery procedure determines the fuel component in SCE&G's retail electric base rates annually based on projected fuel costs for the ensuing 12-month period, adjusted for any overcollection or undercollection from the preceding 12-month period. The statutory definition of fuel costs includes certain variable environmental costs, such as ammonia, lime, limestone and catalysts consumed in reducing or treating emissions. The definition also includes the cost of emission allowances used for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury and particulates. SCE&G may request a formal proceeding at any time should circumstances dictate such a review. On October 30, 2008, the SCPSC approved a settlement agreement between SCE&G and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff (ORS), whereby SCE&G increased the fuel cost portion of its electric rates. SCE&G sought the increase due to significant increases in fuel costs through the first half of 2008. The increase was effective with the first billing cycle of November 2008. 

SCE&G's tariffs include a purchased gas adjustment (PGA) clause that provides for the recovery of actual gas cost incurred, including costs related to hedging natural gas purchasing activities. SCE&G’s rates are calculated using a methodology which adjusts the cost of gas monthly based on a twelve-month rolling average. 

 PSNC Energy is subject to a Rider D rate mechanism which allows it to recover, in any manner authorized by the NCUC, losses on negotiated gas and transportation sales. The Rider D rate mechanism also allows PSNC Energy to recover from customers all prudently incurred gas costs and certain uncollectible expenses related to gas cost. 

PSNC Energy's rates are established using a benchmark cost of gas approved by the NCUC, which may be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the market price of natural gas. PSNC Energy revises its tariffs with the NCUC as necessary to track these changes, and accounts for any over- or under-collections of the delivered cost of gas in its deferred accounts for subsequent rate consideration. The NCUC reviews PSNC Energy's gas purchasing practices annually. 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

Federal and state authorities have imposed environmental regulations and standards relating primarily to air emissions, wastewater discharges and solid, toxic and hazardous waste management. Developments in these areas may require that equipment and facilities be modified, supplemented or replaced. The ultimate effect of these regulations and standards upon existing and proposed operations cannot be predicted. For a more complete discussion of how these regulations and standards impact SCANA and SCE&G, see the Environmental Matters section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for SCANA and SCE&G and Note 10B to the consolidated financial statements for SCANA and SCE&G. 

OTHER MATTERS
