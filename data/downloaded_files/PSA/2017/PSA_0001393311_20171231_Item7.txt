ITEM 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto.  

 Critical Accounting Policies  

 Our MD&A discusses our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), and are affected by our judgments, assumptions and estimates. The notes to our December 31, 2017 financial statements, primarily Note 2, summarize our significant accounting policies.   

 We believe the following are our critical accounting policies, because they have a material impact on the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and they require us to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.  

 Income Tax Expense: We have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that is fully distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules. We believe we have met these REIT requirements for all periods presented herein. Accordingly, we have recorded no federal income tax expense related to our REIT taxable income.   

 Our evaluation that we have met the REIT requirements could be incorrect, because compliance with the tax rules requires factual determinations, and circumstances we have not identified could result in noncompliance with the tax requirements in current or prior years. For any taxable year that we fail to qualify as a REIT and for which applicable statutory relief provisions did not apply, we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income for at least that year and the ensuing four years, we could be subject to penalties and interest, and our net income would be materially different from the amounts estimated in our financial statements.   

 In addition, certain of our consolidated corporate subsidiaries have elected to be treated as “taxable REIT subsidiaries” for federal income tax purposes, which are taxable as regular corporations and subject to certain limitations on intercompany transactions. If tax authorities determine that amounts paid by our taxable REIT subsidiaries to us are not reasonable compared to similar arrangements among unrelated parties, we could be subject to a 100% penalty tax on the excess payments. Such a penalty tax could have a material adverse impact on our net income.  

 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets: The analysis of impairment of our long-lived assets involves identification of indicators of impairment, projections of future operating cash flows, and estimates of fair values, all of which require significant judgment and subjectivity. Others could come to materially different conclusions. In addition, we may not have identified all current facts and circumstances that may affect impairment. Any unidentified impairment loss, or change in conclusions, could have a material adverse impact on our net income.  

 Accrual for Uncertain and Contingent Liabilities: We accrue for certain contingent and other liabilities that have significant uncertain elements, such as property taxes, workers compensation claims, tenant reinsurance claims, as well as other legal claims and disputes involving customers, employees, governmental agencies and other third parties. We estimate such liabilities based upon many factors such as assumptions of past and future trends and our evaluation of likely outcomes. However, the estimates of known liabilities could be incorrect or we may not be aware of all such liabilities, in which case our accrued liabilities and net income could be misstated.   

 Accounting for Acquired Real Estate Facilities: We estimate the fair values of the land, buildings and intangible assets acquired for purposes of allocating the purchase price. Such estimates are based upon many assumptions and judgments, including (i) market rates of return and capitalization rates on real estate and intangible assets, (ii) building and material cost levels, (iii) comparisons of the acquired underlying land parcels to recent land transactions, and (iv) future cash flows from the real estate and the existing tenant base. Others could come to   

 24  

materially different conclusions as to the estimated fair values, which would result in different depreciation and amortization expense, gains and losses on sale of real estate assets, and real estate and intangible assets.  

 Overview  

 Our self-storage operations generate most of our net income, and we believe that our earnings growth is most impacted by the level of organic growth in our existing self-storage portfolio. Accordingly, a significant portion of management’s time is devoted to maximizing cash flows from our existing self-storage facilities.   

 Most of our facilities compete with other well-managed and well-located competitors and we are subject to general economic conditions, particularly those that affect the spending habits of consumers and moving trends. We believe that our centralized information networks, national telephone and online reservation system, the brand name “Public Storage,” and our economies of scale enable us to meet such challenges effectively.  

 We plan on growing organically as well as  through the acquisition and development of additional facilities. Since the beginning of 2013 through December 31, 2017, we acquired a total of 271 facilities with 19.0 million net rentable square feet from third parties for approximately $2.5 billion, and we opened newly developed and redeveloped self-storage space for a total cost of $887.4 million, adding approximately 8.1 million net rentable square feet.   

 Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we acquired or were under contract to acquire (subject to customary closing conditions) two self-storage facilities for $18.3 million. We will continue to seek to acquire properties; however, there is significant competition to acquire existing facilities and there can be no assurance as to the level of facilities we may acquire.   

 As of December 31, 2017, we had additional development and redevelopment projects in process which will add approximately 4.6 million net rentable square feet at a total cost of approximately $613.8 million. We expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of such activity may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding available sites that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations, as well as challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.   

 We believe that our development and redevelopment activities are beneficial to our business over the long run. However, in the short run, such activities dilute our earnings due to the three to four year period that it takes to fill up newly developed and redeveloped storage facilities and reach a stabilized level of cash flows offset by the cost of capital to fund the cost, combined with related overhead expenses flowing through general and administrative expense. We believe this dilution will increase in 2018 and beyond, because of an increased level of net rentable square feet being added to our portfolio due to continued development and redevelopment efforts.   

 On September 18, 2017, we completed a public offering of $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes in two equal tranches (collectively, the “U.S. Dollar Notes”), one maturing in September 2022 bearing interest at 2.370%, and another maturing in September 2027 bearing interest at 3.094%. This was our first public offering of debt, which should also serve to facilitate future offerings.    

 As of December 31, 2017, our capital resources over the next year are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion which exceeds our current planned capital needs over the next year of approximately $378.9 million. Our capital resources include: (i) $433.4 million of cash as of December 31, 2017, (ii) $483.9 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit, and (iii) approximately $200 million to $300 million of expected retained operating cash flow for the next twelve months. Retained operating cash flow represents our expected cash flow provided by operating activities, less shareholder distributions and capital expenditures to maintain our real estate facilities.   

 Our planned capital needs over the next year consist of (i) $349.4 million of remaining spend on our current development pipeline, (ii) $18.3 million in property acquisitions currently under contract, and (iii) $11.2 million in principal repayments on existing debt. Our capital needs may increase significantly over the next year as we expect   

 25  

to increase our development pipeline and acquire additional properties. In addition to other investment activities, we may also redeem outstanding preferred securities or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future.   

 In August and September of 2017, due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, we recorded a $7.8 million casualty loss due to damaged buildings and associated expenses, as well as $5.2 million in incremental ancillary cost of operations representing claims costs resulting from the hurricanes with respect to tenants covered under our tenant reinsurance program. Current loss estimates (including business interruption) are less than our insurance deductibles, as a result, we do not expect to receive any insurance proceeds.  

 See Liquidity and Capital Resources for further information regarding our capital requirements and anticipated sources of capital to fund such requirements.   

 Results of Operations   

 Operating results for 2017 and 2016  

 In 2017, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1,171.6 million or $6.73 per diluted common share, compared to $1,183.9 million or $6.81 per share in 2016 representing a decrease of $12.3 million or $0.08. The decrease primarily reflects (i) a $67.6 million reduction due to the impact of foreign exchange translation gains and losses associated with our euro denominated debt, (ii) an $8.5 million increase in interest expense associated with higher outstanding debt balances and (iii) a $7.8 million casualty loss and $5.2 million in incremental tenant reinsurance losses related to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma offset partially by (iv) a $66.9 million increase in self-storage net operating income (described below) and (v) an $18.9 million increase in our equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities.  

 The $66.9 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $44.6 million increase in our Same Store Facilities (as defined below) and a $22.3 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 3.0% or $63.0 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 3.4% or $18.4 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased property taxes, advertising and selling expense and repairs and maintenance costs, offset partially by lower snow removal costs. The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of 345 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded since January 2015.  

 Operating results for 2016 and 2015  

 In 2016, net income allocable to our common shareholders was $1,183.9 million or $6.81 per diluted common share, compared to $1,053.1 million or $6.07 per share in 2015 representing an increase of $130.8 million or $0.74 per share. The increase is primarily due to (i) a $139.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (ii) a $17.3 million increase in foreign exchange translation gains associated with our euro denominated debt offset partially by (iii) a $29.0 million reduction in gains on sales of real estate investments, including our equity share and (iv) a $20.0 million increase in EITF D-42 charges, including our equity share, as a result of preferred redemption activities.  

 The $139.1 million increase in self-storage net operating income is a result of a $104.6 million increase in our Same Store Facilities and a $34.5 million increase in our Non Same Store Facilities. Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 5.8% or $117.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 2.5% or $13.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to increased property taxes, on-site property manager payroll and repairs and maintenance, offset partially by lower snow removal costs. The increase in net operating income for the Non Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of 295 self-storage facilities acquired, developed or expanded in 2015 and 2016.

 Funds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations  

 Funds from Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. FFO represents net income before real estate depreciation, which is excluded because it is based upon historical real estate costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges, which are also based upon historical real estate costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.  

 For each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, FFO was $9.70 per diluted common share, as compared to $8.79 for the same period in 2015, representing an increase in 2016 of 10.4%, or $0.91 per diluted common share.  

 The following tables reconcile diluted earnings per share to FFO per share and set forth the computation of FFO per share:  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 We also present “Core FFO per share,” a non-GAAP measure that represents FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (ii) EITF D-42 charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, (iii) reversals of accruals with respect to share based awards forfeited by executive officers and (iv) certain   

 27  

other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items. We review Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance, and we believe it is used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However, Core FFO per share is not a substitute for net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure, Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.  

 The following table reconciles FFO per share to Core FFO per share:

 Analysis of Net Income by Reportable Segment  

 The following discussion and analysis is presented and organized in accordance with Note 11 to our December 31, 2017 financial statements, “Segment Information.” Accordingly, refer to the tables presented in Note 11 in order to reconcile such amounts to our total net income and for further information on our reportable segments.  

 Self-Storage Operations  

 Our self-storage operations are analyzed in two groups: (i) the 2,042 facilities that we have owned and operated on a stabilized basis since January 1, 2015 (the “Same Store Facilities”), and (ii) all other facilities, which are newly acquired, newly developed, or recently redeveloped (the “Non Same Store Facilities”). See Note 11 to our December 31, 2017 financial statements “Segment Information,” for a reconciliation of the amounts in the tables below to our total net income.  

 28  

 ﻿  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (a)    Net operating income or “NOI” is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of depreciation and amortization expense, which is based upon historical real estate costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. We utilize NOI in determining current property values, evaluating property performance, and in evaluating property operating trends. We believe that investors and analysts utilize NOI in a similar manner. NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results. See Note 11 to our December 31, 2017 financial statements for a reconciliation of NOI to our total net income for all periods presented. 

 Net operating income from our self-storage operations has increased 3.7% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and 8.4% in 2016 as compared to 2015. These increases are due to higher revenues in our Same Store Facilities, as well as the acquisition and development of new facilities and the fill-up of unstabilized facilities.   

 29  

 Same Store Facilities  

 The Same Store Facilities represent those facilities that have been owned and operated at a stabilized level of occupancy, revenues and cost of operations since January 1, 2015. We review the operations of our Same Store Facilities, which excludes facilities whose operating trends are significantly affected by factors such as casualty events, as well as recently developed or acquired facilities, to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2015, 2016, and 2017. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2,042 facilities (130.3 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 82% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at December 31, 2017.  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 30  

   (a)    Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sale revenues and expenses generated at the facilities. 

   (b)    Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing rental income, before late charges and administrative fees, by the total available net rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency, and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition, the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts, which reduce rental income.  

   (c)    Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in, and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis, such as late charges and administrative fees, does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts, and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible.  

 Analysis of Same Store Revenue  

 Revenues generated by our Same Store Facilities increased by 3.0% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and by 5.8% in 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to increases of 3.9% and 5.8% in 2017 and 2016, respectively, as compared to the year prior for the respective periods in realized annual rental income per occupied square foot.   

 Year-over-year growth in our Same Store revenues has declined from 5.8% in 2016 as compared to 2015, to 3.0% in 2017 as compared to 2016. Growth trends were decelerating throughout 2017, with year over year revenue growth at 4.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, 3.4% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, 2.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2017, and 2.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2017. We are experiencing softness in demand in substantially all of our major markets, which has led to lower move-in volumes combined with a lack of pricing power with respect to new tenants. We attribute some of this softness to local economic conditions and, in some markets most notably Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, and New York, increased supply of newly constructed self-storage facilities.  

 Same Store weighted average square foot occupancy remained strong at 93.8%, 94.5% and 94.4% during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as move-out volumes declined in 2017, partially offsetting lower move-in volume.   

 We believe that high occupancies help maximize our rental income. We seek to maintain a weighted average square foot occupancy level of at least 90%, by regularly adjusting the rental rates and promotions offered to attract new tenants as well as adjusting our marketing efforts on both television and the Internet in order to generate sufficient move-in volume to replace tenants that vacate.  

 Increasing rental rates to existing tenants, generally on an annual basis, is a key component of our revenue growth. We determine the level of rental increases based upon our expectations regarding the impact of existing tenant rate increases on incremental move-outs. Rental rate increases to existing tenants in 2017 have been similar to 2016, and we expect rate increases to existing tenants in 2018 to be similar to 2017.   

 Annual contract rent per occupied foot increased 3.0% from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, as compared to a 4.9% increase from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. These year-over-year increases were primarily driven by annual rate increases given to existing tenants, partially offset by the net impact of replacing vacating tenants with new tenants with lower contract rates, or “rent roll down.” The reduction in the year over year growth in average contract rent per occupied foot to 3.0% from 4.9% is due primarily to a greater degree of rent roll down.   

 During 2017 and 2016, the annual contract rent for tenants who moved in was flat at $14.67 per foot, and the annual contract rent for tenants who moved out increased 2.8% to $16.10 per foot as compared to $15.66 per foot for 2016. During 2016, the annual contract rent for tenants who moved in increased 1.4% to $14.67 per foot as compared to $14.47 in 2015, and the annual contract rent for tenants who moved out increased 4.1% to $15.66 per foot as compared to $15.05 per foot for 2015.   

 31  

In order to stimulate move-in volume, we often give promotional discounts, generally in the form of a “$1.00 rent for the first month” offer. Promotional discounts, based upon the move-in contractual rates for the related promotional period, totaled $83.6 million, $87.1 million and $86.6 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are recorded as a reduction to revenue.    

 Demand is higher in the summer months than in the winter months and, as a result, rental rates charged to new tenants are typically higher in the summer months than in the winter months. Demand fluctuates due to various local and regional factors, including the overall economy. Demand into our system is also impacted by new supply of self-storage space as well as alternatives to self-storage.   

 We believe rental growth in 2018 will come primarily from continued annual rent increases to existing tenants. Our future rental growth will also be dependent upon many factors for each market that we operate in, including demand for self-storage space, the level of new supply of self-storage space and the average length of stay of our tenants.   

 We believe that the current trends in move-in, move-out, in place contractual rents and occupancy levels are consistent with continued moderate revenue growth in 2018. However, there can be no assurance of continued revenue growth, because current trends, when viewed in the short-run, are volatile and not necessarily predictive of our revenues going forward because they are subject to many short-term factors. Such factors include initial move-in rates, seasonal factors, the unit size and geographical mix of the specific tenants moving in or moving out, the length of stay of the tenants moving in or moving out, changes in our pricing strategies, the level of consumer demand, competition from newly developed facilities, and the degree and timing of rate increases previously passed to existing tenants.  

 We are taking a number of actions to improve demand into our system, including (i) increasing marketing spend on the Internet, and (ii) reducing rental rates and continuing to offer promotional discounts to new tenants. Even if these actions are successful in improving demand into our system, in at least the near term, we believe these actions may have a negative impact on our revenue trends due to less growth in initial rental rates and increased promotional discounts.  

 Analysis of Same Store Cost of Operations   

 Cost of operations (excluding depreciation and amortization) increased 3.4% in 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to increased property tax expense, advertising and selling expense, and repairs and maintenance expense (excluding snow removal cost), partially offset by reduced snow removal cost. Cost of operations increased by 2.5% in 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to increased property tax expense, on-site property manager payroll, and repairs and maintenance expense (excluding snow removal cost), partially offset by reduced snow removal cost.   

 Property tax expense increased 4.0% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and by 4.8% in 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher assessed values. We expect property tax expense growth of approximately 4.5% in 2018 due primarily to higher assessed values and changes in tax rates.  

 On-site property manager payroll expense increased 1.0% in 2017 as compared to 2016 due primarily to higher wage rates and by 3.4% in 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to reductions in prior estimates of workers compensation costs recorded in 2015, higher employee health care expenses experienced in 2016 and higher wage rates. We expect on-site property manager payroll expense to increase on an inflationary basis in 2018.  

 Supervisory payroll expense, which represents compensation paid to the management personnel who directly and indirectly supervise the on-site property managers, increased 2.9% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and in 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to higher wage rates and increased headcount. We expect inflationary increases in wage rates and stable headcount in 2018.   

 32  

Repairs and maintenance expense increased 4.8% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and decreased 5.5% in 2016 as compared to 2015. Repair and maintenance costs include snow removal expense totaling $3.1 million, $4.2 million and $9.8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding snow removal costs, repairs and maintenance increased 8.2% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and 8.0% in 2016 as compared to 2015.  

 Repairs and maintenance expense levels are dependent upon many factors such as weather conditions, which can impact repair and maintenance needs including snow removal, inflation in material and labor costs, and random events. We expect inflationary increases in repairs and maintenance expense in 2018, excluding snow removal expense, which is primarily weather dependent and not predictable.   

 Our utility expenses are comprised primarily of electricity costs, which are dependent upon energy prices and usage levels. Changes in usage levels are driven primarily by weather and temperature. Utility expense decreased 0.7% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and 3.5% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The decrease in 2016 over 2015 is due primarily to lower usage as a result of milder weather. It is difficult to estimate future utility costs, because weather, temperature, and energy prices are volatile and not predictable.   

 Advertising and selling expense is comprised principally of Internet advertising, television advertising and the operating costs of our telephone reservation center. Advertising and selling expense varies based upon demand, occupancy levels, and other factors. Television and Internet advertising, in particular, can increase or decrease significantly in the short term. Advertising and selling expenses increased 10.1% in 2017 as compared to 2016 due primarily to increased Internet marketing expenditures. Advertising and selling expenses increased 0.4% in 2016 as compared to 2015. We expect moderate increases in advertising and selling expense in 2018.   

 Other direct property costs include administrative expenses incurred at the self-storage facilities, such as property insurance, business license costs, bank charges related to processing the facilities’ cash receipts, credit card fees, and the cost of operating each property’s rental office. These costs increased 3.7% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and 3.6% in 2016 as compared to 2015. The increases were due primarily to higher credit card fees, due to a higher proportion of collections being received from credit cards and higher revenues. We expect inflationary increases in other direct property costs in 2018.   

 Allocated overhead represents administrative expenses for shared general corporate functions, which are allocated to self-storage property operations to the extent their efforts are devoted to self-storage operations. Such functions include information technology, human resources, operational accounting and finance, marketing, and costs of senior executives (other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, which are included in general and administrative expense). Allocated overhead increased 5.1% in 2017 as compared to 2016, due to increased headcount and information technology expenses, offset partially by the timing of our annual sales conference. Allocated overhead increased 4.5% in 2016 as compared to 2015 due primarily to additional costs of our annual field staff sales meetings and increased compensation costs. We expect greater than inflationary increases in allocated overhead in 2018 due primarily to increased information technology expenses.   

 Analysis of Same Store Depreciation and Amortization  

 Depreciation and amortization for Same Store Facilities decreased 1.5% in 2017 as compared to 2016 and 4.8% in 2016 as compared to 2015. We expect depreciation to be flat in 2018 as compared to 2017.

 We believe that our geographic diversification and scale provide some insulation from localized economic effects and add to the stability of our cash flows. It is difficult to predict localized trends in short-term self-storage demand and operating results. Over the long run, we believe that markets that experience population growth, high employment, and otherwise exhibit economic strength and consistency will outperform markets that do not exhibit these characteristics.   

 Non Same Store Facilities  

 The Non Same Store Facilities at December 31, 2017 represent 345 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies or rental rates since January 1, 2015, or that we did not own as of January 1, 2015. As a result of the stabilization process and timing of when facilities were newly acquired or development activities were completed, year-over-year changes can be significant.

 The facilities included above under “2017 acquisitions” include 22 facilities acquired from third parties in 2017 at an aggregate cost of $149.8 million, and 12 stabilized facilities previously owned by a legacy institutional partnership. We began consolidating the 12 facilities effective December 31, 2017 when we acquired the remaining 74.25% interest that we did not own in the partnership for $135.5 million. For periods prior to December 31, 2017, our existing 25.75% interest in the partnership was reflected as Equity in Earnings of Real Estate Entities, and fees for managing these properties were included in Interest and Other Income on our income statements.   

 The facilities under “2016 acquisitions” and “2015 acquisitions” were acquired from third parties at a cost of $429.1 million and $168.8 million, respectively.   

 For the year ended December 31, 2017, the weighted average annualized yield on cost, based upon net operating income, for the facilities acquired in each of 2016 and 2015 was 5.3% and 6.9%, respectively. The yields for the facilities acquired in the year ended December 31, 2017 were not meaningful due to our limited ownership period.  

 We believe that our management and operating infrastructure allows us to generate higher net operating income from newly acquired facilities than was achieved by the previous owners. However, it can take 24 or more months for us to fully achieve the higher net operating income, and the ultimate levels of net operating income to be achieved can be affected by changes in general economic conditions. As a result, there can be no assurance that we will achieve our expectations with respect to these newly acquired facilities.   

 Since the beginning of 2013, we have opened newly developed facilities with a total cost of $678.6 million and redeveloped existing facilities, expanding their square footage, for a total cost of $208.8 million. The newly developed facilities are included in “Developed facilities” and the redeveloped facilities are included in “Other facilities” in the table above. We believe that our real estate development activities are beneficial to our business over the long run. However, in the short run, development activities dilute our earnings due to the three to four year period to reach a stabilized level of cash flows and the cost of capital to fund development, combined with general and administrative expenses associated with development. We believe this dilution will increase in 2018 because of an increased level of net rentable square feet being added to our portfolio.  

 We expect the Non Same Store Facilities to continue to provide increased net operating income in 2018 as these facilities approach stabilized occupancy levels and the earnings of the 2017 acquisitions are reflected in our operations for a longer period in 2018 as compared to 2017.   

 39  

We also expect to increase the number and net rentable square feet of Non Same Store Facilities through development of new self-storage facilities, redevelopment of existing facilities and acquisitions of facilities.   

 As of December 31, 2017, we had development and redevelopment projects which will add approximately 4.6 million net rentable square feet of storage space at a total cost of approximately $613.8 million. Some of these projects are subject to significant contingencies such as entitlement approval. We expect to continue to seek additional development projects; however, the level of future development may be limited due to various constraints such as difficulty in finding projects that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.   

 Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we acquired or were under contract to acquire (subject to customary closing conditions) two self-storage facilities for $18.3 million. We will continue to seek to acquire properties; however, there is significant competition to acquire existing facilities and therefore the dollar value of acquisitions is unpredictable.   

 Depreciation and amortization with respect to the Non Same Store Facilities totaled $102.5 million, $76.1 million and $50.6 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts include i) depreciation of the buildings acquired or developed, which is recorded generally on a straight line basis, and ii) amortization of cost allocated to the tenants in place upon acquisition of a facility, which is recorded based upon the benefit of such existing tenants to each period and thus is highest when the facility is first acquired and declines as such tenants vacate. With respect to Non Same Store Facilities owned at December 31, 2017, depreciation of buildings and amortization of tenant intangibles is expected to total $100.8 million and $12.0 million, respectively, in 2018. The level of future depreciation and amortization will also depend upon the level of acquisitions of facilities and the level of newly developed storage space.  

 Ancillary Operations  

 Ancillary revenues and expenses include amounts associated with the reinsurance of policies against losses to goods stored by tenants in our self-storage facilities in the U.S. and the sale of merchandise at our self-storage facilities. The following table sets forth our ancillary operations:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Tenant reinsurance operations: Our tenants have the option of purchasing insurance from a non-affiliated insurance company to cover certain losses to their goods stored at our facilities. A wholly-owned, consolidated subsidiary of Public Storage fully reinsures such policies, and thereby assumes all risk of losses under these policies   

 40  

from the insurance company. The subsidiary receives reinsurance premiums, substantially equal to the premiums collected from our tenants, from the non-affiliated insurance company. Such reinsurance premiums are shown as “Tenant reinsurance premiums” in the above table.   

 The subsidiary pays a fee to Public Storage to assist with the administration of the program and to allow the insurance to be marketed to our tenants. This fee represents a substantial amount of the reinsurance premiums received by our subsidiary. The fee is eliminated in consolidation and is therefore not shown in the above table.   

 Tenant reinsurance revenue increased from $109.8 million in 2015 to $118.9 million in 2016, and to $122.9 million in 2017, due primarily to an increase in our tenant base due to newly acquired and developed facilities and, with respect to the increase from 2015 to 2016, increased average premiums per insured tenant resulting from higher average policy limits.  

 We expect future growth will come primarily from tenants of newly acquired and developed facilities, as well as additional tenants at our existing unstabilized self-storage facilities.   

 Cost of operations primarily includes claims paid that are not covered by our outside third-party insurers, as well as claims adjustment expenses. Claims expenses vary based upon the level of insured tenants, and the level events affecting claims at particular properties (such as burglary) as well as catastrophic weather events affecting multiple properties such as hurricanes and floods. Cost of operations increased from $26.0 million in 2015, to $29.1 million in 2016, and to $30.6 million in 2017. Amounts for 2016 includes flooding in Houston and South Carolina, while claims cost for 2017 includes the impact of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.   

 Merchandise sales: We sell locks, boxes, and packing supplies at our self-storage facilities, and the level of sales of these items is primarily impacted by the level of move-ins and other customer traffic at our self-storage facilities. We do not expect any significant changes in revenues or profitability from our merchandise sales in 2018.  

 Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities  

 At December 31, 2017, we have equity investments in PSB and Shurgard Europe, which we account for on the equity method and record our pro-rata share of the net income of these entities for each period.  The following table, and the discussion below, sets forth the significant components of our equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities:  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

   (a)    This represents our equity earnings in a legacy institutional partnership. On December 31, 2017, we acquired the 74.25% interest that we did not own in this partnership for $135.5 million. As a result, no further equity earnings will be recorded.  

 Investment in PSB: At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had approximately a 42% common equity interest in PS Business Parks, Inc. (“PSB”), comprised of our ownership of 7,158,354 shares of PSB’s common stock and 7,305,355 limited partnership units in an operating partnership controlled by PSB. The limited partnership units are convertible at our option, subject to certain conditions, on a one-for-one basis into PSB common stock.   

 41  

At December 31, 2017, PSB wholly-owned approximately 28 million rentable square feet of commercial space and had an interest in 395 apartments. PSB also manages commercial space that we own pursuant to property management agreements.   

 Equity in earnings from PSB increased $14.8 million in 2017, as compared to 2016, due primarily to improved real estate facility operating results, reduced depreciation expense, a gain on sale of real estate in 2017, and lower interest expense due to the repayment of debt. Equity in earnings from PSB decreased $2.4 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to our $11.3 million equity share of gains on dispositions recorded by PSB in 2015, offset partially by our equity share of improved property operations. See Note 4 to our December 31, 2017 financial statements for selected financial information on PSB, as well as PSB’s filings and selected financial information that can be accessed through the SEC, and on PSB’s website, www.psbusinessparks.com.  

 Investment in Shurgard Europe: We have a 49% equity share in Shurgard Europe’s net income. At December 31, 2017, Shurgard Europe’s operations are comprised of 221 wholly-owned facilities with 12 million net rentable square feet. See Note 4 to our December 31, 2017 financial statements for selected financial data on Shurgard Europe for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. As described in more detail in Note 4, we receive trademark license fees from Shurgard Europe.   

 Our equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe increased $3.6 million in 2017 as compared to 2016, and $8.1 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to improved same-store operating results and increased earnings from newly acquired properties.  

 In 2017, Shurgard Europe opened two newly developed facilities in the United Kingdom with an aggregate total cost of $28.8 million. In 2016, Shurgard Europe opened a newly developed facility in the United Kingdom with a total cost of $12.9 million and in 2015, Shurgard Europe opened three newly developed facilities in the United Kingdom with a total cost of $39.4 million.   

 In June 2015, Shurgard Europe acquired 21 facilities in the Netherlands (0.9 million net rentable square feet), for approximately $146 million (€132 million).   

 In each of July 2014 and June 2015, Shurgard Europe issued €300 million of unsecured senior notes in various tranches due between July 2021 and June 2030, with an average interest rate of approximately 2.9%.  

  Unlike our operations in the U.S., Shurgard Europe operates through taxable corporations in each of the countries in which it does business and incurs tax expense. Our equity share of such income tax expense was approximately $8.6 million, $5.2 million and $5.3 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

 For purposes of recording our equity in earnings from Shurgard Europe, the Euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately 1.198 U.S. Dollars per Euro at December 31, 2017 (1.052 at December 31, 2016), and average exchange rates of 1.129 for 2017, 1.107 for 2016 and 1.110 for 2015.  

 Our future earnings from Shurgard Europe will be affected primarily by the operating results of its existing facilities, the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and currencies in the countries in which Shurgard Europe conducts its business (principally the Euro), the impact of income taxes, and the degree to which Shurgard Europe reinvests the cash it generates from operations into real estate investments or distributes the amounts to its shareholders.

 Analysis of items not allocated to segments  

 General and administrative expense: The following table sets forth our general and administrative expense:   

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 Share-based compensation expense includes the amortization of restricted share units and stock options granted to employees and trustees, as well as related employer taxes. Share-based compensation expense varies based upon the level of grants and their related vesting and amortization periods, forfeitures, as well as the Company’s common share price on the date of grant. Share-based compensation costs in 2017 include a $5.4 million reversal of previously amortized costs, due to the forfeiture of share-based compensation resulting from the retirement of certain senior executives in the quarter ended June 30, 2017.   

 We expect a $23.6 million increase in share-based compensation expense in 2018 with respect to share-based grants to our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") as of December 31, 2017, who are expected to retire at the end of 2018 and then serve as Trustees of the Company for the foreseeable future. While the actual vesting of such share-based compensation will not accelerate, and will continue to vest under the original schedule only if they continue to serve as trustees, GAAP indicates that the respective service periods for their previous grants while CEO and CFO effectively end on the date of their retirement as CEO and CFO. As a result, the remaining unamortized expense on outstanding grants at December 31, 2017 will be recognized through December 31, 2018, increasing 2018 expense $23.6 million above what it would have been without the acceleration of amortization. Any additional grants to our CEO and CFO in 2018 will also be amortized through December 31, 2018 and further increase our share-based compensation expense for 2018. See Note 10 to our December 31, 2017 financial statements for further information on our share-based compensation.   

 Costs of senior executives represent the cash compensation paid to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer.   

 Development and acquisition costs primarily represent internal and external expenses related to our development activities and the acquisition of real estate facilities and varies primarily based upon the level of development activities undertaken. The amounts in the above table are net of $9.4 million, $8.5 million and $8.1 million for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in development costs that were capitalized to newly developed and redeveloped self-storage facilities. Development and acquisition costs are expected to increase modestly in 2018.   

 Tax compliance costs and taxes paid include taxes paid to various state and local authorities, the internal and external costs of filing tax returns, costs associated with complying with federal and state tax laws, and maintaining our compliance with Internal Revenue Service REIT rules. Such costs vary primarily based upon the tax rates of the various states in which we do business.   

 Legal costs include internal personnel as well as fees paid to legal firms and other third parties with respect to general corporate legal matters and risk management, and varies based upon the level of legal activity. The decrease of $11.1 million in 2016 as compared to 2015, is due primarily to legal fees and expenses associated with certain   

 43  

litigated matters in 2015, including $3.5 million accrued in 2015 in connection with the settlement of a legal matter. The future level of legal costs is not determinable.   

 Public company costs represent the incremental costs of operating as a publicly-traded company, such as internal and external investor relations expenses, stock listing and transfer agent fees, board of trustees’ (our “Board”) costs, and costs associated with maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.   

 Other costs represent professional and consulting fees, payroll and overhead that are not directly attributable to our property operations. Such costs vary depending upon the level of corporate activities and initiatives and, as such, are not predictable.  

 Our future general and administrative expenses are difficult to estimate, due to their dependence upon many factors, including those noted above.  

 Interest and other income: Interest and other income is comprised primarily of the net income from our commercial operations and property management operations and to a lesser extent interest earned on cash balances, trademark license fees received from Shurgard Europe, as well as sundry other income items that are received from time to time in varying amounts. Amounts attributable to our commercial operations and property management operations totaled $10.9 million, $10.6 million and $12.0 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We do not expect any significant changes in interest and other income in 2018.   

 Interest expense: For 2017, 2016 and 2015, we incurred $17.1 million, $9.4 million, and $3.3 million, respectively, of interest on our outstanding debt. In determining interest expense, these amounts were offset by capitalized interest of $4.4 million, $5.1 million and $2.7 million during 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, associated with our development activities. On September 18, 2017, we completed a public offering of $1.0 billion notes (the “U.S. Dollar Notes”) bearing an average annual interest rate of 2.732%. At December 31, 2017, we had $1.4 billion of debt outstanding, with an average interest rate of 2.6%. See Note 6 to our December 31, 2017 financial statements for further information on our debt balances. Future interest expense will be dependent upon the level of outstanding debt and the amount of in-process development costs.   

 Foreign Exchange Gain (Loss): For 2017, we recorded a foreign currency translation loss of $50.0 million representing the change in the U.S. Dollar equivalent of our Euro-denominated unsecured notes due to fluctuations in exchange rates (gains of $17.6 million and $306,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively). The Euro was translated at exchange rates of approximately 1.198 U.S. Dollars per Euro at December 31, 2017, 1.052 at December 31, 2016 and 1.091 at December 31, 2015. Future gains and losses on foreign currency translation will be dependent upon changes in the relative value of the Euro to the U.S. Dollar, and the level of Euro-denominated debt outstanding.   

 Casualty Loss: During 2017, we incurred a $7.8 million casualty loss with respect to damage to several of our facilities caused by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.  

 Gain on Real Estate Investment Sales:  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded gains totaling $1.4 million, $689,000 and $18.5 million, respectively, primarily in connection with the partial sale of real estate facilities pursuant to eminent domain proceedings.  

 Net Income Allocable to Preferred Shareholders: Net income allocable to preferred shareholders based upon distributions decreased in 2017 as compared to 2016 and in 2016 as compared to 2015, due primarily to lower average rates offset partially by higher weighted average preferred shares outstanding. We also allocated $29.3 million, $26.9 million and $8.9 million of income from our common shareholders to the holders of our preferred shares in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in connection with the redemption of our preferred shares. Based upon our preferred shares outstanding at December 31, 2017, our quarterly distribution to our preferred shareholders is expected to be approximately $54.1 million.  

 44  

 Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 ﻿  

 Financing Strategy: As a REIT, we generally distribute 100% of our taxable income to our shareholders, which relative to a taxable C corporation, limits the amount of cash flow from operations that we can retain for investments. As a result, in order to grow our asset base, access to capital is important. Historically we have primarily financed our cash investment activities with retained operating cash flow combined with the proceeds from the issuance of preferred securities. Over the past two years, we have diversified our capital sources by issuing medium term debt.   

 Our financial profile is characterized by strong credit metrics, including low leverage relative to our total capitalization and operating cash flows. We are one of the highest rated REITs, as rated by major rating agencies Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. Our unsecured debt has an “A” credit rating by Standard & Poor’s and “A2” by Moody’s. Our credit ratings on each of our series of preferred shares are “A3” by Moody’s and “BBB+” by Standard & Poor’s. Our credit profile and ratings enables us to effectively access both the public and private capital markets to raise capital.  

 We have a $500.0 million revolving line of credit which we occasionally use as temporary “bridge” financing until we are able to raise longer term capital. As of December 31, 2017 and February 28, 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding on the revolving line of credit, however, we do have approximately $16.1 million of outstanding letters of credit which limits our borrowing capacity to $483.9 million.   

 Over the long-term, we expect to fund our capital requirements with retained operating cash flow, the issuance of additional medium or long term debt, and proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred securities. We will select among these sources of capital based upon availability, relative cost, the desire for leverage, refinancing risk, and considering potential constraints caused by certain features of capital sources, such as debt covenants.   

 Liquidity and Capital Resource Analysis: We believe that our net cash provided by our operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our ongoing requirements for principal payments on debt, maintenance capital expenditures, and distributions to our shareholders for the foreseeable future.   

 As of December 31, 2017, our capital resources over the next year are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion which exceeds our current planned capital needs over the next year of approximately $378.9 million. Our capital resources include: (i) $433.4 million of cash as of December 31, 2017, (ii) $483.9 million of available borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit, and (iii) approximately $200 million to $300 million of expected retained operating cash flow for the next twelve months. Retained operating cash flow represents our expected cash flow provided by operating activities, less shareholder distributions and capital expenditures to maintain our real estate facilities.   

 Our planned capital needs over the next year consist of (i) $349.4 million of remaining spend on our current development pipeline, (ii) $18.3 million in property acquisitions currently under contract, and (iii) $11.2 million in principal repayments on existing debt. Our capital needs may increase over the next year as we expect to increase our development pipeline and acquire additional properties. In addition to other investment activities, we may also redeem outstanding preferred securities or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future.   

 To the extent our retained operating cash flow, cash on hand, and line of credit are insufficient to fund our activities, we believe we have a variety of possibilities to raise additional capital including issuing common or preferred securities, issuing debt, or entering into joint venture arrangements to acquire or develop facilities.  

 Required Debt Repayments: As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding debt totaled approximately $1.4 billion, consisting of $29.2 million of secured debt, $409.7 million of Euro-denominated unsecured debt and $1.0 billion of U.S. Dollar denominated unsecured debt. Approximate principal maturities are as follows (amounts in thousands):  

 45  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

 Capital Expenditure Requirements: Capital expenditures include general maintenance, major repairs or replacements to elements of our facilities to keep our facilities in good operating condition and maintain their visual appeal. Capital expenditures do not include costs relating to the development of new facilities or redevelopment of existing facilities to increase their available rentable square footage.   

 Capital expenditures totaled $124.8 million in 2017 and are expected to be approximately $100 million in 2018. However, we are evaluating the potential upgrade of climate control, offices, lighting, and elevator units in certain facilities, which could result in additional capital expenditure amounts in 2018. For the last four years, capital expenditures have ranged between approximately $0.45 and $0.75 per net rentable square foot per year.  

 Requirement to Pay Distributions: For all periods presented herein, we have elected to be treated as a REIT, as defined in the Code. As a REIT, we do not incur federal income tax on our REIT taxable income (generally, net rents and gains from real property, dividends, and interest) that is fully distributed each year (for this purpose, certain distributions paid in a subsequent year may be considered), and if we meet certain organizational and operational rules. We believe we have met these requirements in all periods presented herein, and we expect to continue to elect and qualify as a REIT.   

 Distributions paid during 2017 totaled $1.6 billion, consisting of $236.5 million to preferred shareholders and $1.4 billion to common shareholders and restricted share unitholders. All of these distributions were REIT qualifying distributions.  

 We estimate the annual distribution requirements with respect to our Preferred Shares outstanding at December 31, 2017, to be approximately $216.3 million per year.   

 On February 20, 2018, our Board declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $2.00 per common share. Our consistent, long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Future quarterly distributions with respect to the common shares will continue to be determined based upon our REIT distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders and will be funded with cash provided by operating activities.   

 We estimate we will pay approximately $8.0 million per year in distributions to noncontrolling interests outstanding at December 31, 2017.   

 Real Estate Investment Activities: Subsequent to December 31, 2017, we acquired or were under contract to acquire (subject to customary closing conditions) two self-storage facilities for $18.3 million. We will continue to seek to acquire properties; however, there is significant competition to acquire existing facilities and there can be no assurance as to the level of facilities we may acquire.   

 As of December 31, 2017 we had development and redevelopment projects at a total cost of approximately $613.8 million. A total of $264.4 million of these costs were incurred through December 31, 2017, with the remaining cost to complete of $349.4 million expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 months. Some of these projects are subject to significant contingencies such as entitlement approval. We expect to continue to seek additional projects; however, the level of future development and redevelopment may be limited due to various constraints such   

 46  

as difficulty in finding projects that meet our risk-adjusted yield expectations and challenges in obtaining building permits for self-storage activities in certain municipalities.   

 Redemption of Preferred Securities: Historically, we have taken advantage of refinancing higher coupon preferred securities with lower coupon preferred securities. In the future, we may also elect to finance the redemption of preferred securities with proceeds from the issuance of debt. As of February 28, 2018, we have four series of preferred securities that are eligible for redemption, at our option and with 30 days’ notice; our 5.625% Series U Preferred Shares with $287.5 million outstanding, our 5.375% Series V Preferred Shares with $495.0 million outstanding, our 5.200% Series W Preferred Shares with $500.0 million outstanding and our 5.200% Series X Preferred Shares with $225.0 million outstanding. Redemption of such preferred shares will depend upon many factors. None of our preferred securities are redeemable at the option of the holders.   

 Repurchases of Common Shares: Our Board has authorized management to repurchase up to 35,000,000 of our common shares on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. During 2017, we did not repurchase any of our common shares. From the inception of the repurchase program through February 28, 2018, we have repurchased a total of 23,721,916 common shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $679.1 million. Future levels of common share repurchases will be dependent upon our available capital, investment alternatives and the trading price of our common shares.   

 Contractual Obligations   

 Our significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 and their impact on our cash flows and liquidity are summarized below for the years ending December 31 (amounts in thousands):  

 ﻿  

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 ﻿  

   (1)    Represents contractual principal and interest payments. Amounts with respect to certain Euro-denominated debt are based upon exchange rates at December 31, 2017. See Note 6 to our December 31, 2017 financial statements for further information.  

 (2)Represents future contractual payments on land, equipment and office space under various operating leases.   

 (3)Represents future expected payments for construction under contract at December 31, 2017.  

 We estimate the annual distribution requirements with respect to our Preferred Shares outstanding at December 31, 2017 to be approximately $216.3 million per year. Dividends are paid when and if declared by our Board and accumulate if not paid.   

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: At December 31, 2017, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under Regulation S-K 303(a)(4) and the instructions thereto.
