Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Highlights  

 We continued to experience a difficult economic environment in fiscal 2009. We believe the deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets have adversely impacted consumer disposable income and consumer spending patterns, which in turn is impacting our industry. Our industry has experienced volatile fuel prices and food costs, and our customers have experienced lower traffic from their customers. Food cost inflation, which we began to experience at high levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and which prevailed through the first half of fiscal 2009, moderated in the second half of fiscal 2009. These factors negatively impacted sales and operating income in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. The decline in the financial markets had an additional impact on our operating income because Sysco invests in life insurance policies in order to provide for certain retirement programs. The value of our investments in corporate-owned life insurance policies is largely based on the values of underlying investments, which include publicly traded securities. Due to the decline in the financial markets, we have experienced losses in the cash surrender values of these policies, which has reduced operating income.  

 Sales decreased 1.8% in fiscal 2009 over the comparable prior year period to $36,853,330,000 primarily due to deteriorating economic conditions and the resulting impact on consumer spending. Inflation, as measured by product cost increases, was an estimated 4.7% during fiscal 2009. Operating income decreased to $1,872,211,000, or 5.1% of sales, a 0.4% decrease over the prior year. Our operating companies have continued to manage their businesses effectively in a difficult environment, which is demonstrated by the fact that the decrease in operating income was less than the decrease in sales. Basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2009 were both $1.77, a decrease of 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively, from the comparable prior year period. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted by accruals for tax contingencies and the non-deductibility of the losses recorded on corporate-owned life insurance.  

 Operating income for fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted by the combined effect of increased losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and an increase in the provision for losses on receivables. The negative impact of these additional expenses was more than offset by lower pay-related expenses related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation and operating efficiencies. In addition, our fuel costs increased in fiscal 2009, driven by higher contracted fuel prices as compared to fiscal 2008. We partially offset the impact of these higher fuel costs through fuel usage reduction measures and fuel surcharges.  

Overview  

 Sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. Our operations are primarily located throughout the United States, Canada and Ireland and include broadline companies, specialty produce companies, custom-cut meat operations, hotel supply operations, SYGMA (our chain restaurant distribution subsidiary) and a company that distributes to international customers.  

 We consider our primary market to be the foodservice market in the United States and Canada and estimate that we serve about 17% of this approximately $215 billion annual market. According to industry sources, the foodservice, or food-away-from-home, market represents approximately 48% of the total dollars spent on food purchases made at the consumer level in the United States. This share grew from about 37% in 1972 to nearly 50% in 1998 and did not change materially until 2008 when it declined to the current level of 48%.  

 Industry sources estimate the total foodservice market in the United States experienced a real sales decline of approximately 3.6% in calendar year 2008 and real sales growth of 0.2% in calendar year 2007. Real sales growth and declines do not include the impact of inflation or deflation.  

 General economic conditions and consumer confidence can affect the frequency of purchases and amounts spent by consumers for food-away-from-home and, in turn, can impact our customers and our sales. We believe the current general economic conditions, including pressure on consumer disposable income, are contributing to a decline in the foodservice market. Historically, we have grown at a faster rate than the overall industry and have grown our market share in this fragmented industry. We intend to continue our efforts to expand our market share and grow earnings by focusing on sales growth, margin management, productivity gains and supply chain management.  

14   
Strategy  

 We intend to continue to expand our market share and grow earnings through strategies which include:  

      Sales growth: We intend to grow sales by gaining an increased share of products purchased by existing customers, development of new customers, the use of foldouts (new operating companies created in established markets previously served by other Sysco operating companies), investment in new technologies and a disciplined acquisition program. Our business review program, which is designed to help our customers grow their business, and the size and expertise of our sales force are key factors in maintaining and growing sales.  

      Lowering Procurement Costs: We intend to lower our cost of goods sold by leveraging Syscos purchasing power and procurement expertise and capitalizing on an end-to-end view of our supply chain. Our National Supply Chain initiative is focused on lowering inventory, inbound freight, product costs, operating costs, working capital requirements and future facility expansion needs at our operating companies while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers. A component of our National Supply Chain initiative is the use of redistribution centers (RDCs) which aggregate inventory demand to optimize the supply chain activities for certain products for all Sysco broadline operating companies in a geographic region. We currently have two RDCs located in Virginia and Florida and have purchased the land for a third RDC in Indiana.  

      Productivity Gains: We intend to optimize warehouse and delivery activities across the corporation and manage energy consumption to achieve a more efficient delivery of products to our customers.  

      Enhanced Technology Platform: During fiscal 2009, we commenced the design of an enterprise-wide project to implement an integrated software system to support the majority of our business processes. The goal of the project is to create a new technology platform that simplifies and standardizes our business model, which we believe will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations.    

 We will continue to use our strategies to leverage our market leadership position to continuously improve how we buy, handle and market products for our customers. Our primary focus is on growing and optimizing the core foodservice distribution business in North America; however, we will continue to explore and identify opportunities to grow our global capabilities in other markets. As a part of our ongoing strategic analysis, we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses.

Sales  

 Sales for fiscal 2009 were 1.8% less than fiscal 2008. Product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices had a significant impact on sales levels in fiscal 2009. Estimated product cost increases, an internal measure of inflation, were approximately 4.7% during fiscal 2009. The changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars negatively impacted sales by 1.2% compared to fiscal 2008. Non-comparable acquisitions offset the rate of sales decline by 0.2% for fiscal 2009.  

 Sales for fiscal 2008 were 7.1% greater than fiscal 2007. Product cost inflation and the resulting increase in selling prices had a significant impact on sales levels in fiscal 2008. Estimated product cost increases, an internal measure of inflation, were approximately 6.0% during fiscal 2008. The changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars increased sales by 1.0% compared to fiscal 2007. Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 0.1% to the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2008.  

 Our sequential quarterly sales trend has demonstrated a continuing decline throughout fiscal 2008 and 2009 from a positive 8.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 to a negative 6.6% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We believe the deteriorating economic conditions, which are placing pressure on consumer disposable income, are contributing to a decline in real volume in the foodservice market and, in turn, have contributed to a reduction in our sales. We believe we will continue to experience a difficult economic environment into fiscal 2010. Thus far in fiscal 2010, we have experienced moderate deflation. Both of these conditions will make it challenging to grow sales in fiscal 2010; however, if underlying economic conditions improve during fiscal 2010, we believe our trend of sequential quarterly sales decline may reverse.  

 We believe that our continued focus on the use of business reviews and business development activities, investment in customer contact personnel and the efforts of our marketing associates and sales support personnel are key drivers to strengthening customer relationships and growing sales with new and existing customers. We also believe these activities help our customers in this difficult economic environment.  

Operating Income  

 Cost of sales primarily includes product costs, net of vendor consideration and in-bound freight. Operating expenses include the costs of facilities, product handling, delivery, selling and general and administrative activities.  

 Operating income decreased 0.4% in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 to $1,872,211,000, or 5.1% of sales. Operating income declined primarily due to a decline in sales, partially offset by a decline in operating expenses. Gross margin dollars decreased 2.2% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, and operating expenses decreased 2.8% in fiscal 2009.  

 Operating income increased 10.0% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 to $1,879,949,000, or 5.0% of sales. Operating income increased primarily due to an increase in sales, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Gross margin dollars increased 6.5% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, and operating expenses increased 5.3% in fiscal 2008.  

16   
 Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, Sysco began experiencing high levels of product cost increases in numerous product categories. These increases persisted throughout fiscal 2008 at levels approximating 6.0% and rose even higher to 7.6% in the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2009. The level of product cost increases began moderating during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and was 0.5% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Generally, Sysco attempts to pass increased costs to its customers; however, because of contractual and competitive reasons, we are not able to pass along all of the product cost increases immediately. Prolonged periods of high inflation, such as those we have recently experienced, have a negative impact on our customers, as high food costs and fuel costs can reduce consumer spending in the food-prepared-away-from home market. As a result, these factors may negatively impact our sales, gross margins and earnings. We may also be negatively impacted by periods of prolonged product cost deflation because we make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup. As a result, our profit levels may be negatively impacted during periods of product cost deflation, even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant.  

 We believe the operating expense performance for fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 was aided by operating efficiencies and lower payroll expense related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation. The positive impact of these expense reductions was partially offset by the combined effect of increased losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and an increase in the provision for losses on receivables. In addition, our fuel costs increased during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008.  

 Operating expenses in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 were negatively impacted by the combined impact of losses on the adjustment of the carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values and increased provisions related to multi-employer pension plans. The negative impact of these expense increases was partially offset by lower share-based compensation expense and lower company-sponsored pension expenses. In addition, our fuel costs increased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. We increased our use of fuel surcharges to offset a portion of these increased costs, thereby partially reducing the impact to operating income.  

 We adjust the carrying values of our corporate-owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values on an ongoing basis. The cash surrender values of these policies are largely based on the values of underlying investments, which include publicly traded securities. As a result, the cash surrender values of these policies will fluctuate with changes in the market value of such securities. The performance in the financial markets resulted in losses for these policies of $43,812,000 in fiscal 2009, losses of $8,718,000 in fiscal 2008 and gains of $23,922,000 in fiscal 2007. The performance of the financial markets will continue to influence the cash surrender values of our corporate-owned life insurance policies, which could cause volatility in operating income, net earnings and earnings per share.  

 The provision for losses on receivables included within operating expenses increased by $42,454,000 in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008. The current economic conditions and related decrease in consumer demand combined with tightening credit markets have impacted the liquidity of some of our customers, resulting in an increase in delinquent payments on accounts receivable. Customer accounts written off, net of recoveries, were $71,877,000, or 0.20% of sales, $32,367,000, or 0.09% of sales, and $26,010,000 or 0.07% of sales, for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The increase in our provision for losses on receivables is related to customer accounts across our customer base without concentration in any specific location. We continue to monitor our customer account balances and our credit policies and believe continued strong credit practices will be necessary to avoid significant increases in our provision for losses on receivables. However, if the difficult economic environment persists, we expect to continue to experience higher levels of provision for losses on receivables and higher levels of write-offs, such as those experienced in fiscal 2009, in fiscal 2010.  

 Pay-related expenses decreased by $192,086,000 in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008. The reduction was due to a combination of reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation. Headcount declines occurred due to both productivity improvements and workforce reductions commensurate with lower sales. The criteria for paying annual bonuses to our corporate officers and certain portions of operating company management bonuses are tied to overall company performance. The overall company performance criteria for payment of such bonuses for fiscal 2009 were not met; therefore corporate executive officers will not receive bonuses for fiscal 2009 and operating company management bonuses are at lower levels for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008.  

 Syscos fuel costs increased by $33,154,000 in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 primarily due to increased contracted diesel prices. Our fuel costs increased by $34,023,000 in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 due to increased market diesel prices. Syscos costs per gallon increased 18.6% in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 and 18.7% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. Syscos activities to manage increased fuel costs include reducing miles driven by our trucks through improved routing techniques, improving fleet utilization by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharges were approximately $5,000,000 higher in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 and $27,000,000 higher in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007. Usage of these surcharges was greater in the second half of fiscal 2008 and first half of fiscal 2009, due to sustained, increased market diesel prices during that period. Fuel surcharges are reflected within sales and gross margins.  

17   
 We periodically enter into forward purchase commitments for a portion of our projected monthly diesel fuel requirements. In fiscal 2009, the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated $68,000,000 of additional fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were higher than market prices for the contracted volumes. In fiscal 2008, the forward purchase commitments resulted in an estimated $21,000,000 of avoided fuel costs as the fixed price contracts were generally lower than market prices for the contracted volumes. In fiscal 2007, the forward purchase commitments resulted in prices that were comparable to market prices.  

 As of June 27, 2009, we had forward diesel fuel commitments totaling approximately $64,000,000 through March 2010. In July 2009, we entered additional forward purchase commitments totaling approximately $16,000,000 at a fixed price through June 2010. Together, these contracts will lock in the price of approximately 40% of our fuel purchase needs for fiscal 2010. Our commitments through August 2009 were entered into at prevailing rates from mid-July through mid-August 2008. As a result, these contracts are at fixed prices greater than both the prices incurred during same periods in the previous fiscal year and current market prices. The remainder of our outstanding contracts were entered into at the prevailing rates in March, April and July 2009 and thus the fixed price on these contracts reflects the lower current market price for diesel.  

 Fuel costs in fiscal 2010, exclusive of any amounts recovered through fuel surcharges, are expected to decrease by approximately $50,000,000 to $80,000,000 as compared to fiscal 2009. Our estimate is based upon the prevailing market prices for diesel in mid-August 2009, the cost committed to in our forward fuel purchase agreements currently in place for fiscal 2010 and estimates of fuel consumption. Actual fuel costs could vary from our estimates if any of these assumptions change, in particular if future fuel prices vary significantly from our current estimates. We continue to evaluate all opportunities to offset potential increases in fuel expense, including the use of fuel surcharges and overall expense management. However, consistent with the lower current market price for diesel, we expect fuel surcharge revenue to be significantly lower in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009, declining by as much as $60,000,000.  

 Share-based compensation cost in fiscal 2009 was $24,620,000 less than in fiscal 2008. Share-based compensation expense decreased $17,335,000 in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007. Contributing to the decrease in both years was a reduction in the level of option grants being awarded compared to previous years, resulting in reduced compensation expenses being recognized. Also affecting the decrease in fiscal 2009 was the removal of the previous stock award component from the Management Incentive Plan annual bonus awards beginning with fiscal 2009. As a result, the share-based compensation expense related to the stock award component of the incentive bonuses recorded in previous years was not incurred in fiscal 2009, and overall share-based compensation expense was reduced as compared to the prior year. Beginning in fiscal 2010, we expect to replace the stock award component of the incentive bonuses with annual discretionary grants of restricted equity awards subject to time-based vesting. Share-based compensation expense in fiscal 2010 is expected to increase by $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 relative to fiscal 2009 due primarily to the anticipated discretionary grant of restricted awards in fiscal 2010.  

 Net company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2009 were $22,877,000 higher than fiscal 2008, due primarily to the recognition of actuarial losses from lower returns on assets of Syscos company-sponsored qualified pension plan (Retirement Plan) during fiscal 2008 and the merging of participants from a multi-employer pension plan the Retirement Plan (see Multi-Employer Pension Plans at Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Considerations), partially offset by a decrease in expense due to an increase in the discount rates used to calculate the plans liabilities and amendments to our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). Net company-sponsored pension costs decreased $8,754,000 in fiscal 2008 over the prior year, due primarily to the funding status and the projected asset performance of the Retirement Plan at that time. Net company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2010 are expected to increase by approximately $37,000,000 over fiscal 2009 due primarily to lower returns on assets of the Retirement Plan during fiscal 2009, partially offset by an increase in the discount rates used to calculate our projected benefit obligation and related pension expense for fiscal 2010.  

 We recorded provisions related to multi-employer pension plans of $9,585,000 in fiscal 2009, $22,284,000 in fiscal 2008 and $4,700,000 in fiscal 2007. See additional discussion of multi-employer pension plans at Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Considerations.  

Net Earnings  

 Net earnings declined 4.5% in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due primarily to the impact of changes in income taxes discussed below, as well as the factors discussed above. Net earnings increased 10.5% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 due primarily to the factors discussed above, as well as the impact of changes in income taxes discussed below.  

 The effective tax rate was 40.37% in fiscal 2009, 38.25% in fiscal 2008 and 38.25% in fiscal 2007.  

 The effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was negatively impacted primarily by two factors. First, the company recorded tax adjustments related to federal and state tax contingencies of $31,000,000. Second, the loss of $43,812,000, which had a tax effect of $16,824,000, recorded to adjust the carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values was non-deductible for income tax purposes and had the impact of increasing the effective tax rate for the period. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was favorably impacted by the reversal of valuation allowances of $7,800,000 previously recorded on Canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets.  

18   
 The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was favorably impacted by tax benefits of approximately $7,700,000 resulting from the recognition of a net operating loss deferred tax asset which arose due to a state tax law change, $8,600,000 related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously recorded on Canadian net operating loss deferred tax assets and $5,500,000 related to the reduction in net Canadian deferred tax liabilities due to a federal tax rate reduction. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was negatively impacted by the recording of tax and interest related to uncertain tax positions, share-based compensation expense and the recognition of losses of $8,718,000, which had a tax effect of $3,348,000, recorded to adjust the carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values.  

 The effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was favorably impacted by the recognition of gains of $23,922,000, which had a tax effect of $9,186,000, recorded to adjust the carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies to their cash surrender values. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 was negatively impacted by the recognition of tax and interest for tax contingencies.  

 Syscos affiliate, Baugh Supply Chain Cooperative (BSCC), is a cooperative taxed under subchapter T of the United States Internal Revenue Code the operation of which has resulted in a deferral of tax payments. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in connection with its audits of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns proposed adjustments that would have accelerated amounts that we had previously deferred and would have resulted in the payment of interest on those deferred amounts. Sysco reached a settlement with the IRS on August 21, 2009 to cease paying U.S. federal taxes related to BSCC on a deferred basis, pay the amounts currently recorded within deferred taxes related to BSCC over a three year period and make a one-time payment of $41,000,000, of which approximately $39,000,000 is non-deductible. The settlement addresses the BSCC deferred tax issue as it relates to the IRS audit of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns, and settles the matter for all subsequent periods, including the 2007 and 2008 federal income tax returns already under audit. We had previously accrued interest during the period of appeals and as a result of the settlement with the IRS, Sysco will record an income tax benefit of approximately $30,000,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.  

Earnings Per Share  

 Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share decreased 3.3% and 2.2%, respectively, in fiscal 2009 from the prior year. Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share increased 13.0% and 13.1%, respectively, in fiscal 2008 over the prior year. These changes were primarily the result of factors discussed above, as well as a net reduction in shares outstanding. The net reduction in average shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases. The net reduction in diluted shares outstanding was primarily due to share repurchases and an increase in the number of anti-dilutive options excluded from the diluted shares calculation.  

 As a result of the IRS settlement noted above, Sysco will record an income tax benefit of approximately $30,000,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We expect this to positively impact our diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.05 per share.  

Segment Results  

 We have aggregated our operating companies into a number of segments, of which only Broadline and SYGMA are reportable segments as defined in accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise. The accounting policies for the segments are the same as those disclosed by Sysco within the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data within Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Intersegment sales generally represent specialty produce and meat company products distributed by the Broadline and SYGMA operating companies. The segment results include certain centrally incurred costs for shared services that are charged to our segments. These centrally incurred costs are charged based upon the relative level of service used by each operating company consistent with how management views the performance of its operating segments.  

 Management evaluates the performance of each of our operating segments based on its respective operating income results, which include the allocation of certain centrally incurred costs. While a segments operating income may be impacted in the short term by increases or decreases in margins, expenses, or a combination thereof, over the long-term each business segment is expected to increase its operating income at a greater rate than sales growth. This is consistent with our long-term goal of leveraging earnings growth at a greater rate than sales growth.

Broadline Segment  

 Broadline operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to customers. Broadline operations have significantly higher operating margins than the rest of Syscos operations. In fiscal 2009, the Broadline operating results represented approximately 79% of Syscos overall sales and 94% of the aggregate operating income of Syscos segments, which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments.  

 There are several factors which contribute to these higher operating results as compared to the SYGMA and Other operating segments. We have invested substantial amounts in assets, operating methods, technology and management expertise in this segment. The breadth of its sales force, geographic reach of its distribution area and its purchasing power allow us to leverage this segments earnings.  

Sales  

 Sales for fiscal 2009 were 2.0% less than fiscal 2008. The changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars negatively impacted sales by 1.5% compared to fiscal 2008. Non-comparable acquisitions contributed 0.2% to the overall sales comparison for fiscal 2009. Case volume declines attributable to the impact of the current business  

20   
environment caused a decline in sales in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Product cost inflation, which led to increases in selling prices, partially offset case volume declines in fiscal 2009. 

 Sales for fiscal 2008 were 8.1% greater than fiscal 2007. The changes in the exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. dollars increased sales by 1.3% compared to fiscal 2007. Non-comparable acquisitions did not have a material impact on the overall sales growth rate for fiscal 2008. Product cost inflation, and the resulting increases in selling prices, was the primary contributor to sales growth. In addition, fiscal 2008 growth was realized both from increased sales to multi-unit customers and marketing associate-served customers primarily through continued focus on customer account penetration through the efforts of our marketing associates and the use of business reviews with customers.  

Operating Income  

 The increase in operating income in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008 was primarily due to effective management of operations in the current economic environment. Effective management was also evidenced by margins declining at a lower rate than our sales decline and by decreasing expenses as compared to the comparable prior year periods. Gross margin dollars decreased 1.7% while operating expenses decreased 3.2% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Expense performance for fiscal 2009 was aided by lower payroll-related expenses related to reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation and operating efficiencies, partially offset by an increase in the provision for losses on receivables.  

 The increase in operating income in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007 was primarily due to gross margin dollars increasing at a faster pace than expenses. We were able to manage our business effectively in the inflationary environment that existed in fiscal 2008 by managing margins and improving operating efficiencies. Gross margin dollars increased 7.0% while operating expenses increased 6.0% in fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007.  

 The high cost of fuel also impacted our Broadline segments results for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Fuel costs were $28,818,000 higher in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008. Fuel costs for fiscal 2008 were $21,575,000 higher than fiscal 2007. We attempt to mitigate increased fuel costs by reducing miles driven, improving fleet consumption by adjusting idling time and maximum speeds and using fuel surcharges. In the second half of fiscal 2008 and first half of fiscal 2009, our usage of fuel surcharges increased due to sustained increased market diesel prices. Fuel surcharges were approximately $9,000,000 higher in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008 and $21,000,000 higher in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007. Consistent with the lower current market price for diesel, we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our Broadline segment to be lower in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.  

 We recorded provisions related to multi-employer pension plans of $9,585,000 in fiscal 2009, $22,284,000 in fiscal 2008 and $4,700,000 in fiscal 2007.  

SYGMA Segment  

 SYGMA operating companies distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations. SYGMA operations have traditionally had lower operating income as a percentage of sales than Syscos other segments. This segment of the foodservice industry has generally been characterized by lower overall operating margins as the volume that these customers command allows them to negotiate for reduced margins. These operations service chain restaurants through contractual agreements that are typically structured on a fee per case delivered basis.  

Sales  

 Sales for fiscal 2009 were 5.8% greater than fiscal 2008 and 4.4% greater in fiscal 2008 than fiscal 2007. Although our SYGMA segment has been negatively impacted by deteriorating economic conditions, it achieved sales growth in both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, primarily due to significant contracts with new customers and product cost increases, which led to increases in selling prices. These increases were partially offset by lost sales due to the elimination of unprofitable business and lower case volumes due to difficult economic conditions impacting SYGMAs existing customer base.  

 One chain restaurant customer (Wendys/Arbys Group, Inc.) accounted for approximately 33% of the SYGMA segment sales for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2009. SYGMA maintains multiple regional contracts with varied expiration dates with this customer. While the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on SYGMA, we do not believe that the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on Sysco as a whole.  

Operating Income  

 Operating income increased in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Gross margin dollars increased 0.4% while operating expenses decreased 5.1% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Expense reductions were accomplished by operational efficiencies in both delivery and warehouse areas, as well as lower payroll expense related to headcount reductions.  

21   
 Operating income in fiscal 2008 decreased as compared to fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, SYGMA expensed $5,587,000 related to the write-off of software development costs. In addition, some of SYGMAs customers experienced a slowdown in their business resulting in lower cases per delivery and therefore reduced gross margin dollars per stop. Expense reductions were accomplished by consolidating regional offices, reducing headcounts and not renewing unprofitable customer contracts.  

 The high cost of fuel also impacted our SYGMA segments results for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008. Fuel costs were $2,028,000 higher in fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008. Fuel costs for fiscal 2008 were $8,888,000 higher than fiscal 2007. SYGMA was able to partially offset these costs through increases in the fees charged to customers, including fuel surcharges, and by reducing expenses. Fuel surcharges were approximately $5,000,000 lower in fiscal 2009 than in fiscal 2008 and $6,000,000 higher in fiscal 2008 than in fiscal 2007. Consistent with the lower current market price for diesel, we expect fuel costs and fuel surcharges for our SYGMA segment to be lower in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.  

Other Segment  

 Other financial information is attributable to our other operating segments, including our specialty produce, custom-cut meat and lodging industry products and a company that distributes to international customers. These operating segments are discussed on an aggregate basis as they do not represent reportable segments under segment accounting literature.  

 On an aggregate basis, our Other segment has had a lower operating income as a percentage of sales than Syscos Broadline segment. Sysco has acquired the operating companies within these segments in relatively recent years. These operations generally operate in a niche within the foodservice industry. These operations are also generally smaller in sales and scope than an average Broadline operation and each of these segments is considerably smaller in sales and overall scope than the Broadline segment. In fiscal 2009, in the aggregate, the Other segment represented approximately 8.8% of Syscos overall sales and 4.9% of the aggregate operating income of Syscos segments, which excludes corporate expenses and consolidated adjustments.  

 Operating income decreased 25.8% for fiscal 2009 over fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating income was caused primarily by reduced sales in all segments attributable to the deteriorating economic environment.  

 Operating income increased 3.0% for fiscal 2008 over fiscal 2007. The increase in operating income was generated primarily by improved results in the specialty produce and the lodging industry segments offset by reduced sales and operating income in the custom-cut meat segment.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 Syscos strategic objectives require continuing investment. Our resources include cash provided by operations and access to capital from financial markets. Our operations historically have produced significant cash flow. Cash generated from operations is first allocated to working capital requirements; investments in facilities, systems, fleet and other equipment; cash dividends; and acquisitions compatible with our overall growth strategy. In addition, this cash will be used to satisfy the requirements of the IRS settlement over the next three years. Any remaining cash generated from operations may be invested in high-quality, short-term instruments or applied toward a portion of the cost of the share repurchase program. As a part of our on-going strategic analysis, we regularly evaluate business opportunities, including potential acquisitions and sales of assets and businesses, and our overall capital structure. These transactions may materially impact our liquidity, borrowing capacity, leverage ratios and capital availability.  

 We believe that our cash flows from operations, the availability of additional capital under our existing commercial paper programs and bank lines of credit and our ability to access capital from financial markets in the future, including issuances of debt securities under our shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements over at least the next twelve months, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes. During the recent tightening of the credit markets, we have continued to maintain the highest credit rating available for commercial paper. We believe that we will continue to be able to access the commercial paper market effectively. We also issued long-term senior notes totaling $500,000,000 under our shelf registration statement during the third quarter of fiscal 2009 in order to take advantage of the interest rates available to us at that time and to enhance our liquidity position. We believe that we will continue to be able to access the long-term capital market effectively.  

Operating Activities  

 We generated $1,582,341,000 in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009, $1,596,129,000 in fiscal 2008 and $1,402,922,000 in fiscal 2007. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to net income, reduced by decreases in accounts payable balances and accrued expenses, offset by decreases in accounts receivable balances and inventory balances and an increase in accrued income taxes. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2008 was primarily due to net income, reduced by decreases in accrued income taxes and increases in accounts receivable balances and inventory balances, partially offset by a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets. Cash flow from operations in fiscal 2007 was primarily due to net  

22   
income, reduced by decreases in accrued income taxes and increases in accounts receivable balances, inventory balances and prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by increases in accrued expenses and accounts payable balances. 

 The decrease in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the sales decline. The increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were primarily due to sales growth. The decrease in accounts payable balances in fiscal 2009 was primarily from inventory decreases resulting from the sales decline. The increases in accounts payable balances in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were primarily due to inventory increases resulting from sales growth. Accounts payable balances are impacted by many factors, including changes in product mix, cash discount terms and changes in payment terms with vendors.  

 Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by decreases in accrued expenses of $120,314,000 during fiscal 2009 and $22,721,000 during fiscal 2008 and positively impacted by an increase in accrued expenses of $132,936,000 during fiscal 2007. The decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the payment of prior year annual incentive bonuses, offset by lower accruals for current year incentive bonuses. The decrease in accrued expenses during fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the reversal of a product liability claim which is further explained below. This decrease was partially offset by increased accrued interest due to fixed-rate debt issued in fiscal 2008 and an increase to a provision related to a multi-employer pension plan. See additional discussion of multi-employer pension plans at Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Considerations. The increase in accrued expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily due to increased accruals for fiscal 2007 incentive bonuses due to improved operating results over fiscal 2006.  

 In fiscal 2007, we recorded a liability for a product liability claim of $50,296,000 and the corresponding insurance receivable of $48,296,000, included within prepaid expenses and other current assets. In fiscal 2008, these amounts were reversed as our insurance carrier and other parties paid the full amount of the judgment in excess of our deductible. See further discussion of the product liability claim under Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  

 Other long-term liabilities and prepaid pension cost, net, decreased $48,380,000 during fiscal 2009, increased $13,459,000 during fiscal 2008 and decreased $14,817,000 in fiscal 2007. The decrease in fiscal 2009 is primarily attributable to a decrease in our liability for uncertain tax benefits. See additional discussion of an IRS settlement at Liquidity and Capital Resources, Other Considerations. The decrease was partially offset by a combination of the recording of net company-sponsored pension costs and incentive compensation deferrals. The increase for fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to a combination of the recording of net company-sponsored pension costs, incentive compensation deferrals and a net increase to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by pension contributions to our company-sponsored plans. The decrease in fiscal 2007 was due to pension contributions to our company-sponsored plans exceeding the amount of net company-sponsored pension costs recognized during the year. We recorded net company-sponsored pension costs of $88,714,000, $65,837,000 and $74,591,000 during fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. Our contributions to our company-sponsored defined benefit plans were $95,776,000, $92,670,000 and $91,163,000 during fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. We expect to contribute approximately $160,000,000 to our company-sponsored defined benefit plans in fiscal 2010.  

Investing Activities  

 Fiscal 2009 capital expenditures included:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Fiscal 2008 capital expenditures included:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Fiscal 2007 capital expenditures included:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

23   
 We expect total capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 to be in the range of $600,000,000 to $650,000,000. Fiscal 2010 expenditures will include the continuation of the fold-out program; facility, fleet and other equipment replacements and expansions; and investments in technology.  

 During fiscal 2009, in the aggregate, the company paid cash of $218,075,000 for operations acquired during fiscal 2009 and for contingent consideration related to operations acquired in previous fiscal years. During fiscal 2009, we acquired for cash broadline foodservice operations in Ireland, Los Angeles, California and Boston, Massachusetts, as well as a produce distributor in Toronto, Ontario.  

Financing Activities  

Equity  

 We traditionally have engaged in Board-approved share repurchase programs. The number of shares acquired and their cost during the past three fiscal years were 16,951,200 shares for $438,843,000 in fiscal 2009, 16,769,900 shares for $529,179,000 in fiscal 2008 and 16,231,200 shares for $550,865,000 in fiscal 2007. As of August 12, 2009, there was a remaining authorization by our Board of Directors to repurchase up to 9,386,600 shares. We expect to repurchase significantly fewer shares in fiscal 2010 than in previous years.  

 Dividends paid were $548,246,000, or $0.92 per share, in fiscal 2009, $497,467,000, or $0.82 per share, in fiscal 2008 and $445,416,000, or $0.72 per share, in fiscal 2007. In May 2009, we declared our regular quarterly dividend for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 of $0.24 per share, which was paid in July 2009.  

 In November 2000, we filed with the SEC a shelf registration statement covering 30,000,000 shares of common stock to be offered from time to time in connection with acquisitions. As of August 12, 2009, 29,477,835 shares remained available for issuance under this registration statement.  

Short-term Borrowings  

 We have uncommitted bank lines of credit, which provided for unsecured borrowings for working capital of up to $88,000,000, of which none was outstanding as of June 27, 2009 or August 12, 2009.  

 Our Irish subsidiary, Pallas Foods Limited, has a 20,000,000 (Euro) committed facility for unsecured borrowings for working capital, which expires March 31, 2010. There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of June 27, 2009 or August 12, 2009.  

Commercial Paper  

 We have a Board-approved commercial paper program allowing us to issue short-term unsecured notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,300,000,000.  

 Sysco and one of our subsidiaries, Sysco International, Co., have a revolving credit facility supporting our U.S. and Canadian commercial paper programs. The facility, in the amount of $1,000,000,000, expires on November 4, 2012, but is subject to extension.  

 During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, aggregate outstanding commercial paper issuances and short-term bank borrowings ranged from approximately zero to $164,998,000, zero to $1,133,241,000, $356,804,000 to $755,180,000, respectively. There were no commercial paper issuances outstanding as of June 27, 2009 or August 12, 2009.  

Fixed Rate Debt  

 In April 2007, we repaid at maturity our 7.25% senior notes totaling $100,000,000 utilizing a combination of cash flow from operations and commercial paper issuances.  

 In January 2008, the SEC granted our request to terminate our then existing shelf registration statement that was filed with the SEC in April 2005 for the issuance of debt securities. In February 2008, we filed an automatically effective well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to $1,000,000,000 in debt securities with the SEC.  

 In February 2008, we issued 4.20% senior notes totaling $250,000,000 due February 12, 2013 (the 2013 notes) and 5.25% senior notes totaling $500,000,000 due February 12, 2018 (the 2018 notes) under our February 2008 shelf registration. The 2013 and 2018 notes, which were priced at 99.835% and 99.310% of par, respectively, are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows us to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at  

24   
the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by the early redemption. Proceeds from the notes were utilized to retire commercial paper issuances outstanding as of February 2008.  

 In February 2009, we deregistered the securities remaining unsold under our then existing shelf registration statement that was filed with the SEC in February 2008 for the issuance of debt securities. In February 2009, Sysco filed with the SEC an automatically effective well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities that may be issued from time to time.  

 In March 2009, Sysco issued 5.375% senior notes totaling $250,000,000 due March 17, 2019 (the 2019 notes) and 6.625% senior notes totaling $250,000,000 due March 17, 2039 (the 2039 notes) under our February 2009 shelf registration. The 2019 and 2039 notes, which were priced at 99.321% and 98.061% of par, respectively, are unsecured, are not subject to any sinking fund requirement and include a redemption provision which allows Sysco to retire the notes at any time prior to maturity at the greater of par plus accrued interest or an amount designed to ensure that the noteholders are not penalized by early redemption. Proceeds from the notes will be utilized over a period of time for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions, refinancing of debt, working capital, share repurchases and capital expenditures.  

Total Debt  

 Total debt as of June 27, 2009 was $2,476,649,000, of which approximately 99% was at fixed rates with a weighted average of 5.6% and the remainder was at floating rates with a weighted average of 1.3%. Certain loan agreements contain typical debt covenants to protect noteholders, including provisions to maintain our long-term debt to total capital ratio below a specified level. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of June 27, 2009.  

Other  

 As part of normal business activities, we issue letters of credit through major banking institutions as required by certain vendor and insurance agreements. As of June 27, 2009 and June 28, 2008, letters of credit outstanding were $74,679,000 and $35,785,000, respectively.  

Other Considerations  

Multi-Employer Pension Plans  

 As discussed in Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we contribute to several multi-employer defined benefit pension plans based on obligations arising under collective bargaining agreements covering union-represented employees.  

 Under current law regarding multi-employer defined benefit plans, a plans termination, our voluntary withdrawal or the mass withdrawal of all contributing employers from any underfunded multi-employer defined benefit plan would require us to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the multi-employer plans unfunded vested liabilities. Based on the most recent information available from plan administrators, our share of withdrawal liability on most of the multi-employer plans we participate in, some of which appear to be underfunded, was estimated to be $80,000,000 as of June 27, 2009 based on a voluntary withdrawal. Because we are not provided the information by the plan administrators on a timely basis and we expect that many multi-employer pension plans assets have declined due to recent stock market performance, we believe our share of the withdrawal liability could be greater.  

 Required contributions to multi-employer plans could increase in the future as these plans strive to improve their funding levels. In addition, the Pension Protection Act, enacted in August 2006, requires underfunded pension plans to improve their funding ratios within prescribed intervals based on the level of their underfunding. We believe that any unforeseen requirements to pay such increased contributions, withdrawal liability and excise taxes would be funded through cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity or a combination of these items. As of June 27, 2009, we have approximately $17,000,000 in liabilities recorded in total related to certain multi-employer defined benefit plans for which our voluntary withdrawal has already occurred, all of which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2010.  

 During fiscal 2008, we obtained information that a multi-employer pension plan we participated in failed to satisfy minimum funding requirements for certain periods and concluded that it was probable that additional funding would be required as well as the payment of excise tax. As a result, during fiscal 2008, we recorded a liability of approximately $16,500,000 related to our share of the minimum funding requirements and related excise tax for these periods. During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, we effectively withdrew from this multi-employer pension plan in an effort to secure benefits for our employees that were participants in the plan and to manage our exposure to this under-funded plan. We agreed to pay $15,000,000 to the plan, which included the minimum funding requirements. In connection with this withdrawal agreement, we merged active participants from this plan into Syscos company-sponsored Retirement Plan and assumed $26,704,000 in liabilities. The payment to the plan was made in the early part of the second quarter of fiscal 2009. If this plan were to undergo a mass  

25   
withdrawal, as defined by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, prior to September 2010, we could have additional liability. We do not currently believe a mass withdrawal from this plan prior to September 2010 is probable.  

 We have experienced other instances triggering voluntary withdrawal from multi-employer pension plans. Withdrawal liabilities incurred include $9,585,000 in fiscal 2009, $5,784,000 in fiscal 2008 and $4,700,000 in fiscal 2007.  

BSCC Cooperative Structure  

 Syscos affiliate, Baugh Supply Chain Cooperative (BSCC), is a cooperative taxed under subchapter T of the United States Internal Revenue Code the operation of which has resulted in a deferral of tax payments. The IRS, in connection with its audits of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns proposed adjustments that would have accelerated amounts that we had previously deferred and would have resulted in the payment of interest on those deferred amounts. Sysco reached a settlement with the IRS on August 21, 2009 to cease paying U.S. federal taxes related to BSCC on a deferred basis, pay the amounts currently recorded within deferred taxes related to BSCC over a three year period and make a one-time payment of $41,000,000, of which approximately $39,000,000 is non-deductible. The settlement addresses the BSCC deferred tax issue as it relates to the IRS audit of our 2003 through 2006 federal income tax returns, and settles the matter for all subsequent periods, including the 2007 and 2008 federal income tax returns already under audit. As a result of the settlement, we will pay the amounts owed in the following schedule:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Of the amounts to be paid in fiscal 2010 included in the table above, $316,000,000 will be paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and the remaining payments will be paid in quarterly installments beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Amounts to be paid in fiscal 2011 and 2012 will be paid with Syscos quarterly tax payments. We believe we have access to sufficient cash on hand, cash flows from operations and current access to capital to make payments on all of the amounts noted above.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Contractual Obligations  

 The following table sets forth, as of June 27, 2009, certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make contractual future payments:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 (1)   The estimate of the timing of future payments under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan involves the use of certain assumptions, including retirement ages and payout periods. Included in the < 1 Year amount are accelerated distributions to participants who took advantage during calendar year 2008 of a one-time opportunity, pursuant to certain transitional relief   

26   
     under the provisions of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, to elect to receive a distribution of all or a portion of their vested balances under the plan in early fiscal 2010.  

 (2)    Includes estimated contributions to the unfunded SERP and other postretirement benefit plans made in amounts needed to fund benefit payments for vested participants in these plans through fiscal 2019, based on actuarial assumptions.  

 (3)   Represents voluntary withdrawal liabilities recorded and excludes normal contributions required under our collective bargaining agreements.  

 (4)   Unrecognized tax benefits relate to uncertain tax positions recorded under accounting standards related to uncertain tax positions. As of June 27, 2009, we had a liability of $78,571,000 for unrecognized tax benefits for all tax jurisdictions and $146,998,000 for related interest that could result in cash payment. Sysco reached a settlement with the IRS on August 21, 2009 related to timing of tax payments. This will result in a one-time payment of $41,000,000 as well as accelerating the payments previously deferred. See further discussion of this settlement under Note 22, Subsequent Events, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Apart from this settlement, we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of non-current payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time, the related non-current balances have not been reflected in the Payments Due by Period section of the table.  

 (5)   Includes payments on floating rate debt based on rates as of June 27, 2009, assuming amount remains unchanged until maturity, and payments on fixed rate debt based on maturity dates.  

 (6)    Provides the estimated minimum contribution to the Retirement Plan through fiscal 2019 to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements.  

 (7)     For purposes of this table, purchase obligations include agreements for purchases of product in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed, including minimum quantities resulting from our sourcing initiative. Such amounts included in the table above are based on estimates. Purchase obligations also includes amounts committed with a third party to provide hardware and hardware hosting services over a ten year period ending in fiscal 2015 (See discussion under Note 19, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8), fixed electricity agreements and fixed fuel purchase commitments. Purchase obligations exclude full requirements electricity contracts where no stated minimum purchase volume is required.   

 Certain acquisitions involve contingent consideration, typically payable only in the event that certain operating results are attained or certain outstanding contingencies are resolved. Aggregate contingent consideration amounts outstanding as of June 27, 2009 included $78,250,000 in cash. This amount is not included in the table above.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses in the accompanying financial statements. Significant accounting policies employed by Sysco are presented in the notes to the financial statements.  

 Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations. These policies require our most subjective or complex judgments, often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and this related disclosure. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates pertain to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, self-insurance programs, company-sponsored pension plans, income taxes, vendor consideration, goodwill and intangible assets and share-based compensation.  

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  

 We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable and determine the appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts based on a combination of factors. We utilize specific criteria to determine uncollectible receivables to be written off, including whether a customer has filed for or has been placed in bankruptcy, has had accounts referred to outside parties for collection or has had accounts past due over specified periods. Allowances are recorded for all other receivables based on analysis of historical trends of write-offs and recoveries. In addition, in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligation, a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the receivable to the net amount reasonably expected to be collected. Our judgment is required as to the impact of certain of these items and other factors as to ultimate realization of our accounts receivable. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, as was the case in fiscal 2009, additional allowances may be required.  

27   
Self-Insurance Program  

 We maintain a self-insurance program covering portions of workers compensation, general liability and vehicle liability costs. The amounts in excess of the self-insured levels are fully insured by third party insurers. We also maintain a fully self-insured group medical program. Liabilities associated with these risks are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, medical cost trends, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Projections of future loss expenses are inherently uncertain because of the random nature of insurance claims occurrences and could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. In an attempt to mitigate the risks of workers compensation, vehicle and general liability claims, safety procedures and awareness programs have been implemented.  

Company-Sponsored Pension Plans  

 Amounts related to defined benefit plans recognized in the financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis. Three of the more critical assumptions in the actuarial calculations are the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets.  

 For guidance in determining the discount rates, we calculate the implied rate of return on a hypothetical portfolio of high-quality fixed-income investments for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximates the estimated payouts of the pension plan. The discount rate assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2009 net pension costs for the Retirement Plan, which was determined as of the June 28, 2008 measurement date, increased 0.16% to 6.94%. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2009 net pension costs for the SERP, which was determined as of the June 28, 2008 measurement date, increased 0.39% to 7.03%. The combined effect of these discount rate changes was a decrease in our net company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2009 by an estimated $8,692,000. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2010 net pension costs for the Retirement Plan, which was determined as of the June 27, 2009 measurement date, increased 1.08% to 8.02%. The discount rate for determining fiscal 2010 net pension costs for the SERP, which was determined as of the June 27, 2009 measurement date, increased 0.11% to 7.14%. The combined effect of these discount rate changes will decrease our net company-sponsored pension costs for all plans for fiscal 2010 by an estimated $38,600,000. A 1.0% increase in the discount rates for fiscal 2010 would decrease Syscos net company-sponsored pension cost by $34,100,000, while a 1.0% decrease in the discount rates would increase pension cost by $40,000,000. The impact of a 1.0% increase in the discount rates differs from the impact of a 1.0% decrease in discount rates because the liabilities are less sensitive to change at higher discount rates. Therefore, a 1.0% increase in the discount rate will not generate the same magnitude of change as a 1.0% decrease in the discount rate. As of June 27, 2009, our net actuarial losses from our company-sponsored pension plans were $534,892,000, an increase of $183,688,000. We estimate the amortization of net actuarial losses will increase our fiscal 2010 pension expense by approximately $23,000,000 as compared to fiscal 2009.  

 We look to actual plan experience in determining the rates of increase in compensation levels. We used a plan specific age-related set of rates for the Retirement Plan, which are equivalent to a single rate of 5.21% as of June 27, 2009 and 6.17% as of June 28, 2008. For determining the benefit obligations as of June 27, 2009, the SERP calculations use an age-graded salary growth assumption with reductions taken for determining fiscal 2010 pay due to base salary freezes in effect for fiscal 2010. As of June 28, 2008, the SERP assumes various levels of base salary increase and decrease for determining pay for fiscal 2009 depending upon the participants position with the company and a 7% salary growth assumption for all participants for fiscal 2010 and thereafter.  

 The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan was 8.00% for fiscal 2009 and 8.50% for fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption was changed to a net return on assets assumption, which contributed to the 0.50% decrease in the assumption to 8.00% in fiscal 2009. Prior to fiscal 2009, this assumption represented gross return on assets, and plan expenses were reflected within service cost. The expectations of future returns are derived from a mathematical asset model that incorporates assumptions as to the various asset class returns, reflecting a combination of historical performance analysis and the forward-looking views of the financial markets regarding the yield on long-term bonds and the historical returns of the major stock markets. Although not determinative of future returns, the effective annual rate of return on plan assets, developed using geometric/compound averaging, was approximately 7.4%, 2.0%, 0.5% and (29.4)% over the 20-year, 10-year, 5-year and 1-year periods ended December 31, 2008, respectively. In addition, in eight of the last 15 years, the actual return on plan assets has exceeded 10.0%. The rate of return assumption is reviewed annually and revised as deemed appropriate.  

 The expected return on plan assets impacts the recorded amount of net pension costs. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of the Retirement Plan is 8.00% for fiscal 2010. A 1.0% increase (decrease) in the assumed rate of return for fiscal 2010 would decrease (increase) Syscos net company-sponsored pension costs for fiscal 2010 by approximately $13,100,000.  

 Pension accounting standards require the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans in the statement of financial position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of June 28, 2008 was a charge, net of tax, of $220,913,000, which  

28   
represented the net actuarial losses, prior service costs and transition obligation remaining from the initial adoption of previous pension accounting standards as of that date. The amount reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit plans as of June 27, 2009 was a charge, net of tax, of $346,107,000.  

 Changes in the assumptions, including changes to the discount rate discussed above, together with the normal growth of the plans, the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions, increased net company-sponsored pension costs by approximately $25,800,000 in fiscal 2009. Increasing the net company-sponsored pension costs by approximately $4,300,000 in fiscal 2009 were additional costs related to the merger of participants from a multi-employer pension plan into Syscos company-sponsored Retirement Plan (see Multi-Employer Pension Plans under Other Considerations for further discussion). Decreasing the net company-sponsored pension costs by approximately $7,200,000 in fiscal 2009 was a change in the SERP design. The net impact of all of these changes was a net increase in fiscal 2009 in company-sponsored pension costs of $22,877,000. Changes in the assumptions, including changes to the discount rate discussed above, together with the normal growth of the plans, the impact of actuarial losses from prior periods and the timing and amount of contributions are expected to increase net company-sponsored pension costs in fiscal 2010 by approximately $37,000,000.  

 We made cash contributions to our company-sponsored pension plans of $95,776,000 and $92,670,000 in fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively, including voluntary contributions to the Retirement Plan of $80,000,000 and $80,000,000 in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively. Our minimum required contribution to the Retirement Plan for the calendar 2009 plan year is estimated at $95,000,000 to meet ERISA minimum funding requirements. Sysco will be required to pay quarterly contributions for the calendar 2010 plan year, the first installment of which must be made in fiscal 2010. We anticipate we will make $140,000,000 of contributions to the Retirement Plan in fiscal 2010. The estimated fiscal 2010 contributions to fund benefit payments for the SERP and other post-retirement plans together are approximately $19,817,000.  

Income Taxes  

 The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances, and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.  

 Prior to fiscal 2008, in evaluating the exposures connected with the various tax filing positions, we established an accrual when, despite our belief that our tax return positions were supportable, we believed that certain positions may be successfully challenged and a loss was probable. When facts and circumstances changed, these accruals were adjusted. Beginning in fiscal 2008, we adopted a new accounting standard, which changed our accounting for uncertain tax positions. This accounting standard provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position must be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. (See discussion under Note 17, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8).  

 Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. We believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable; however, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or pay amounts in excess of recorded liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution.  

Vendor Consideration  

 We recognize consideration received from vendors when the services performed in connection with the monies received are completed and when the related product has been sold by Sysco. There are several types of cash consideration received from vendors. In many instances, the vendor consideration is in the form of a specified amount per case or per pound. In these instances, we will recognize the vendor consideration as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold. In the situations where the vendor consideration is not related directly to specific product purchases, we will recognize these as a reduction of cost of sales when the earnings process is complete, the related service is performed and the amounts realized. In certain of these latter instances, the vendor consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific incremental identifiable cost incurred by Sysco. In these cases, we classify the consideration as a reduction of those costs with any excess funds classified as a reduction of cost of sales and recognize these in the period in which the costs are incurred and related services performed.  

29   
Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

 Goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired. Certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets, as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit.  

 In addition, annually or more frequently as needed, we assess the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles by determining whether the fair values of the applicable reporting units exceed the carrying values of these assets. The reporting units used in assessing goodwill impairment are our six operating segments as described in Note 20, Business Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The components within each of our six operating segments have similar economic characteristics and therefore are aggregated into six reporting units.  

 We arrive at our estimates of fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow and earnings multiple models. The results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for each of our six operating segments. The primary assumptions used in these various models include estimated earnings multiples of comparable acquisitions in the industry including control premiums, earnings multiples on acquisitions completed by Sysco in the past, future cash flow estimates of the reporting units, which are dependent on internal forecasts and projected growth rates, and weighted average cost of capital, along with working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We update our projections used in our discounted cash flow model based on historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units.  

 Actual results could differ from these assumptions and projections, resulting in the company revising its assumptions and, if required, recognizing an impairment loss. There were no impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles recorded in fiscal 2009, 2008 or 2007. Our past estimates of fair value for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 have not been materially different when revised to include subsequent years actual results. Sysco has not made any material changes in its impairment assessment methodology during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units. In fiscal 2009, the reporting units fair values would have had to have been lower by 16% compared to the fair values estimated in our impairment analysis before additional analysis would have been indicated to determine if an impairment existed for any of our reporting units.  

 The Other (specialty produce, custom-cut meat, lodging industry products and international distribution operations) operating segments have a greater proportion of goodwill recorded to estimated fair value as compared to the Broadline or SYGMA reporting units. This is primarily due to these businesses having been recently acquired, and as a result there has been less history of organic growth than in the Broadline and SYGMA segments. In addition, these businesses also have lower levels of cash flow than the Broadline segment. As such, these Other operating segments have a greater risk of future impairment if their operations were to suffer a significant downturn.  

Share-Based Compensation  

 We provide compensation benefits to employees and non-employee directors under several share-based payment arrangements including various employee stock incentive plans, the Employees Stock Purchase Plan, the Management Incentive Plan and various non-employee director plans.  

 As of June 27, 2009, there was $63,746,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to share-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.97 years.  

 The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of Syscos stock, implied volatilities from traded options on Syscos stock and other factors. We utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model; separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. Expected dividend yield is estimated based on the historical pattern of dividends and the average stock price for the year preceding the option grant. The risk-free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.  

 The fair value of the stock issued under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan is calculated as the difference between the stock price and the employee purchase price. The fair value of restricted stock granted to employees is based on the stock price on grant date. The application of a discount to the fair value of a restricted stock grant is dependent upon whether or not each individual grant contains a post-vesting restriction. The fair value of the stock issued under the Management Incentive Plans with respect to years prior to fiscal 2009 was based on the stock price on the last day of the fiscal year less a 12% discount for post-vesting restrictions. The discount for post-vesting restrictions was estimated based on restricted stock studies and by calculating the cost of a hypothetical protective put option over the restriction period. The stock award component of the Management Incentive Plan bonus awards was removed beginning in fiscal 2009.  

30   
 The compensation cost related to these share-based awards is recognized over the requisite service period. The requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.  

 The compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from awards under the Management Incentive Plan through fiscal 2008 was accrued over the fiscal year to which the incentive bonus related. The compensation cost related to stock issuances resulting from employee purchases of stock under the Employees Stock Purchase Plan is recognized during the quarter in which the employee payroll withholdings are made.  

 Certain of our option awards are generally subject to graded vesting over a service period. In those cases, we will recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. In other cases, certain of our option awards provide for graded vesting over a service period but include a performance-based provision allowing for the vesting to accelerate. In these cases, if it is probable that the performance condition will be met, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the shorter performance period; otherwise, we recognize compensation cost over the probable longer service period.  

 In addition, certain of our options provide that if the optionee retires at certain age and years of service thresholds, the options continue to vest as if the optionee continued to be an employee or director. In these cases, for awards granted prior to July 2, 2005 (our adoption date for the fair value recognition provisions in current stock compensation accounting standards), we will recognize the compensation cost for such awards over the remaining service period and accelerate any remaining unrecognized compensation cost when the employee retires. For awards granted subsequent to July 3, 2005, we will recognize compensation cost for such awards over the period from the date of grant to the date the employee first becomes eligible to retire with his options continuing to vest after retirement.  

 Our option grants include options that qualify as incentive stock options for income tax purposes. In the period the compensation cost related to incentive stock options is recorded, a corresponding tax benefit is not recorded as it is assumed that we will not receive a tax deduction related to such incentive stock options. We may be eligible for tax deductions in subsequent periods to the extent that there is a disqualifying disposition of the incentive stock option. In such cases, we would record a tax benefit related to the tax deduction in an amount not to exceed the corresponding cumulative compensation cost recorded in the financial statements on the particular options multiplied by the statutory tax rate.  

Accounting Changes  

SFAS 165 Adoption  

 In May 2009, the FASB issued SFAS No. 165, Subsequent Events ( SFAS 165), which establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. Specifically, the standard sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements, and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date. This standard became effective for Sysco for its fiscal year ending June 27, 2009. We have included the required disclosures for this standard in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.  

SFAS 161 Adoption  

 As of the third quarter of fiscal 2009, SFAS No. 161, Disclosure about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161) became effective for Sysco. SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entitys derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting. The company has determined that no additional disclosures were necessary upon adoption but will continue to assess the need for additional disclosures in future periods.  

SFAS 157 Adoption  

 As of June 29, 2008, Sysco adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 157,  Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis. SFAS 157 establishes a common definition for fair value under generally accepted accounting principles, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements. The adoption of SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis did not have a material impact on the companys financial statements. See also the discussion of FASB Staff Position 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, under New Accounting Standards below.  

31   
FIN 48 Adoption  

 As of July 1, 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes  an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). FIN 48 clarifies the application of SFAS 109 by defining criteria that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in the financial statements. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on the measurement, derecognition, classification and disclosure of tax positions, along with accounting for the related interest and penalties. As a result of this adoption, we recognized, as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, a $91,635,000 decrease in our beginning retained earnings on our July 1, 2007 balance sheet.  

SFAS 158  

 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans  an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R) (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 has two major provisions: the recognition and disclosure provision and the measurement date provision. We previously adopted SFAS 158s recognition and disclosure requirements as of June 30, 2007. The measurement date provision requires an employer to measure a plans assets and obligations as of the end of the employers fiscal year. We elected to early adopt the measurement date provision as of June 30, 2007 in order to adopt both provisions of this accounting standard at the same time. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2008, the measurement date for all plans returned to correspond with fiscal year-end. We performed measurements as of May 31, 2007 and June 30, 2007 of the plan assets and benefit obligations. We recorded a charge to beginning retained earnings on July 1, 2007 of $3,572,000, net of tax, for the impact of the difference in our company-sponsored pension expense between the two measurement dates. We also recorded a benefit to beginning accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on July 1, 2007 of $22,780,000, net of tax, for the impact of the difference in the recognition provision between the two measurement dates.  

New Accounting Standards  

SFAS 141(R)  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)), which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in a business combination. This statement also establishes recognition and measurement principles for the goodwill acquired in a business combination and disclosure requirements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. We will apply this statement primarily on a prospective basis for business combinations beginning in fiscal 2010. Earlier application of the standard was prohibited.  

FSP 157-2  

 In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP 157-2), which partially deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for one year for non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non-recurring basis. As a result of the deferral, SFAS 157 is effective in fiscal 2010 for non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value. Our only non-recurring, non-financial asset fair value measurements are those used in our annual test of recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, in which we determine whether estimated fair values of our applicable reporting units exceed their carrying values. We will apply the provisions of SFAS 157 in fiscal 2010 to this fair value estimation.  

FSP EITF 03-06-1  

 In June 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. EITF 03-06-1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03-06-1). FSP EITF 03-06-1 addresses whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and, therefore, need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share under the two-class method described in FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share. This standard will be effective for Sysco beginning in fiscal 2010 and interim periods within that year. All prior-period earnings per share data presented in filings subsequent to adoption must be adjusted retrospectively to conform with the provisions of this standard. Early application of FSP EITF 03-06-1 was not permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FSP EITF 03-06-1 will have on our consolidated financial statements.  

32   
FSP FAS 132(R)-1  

 In December 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 132(R)-1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets (FSP FAS 132(R)-1). FSP FAS 132(R)-1 amends SFAS No. 132(R), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, to require additional disclosures about assets held in an employers defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. This standard will be effective for Sysco in fiscal 2010, although early application of the standard is permitted. Upon initial application, the information required by FSP FAS 132(R)-1 is not required for earlier periods that are presented for comparative purposes. We will adopt this standard in fiscal 2010 and are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of FSP FAS 132(R)-1 will have on our annual financial statement disclosures.  

FSP FAS 141(R)-1  

 In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 141(R)-1, Accounting for Assets and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise From Contingencies (FSP FAS 141(R)-1). FSP FAS 141(R)-1 amends and clarifies SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, to address application issues raised by preparers, auditors, and members of the legal profession on initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. We will apply this standard on a prospective basis for business combinations beginning in fiscal 2010.  

FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1  

 In April 2009, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1, Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments (FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1). FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 amend FASB Statement No. 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, and APB Opinion No. 28, Interim Financial Reporting, to require disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies. Prior disclosure requirements only applied to annual financial statements. This standard is effective for interim reporting periods ending after June 15, 2009, which is the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for Sysco. We will provide the disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments required by FSP FAS 107-1 and APB 28-1 in our interim financial statement disclosures beginning in fiscal 2010.  

Forward-Looking Statements  

 Certain statements made herein that look forward in time or express managements expectations or beliefs with respect to the occurrence of future events are forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. They include statements about Syscos ability to increase its sales and market share and grow earnings, the continuing impact of economic conditions on consumer confidence and our business, sales and expense trends, anticipated multi-employer pension related liabilities and contributions to various multi-employer pension plans, the estimated impact of the IRS settlement, the impact of ongoing legal proceedings, the loss of SYGMAs largest customer not having a material adverse effect on Sysco as a whole, compliance with laws and government regulations not having a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, anticipated capital expenditures and the sources of financing for those capital expenditures, continued competitive advantages and positive results from strategic initiatives, anticipated company-sponsored pension plan liabilities, the availability and adequacy of insurance to cover liabilities, the impact of future adoption of accounting pronouncements, predictions regarding the impact of changes in estimates used in impairment analyses, the anticipated impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and Syscos ability to meet future cash requirements and remain profitable.  

 These statements are based on managements current expectations and estimates; actual results may differ materially due in part to the risk factors discussed at Item 1.A. above and elsewhere. In addition, the success of Syscos strategic initiatives could be affected by conditions in the economy and the industry and internal factors such as the ability to control expenses, including fuel costs. Company-sponsored pension plan liabilities are impacted by a number of factors including the discount rate for determining the current value of plan benefits, the assumption for the rate of increase in future compensation levels and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Legal proceedings are impacted by events, circumstances and individuals beyond the control of Sysco. The need for additional borrowing or other capital is impacted by factors that include capital expenditures or acquisitions in excess of those currently anticipated, stock repurchases at historical levels, or other unexpected cash requirements. The diluted earnings per share impact of the settlement is impacted by share repurchases and the number of anti-dilutive stock options excluded from the diluted shares calculation. The diluted earnings per share impact of the IRS settlement is impacted by share repurchases and the number of anti-dilutive stock options excluded from the diluted shares calculation. Predictions regarding the future adoption of accounting pronouncements involve estimates without the benefit of precedent, and if our estimates turn out to be materially incorrect, our assessment of the impact of the pronouncement could prove incorrect, as well. The anticipated impact of compliance with laws and regulations also involves the risk that estimates may turn out to be materially incorrect, and laws and regulations, as well as methods of enforcement, are subject to change.

 Item 7A.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
