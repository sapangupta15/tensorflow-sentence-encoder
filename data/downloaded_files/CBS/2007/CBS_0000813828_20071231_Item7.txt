 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Management's discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Descriptions of all documents incorporated by reference herein or included as exhibits hereto are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such documents so incorporated or included. Please see Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of this report for the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors.  

Overview  

 CBS Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires, the "Company" or "CBS Corp.") is comprised of the following segments: Television, Radio, Outdoor and Publishing. During 2006, the Company sold Paramount Parks to Cedar Fair, L.P. for $1.24 billion in cash. As a result, Paramount Parks is presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements.  

 The separation of former Viacom Inc. ("Former Viacom") into two publicly traded entities, CBS Corp. and new Viacom Inc. ("Viacom Inc."), was completed on December 31, 2005 (the "Separation"). The Separation was accomplished pursuant to a merger in which a subsidiary of Former Viacom was merged with and into Former Viacom, with Former Viacom continuing as the surviving entity. On December 31, 2005, Former Viacom was renamed "CBS Corporation" and each outstanding share of Former Viacom class A and class B common stock was converted into the right to receive .5 of a share of each of CBS Corp. Class A and Class B Common Stock and .5 of a share of each of Viacom Inc. class A and class B common stock. CBS Corp. has accounted for the Separation as a spin-off of Viacom Inc. and, accordingly, the results of Viacom Inc. have been presented as a discontinued operation in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005.  

CBS Corp. operates in the following segments:    

TELEVISION: The Television segment consists of CBS Television, comprised of the CBS Television Network, the Company's owned television stations, and its television production and syndication operations; Showtime Networks; and CSTV Networks (to be rebranded CBS College Sports Network in March 2008). Television revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, television license fees and affiliate revenues. Television contributed 66% to consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. 

RADIO: The Radio segment owns radio stations in most of the large U.S. markets. Radio revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales. Radio contributed 12%, 14% and 15% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 

OUTDOOR: The Outdoor segment, principally through CBS Outdoor, displays advertising on media including billboards, transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in-car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage and in retail stores. Outdoor revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales. Outdoor contributed 16%, 15% and 14% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 

PUBLISHING: The Publishing segment consists of Simon & Schuster's consumer book publishing business with imprints such as Simon & Schuster, Pocket Books, Scribner and Free Press. Publishing contributed 6% to consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, and 5% for the year ended December 31, 2005.

Revenues  

 The tables below present the Company's consolidated revenues by type for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 Advertising sales decreased 3% to $10.06 billion in 2007 from $10.37 billion in 2006 reflecting the absence of UPN and the impact of radio and television station divestitures. These items reduced the Company's advertising sales by 3% for 2007 versus 2006. Television advertising sales decreased 3% reflecting the absence of UPN, the impact of television station divestitures and lower political advertising sales, partially offset by the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI on CBS Television Network. Radio advertising sales decreased 11% in 2007 due to weakness in radio advertising sales and the impact of radio station divestitures. Outdoor advertising sales increased 4% reflecting a 13% increase in Europe and Asia partially offset by a 1% decrease in North America, reflecting a decline in U.S. transit and displays due to the non-renewal of certain marginally profitable transit and street furniture contracts in New York City and Chicago partially offset by growth in U.S. billboards. In 2006, advertising sales decreased $42.6 million to $10.37 billion from $10.42 billion in 2005 reflecting decreases at Radio and Television, partially offset by growth at Outdoor. Radio advertising sales decreased 8% reflecting weakness in the overall radio advertising market and the impact of programming changes at 27 owned radio stations during 2006. Television advertising sales decreased 1% primarily reflecting the shutdown of UPN in September 2006 and decreases at CBS Television Network, partially offset by strong political advertising sales at the television stations. Outdoor advertising sales increased 8% reflecting a 9% increase in North America, primarily in U.S. billboards, and a 5% increase in Europe and Asia.  

 Television license fees decreased 14% to $1.38 billion in 2007 from $1.61 billion in 2006 principally reflecting lower domestic syndication revenues as revenues from 2007 domestic availabilities, including

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 NCIS, did not match contributions from the 2006 basic cable availability and off-network syndication of Frasier and the 2006 basic cable availability of Star Trek: Voyager. Television license fees increased 26% to $1.61 billion in 2006 from $1.28 billion in 2005 principally reflecting higher revenues from the domestic syndication sales of CSI: Miami, Without a Trace, Frasier and  Star Trek: Voyager, and higher foreign syndication revenues, partially offset by the absence of license fees from the 2005 second-cycle cable renewal of  Everybody Loves Raymond and lower network license fees in 2006.  

 Affiliate revenues increased 4% to $1.12 billion in 2007 from $1.07 billion in 2006 driven by rate increases and subscriber growth at Showtime Networks and CSTV Networks. Affiliate revenues increased 8% to $1.07 billion in 2006 from $992.1 million in 2005, reflecting rate increases and subscriber growth at Showtime Networks and the inclusion of CSTV Networks since its acquisition in January 2006.  

 Publishing revenues increased 10% to $886.1 million in 2007 from $807.0 million in 2006 reflecting higher sales in the Adult and International groups, led by the success of the best-selling title The Secret by Rhonda Byrne. Publishing revenues increased 6% to $807.0 million in 2006 from $763.6 million in 2005 primarily driven by sales of top-selling titles in the Adult, Children's and International groups.  

 Home entertainment revenues, primarily consisting of DVD sales, increased $118.5 million to $201.9 million in 2007 from $83.4 million in 2006, as the Company is in the second year of a third party distribution arrangement which provides the Company with revenues after recoupment of upfront distribution costs incurred by the third party distributor. Home entertainment revenues decreased $176.3 million, or 68%, to $83.4 million in 2006 from $259.7 million in 2005 principally reflecting the switch from self-distribution in 2005 to third party distribution in 2006.  

 Other revenues, which include digital media revenues and other ancillary fees for Television and Radio operations, increased 12% to $424.1 million in 2007 from $380.3 million in 2006 principally reflecting higher digital media revenues. For 2006, other revenues decreased 6% to $380.3 million from $404.7 million in 2005 primarily reflecting lower revenues from the licensing and merchandising of television product and third party use of the studio facility.  

International Revenues  

 The Company generated approximately 12% of its total revenues from international regions in 2007, 11% in 2006 and 12% in 2005.   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Expenses  

 The table below presents the Company's consolidated operating expenses by type:   [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

 For 2007, operating expenses of $8.33 billion decreased 1% from $8.42 billion in 2006. For 2006, operating expenses of $8.42 billion increased 1% from $8.38 billion in 2005. The major components and changes in operating expenses were as follows:    

Programming expenses represented 41% of total operating expenses in 2007, 40% in 2006 and 41% in 2005, and reflect the amortization of acquired rights of programs exhibited on the broadcast and cable networks, and television and radio stations. Programming expenses increased 1% to $3.39 billion in 2007 from $3.35 billion in 2006 reflecting higher costs associated with the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI on CBS Television Network partially offset by lower expenses resulting from the absence of UPN. Programming expenses decreased 3% to $3.35 billion in 2006 from $3.45 billion in 2005 principally reflecting lower costs associated with primetime series on CBS Television Network, the shutdown of UPN and lower sports programming expenses at Radio. 

Production expenses represented 28% of total operating expenses in 2007, 31% in 2006 and 29% in 2005, and reflect the costs and amortization of internally developed television programs, including direct production costs, residuals and participation expenses, and production overhead, as well as television and radio costs, including on-air talent and other production costs. Production expenses decreased 10% to $2.33 billion in 2007 from $2.59 billion in 2006 primarily reflecting lower costs associated with lower syndication revenues. Production expenses increased 8% to $2.59 billion in 2006 from $2.40 billion in 2005 primarily reflecting higher costs relating to the 2006 syndication sales of Frasier and CSI: Miami. 

Outdoor operations expenses represented 14% of total operating expenses in each of the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, and reflect transit, billboard lease, maintenance, posting and rotation expenses. Outdoor operations expenses increased 1% to $1.18 billion in 2007 from $1.17 billion in 2006 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes and increased costs for maintenance and materials, partially offset by lower transit costs, principally reflecting the non-renewal of certain transit and street furniture contracts in New York City and Chicago. Outdoor operations expenses increased 3% to $1.17 billion in 2006 from $1.13 billion in 2005 principally reflecting higher transit and billboard lease costs partially offset by the absence of the impact of 2005 hurricanes. 

Publishing operations expenses, which represented 7% of total operating expenses in 2007, and 6% in both 2006 and 2005, reflect cost of book sales, royalties and other costs incurred with respect to publishing operations. Publishing operations expenses for 2007 increased 9% to $590.1 million from $539.2 million in 2006 reflecting higher production costs and royalty expenses resulting from the increase in revenues and the mix of titles. Publishing operations expenses for 2006 increased 3% to   

II-7 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of  

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)  

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)    

$539.2 million from $525.0 million in 2005 reflecting higher production, return, and freight and delivery costs partially offset by lower royalty expenses.    

Other operating expenses, which represented 10% of total operating expenses in 2007, 9% in 2006 and 10% in 2005, primarily include distribution expenses incurred with respect to television product, costs associated with digital media, and compensation. Other operating expenses increased 7% to $835.0 million in 2007 from $777.5 million in 2006 due to higher television distribution costs and higher costs associated with digital media. Other operating expenses decreased 10% to $777.5 million in 2006 from $862.1 million in 2005 primarily reflecting lower home entertainment distribution costs due to the switch from self-distribution in 2005 to third party distribution in 2006, partially offset by higher costs associated with digital media investment and expansion.   

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

 Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses, which include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy and back office support, represented 19% of revenues for each of the years 2007, 2006 and 2005. SG&A expenses decreased $118.2 million, or 4%, to $2.67 billion in 2007 from $2.78 billion in 2006, primarily reflecting lower expenses due to the sale of radio and television stations, the absence of UPN and lower pension and postretirement benefits costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of $42.3 million in stock-based compensation expense and increased costs associated with online and interactive businesses. In 2007, pension and postretirement benefits costs decreased $66.7 million from 2006 primarily due to the recognition of lower actuarial losses and the impact of $250.0 million of discretionary contributions made during 2006 to pre-fund the Company's qualified pension plans.  

 For 2006, SG&A expenses increased $104.6 million, or 4%, to $2.78 billion from $2.68 billion in 2005 primarily reflecting higher employee-related costs, including an increase of $46.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, the inclusion of CSTV Networks since its acquisition in January 2006 and $24.0 million of UPN shutdown costs, partially offset by lower expenses resulting from the absence of UPN since September 2006. In 2006, pension and postretirement benefits costs increased $39.6 million from 2005, primarily due to an increase in pension costs from the recognition of higher actuarial losses, which resulted from the change in the mortality rate assumption and lower than expected plan asset performance in 2005 partially offset by lower postretirement benefits costs reflecting the effect of a Medicare Part D subsidy. Advertising expenses of $328.1 million included in SG&A expenses in 2006 decreased 4% from 2005 primarily due to lower spending at Television, principally reflecting the shutdown of UPN.  

Impairment Charges  

 The Company recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $65.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill for certain television stations to be disposed. The Company completed the sale of these television stations on January 10, 2008 (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).  

 Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142") requires the Company to perform a fair value-based impairment test of goodwill on at least an annual basis. The first step of the test examines whether or not the book value of each of the Company's reporting units exceeds its fair value. If the book value for a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the test is then required to compare the implied fair value of that reporting unit's goodwill with the book value of its goodwill. The Company's reporting units are generally one level below or at the operating  

II-8 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

segment level. Effective as of the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company tested for goodwill impairment for the Radio operating segment at its geographic component level.  

 The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was computed principally based upon the present value of future cash flows (Discounted Cash Flow Method) and both the traded and transaction values of comparable businesses (Market Comparable Method). The Discounted Cash Flow Method and Market Comparable Method were weighted equally and resulted in substantially equal fair values.  

 As a result of the 2005 annual impairment test, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $9.48 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005. The $9.48 billion reflected charges to reduce the carrying value of goodwill at the Television segment of $6.44 billion and the Radio segment of $3.05 billion.  

Depreciation and Amortization  

 For 2007, depreciation and amortization increased $16.2 million, or 4%, to $455.7 million from $439.5 million principally reflecting higher depreciation associated with new broadcast facilities. For 2006, depreciation and amortization decreased slightly to $439.5 million from $440.1 million.  

Interest Expense  

 For 2007, interest expense increased $5.4 million to $570.9 million from $565.5 million as debt balances in 2007 remained relatively consistent with the prior year. The Company had $7.09 billion at December 31, 2007 and $7.04 billion at December 31, 2006 of principal amounts of debt outstanding (including current maturities) at weighted average interest rates of 7.1% and 7.0%, respectively. For 2006, interest expense decreased 22% to $565.5 million from $720.5 million in 2005 due to lower debt balances in 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2005, the Company received from Viacom Inc. a $5.4 billion special cash dividend as a result of the Separation, which was used by the Company to repay outstanding commercial paper, debt outstanding under a revolving credit facility and certain fixed rate debt upon maturity in January 2006. In addition, certain fixed rate debt was repaid during 2005, upon maturity.  

Interest Income  

 For 2007, interest income increased $4.0 million to $116.1 million from $112.1 million in 2006. For 2006, interest income increased to $112.1 million from $21.3 million in 2005, principally resulting from an increase in cash and cash equivalents, primarily reflecting the proceeds from the sale of Paramount Parks and cash flow from operations.  

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt  

 For 2006, "Loss on early extinguishment of debt" of $6.0 million reflected losses recognized upon the early redemption of $50.0 million of the Company's 6.625% senior notes due 2011 and $52.2 million of the Company's 7.70% senior notes due 2010.  

Other Items, Net  

 For 2007, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $34.0 million principally consisting of losses associated with securitizing trade receivables of $32.0 million and a non-cash charge of $24.8 million associated with an other-than-temporary decline in the market value of one of the Company's investments, partially offset by a net pre-tax gain of $10.0 million on television and radio station divestitures, foreign exchange gains of $8.0 million and gains of $3.9 million on the sale of investments.  

 For 2006, "Other items, net" reflected a net loss of $14.3 million principally consisting of losses associated with securitizing trade receivables of $31.0 million, a non-cash charge of $6.2 million associated  

II-9

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

with an other-than-temporary decline in the market value of one of the Company's investments and foreign exchange losses of $2.0 million, partially offset by a pre-tax gain of $24.6 million on radio station divestitures.  

 For 2005, "Other items, net" of $4.3 million principally reflected a net gain of $86.2 million from the sale of investments and businesses, and foreign exchange gains of $9.9 million, partially offset by losses associated with securitizing trade receivables of $23.8 million and a non-cash charge of $67.9 million associated with other-than-temporary declines in the market value of certain radio investments.  

Provision for Income Taxes  

 The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign income taxes on earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, equity in loss of investee companies and minority interest. The provision for income taxes for continuing operations was $821.5 million, $652.2 million and $794.2 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The annual effective income tax rate was 38.5% in 2007 versus 30.6% in 2006 reflecting the absence of 2006 tax settlements of $164.1 million and the tax impact of television and radio station divestitures. The provision for income taxes included tax provisions of $68.5 million and $33.5 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, relating to station divestitures. For 2005, the annual effective income tax rate was (10.5)% which included the impact of the pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $9.48 billion ($9.46 billion, net of tax) to reduce the carrying value of goodwill.  

 For 2008, the annual effective income tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 38.0% to 38.5%.  

Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax  

 Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax, reflects the operating results of the Company's equity investments. Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax, was $80.6 million for 2007, $97.0 million for 2006 and $1.5 million for 2005. These net losses principally reflected non-cash charges of $62.9 million, $94.2 million and $20.7 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, associated with other-than-temporary declines in the market value of the Company's investments, principally Westwood One, Inc. ("Westwood One"). The net losses in 2007 and 2006 also reflected operating losses from the Company's 50% investment in The CW.  

Minority Interest, Net of Tax  

 Minority interest primarily represents the minority ownership of certain international entities.  

Net Earnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations  

 For 2007, the Company reported net earnings from continuing operations of $1.23 billion versus net earnings from continuing operations of $1.38 billion in 2006, and a net loss from continuing operations of $8.36 billion in 2005. The loss in 2005 was driven by the non-cash impairment charge of $9.48 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill.

Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations  

 During 2006, Paramount Parks was sold to Cedar Fair, L.P. for $1.24 billion in cash and as a result, Paramount Parks has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements.  

 The Separation of Former Viacom was accounted for by the Company as a spin-off of Viacom Inc. Accordingly, the operations of Viacom Inc. are presented as a discontinued operation in the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2005.  

 For the year ended December 31, 2007, net earnings from discontinued operations of $16.2 million principally reflects adjustments to the gain on the sale of Paramount Parks.  

 The following tables set forth the details of CBS Corp.'s net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2006, net earnings from discontinued operations primarily reflected the operating results and the gain on the sale of Paramount Parks. Net earnings from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2005 included the operating results of Paramount Parks as well as Viacom Inc., prior to its separation from the Company.

Segment Results of OperationsFor the Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005  

 The tables below present the Company's revenues, segment operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization and impairment charges ("Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges"), operating income (loss), and depreciation and amortization by segment, for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(a)The Company presents Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges as the primary measure of profit and loss for its operating segments in accordance with SFAS No. 131 "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS 131"). The Company believes the presentation of Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management and enhances their ability to understand the Company's operating performance. The reconciliation of Segment OIBDA before Impairment Charges to the Company's consolidated Net Earnings (Loss) is presented in Note 15 (Reportable Segments) to the consolidated financial statements. 

(b)The Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $65.2 million in the Television segment during the fourth quarter of 2006 to reduce the carrying value of the allocated goodwill for certain television stations to be disposed. As a result of the Company's annual goodwill and intangible assets impairment tests, a non-cash charge of $9.48 billion was recorded in 2005 to reduce the carrying value of goodwill. The 2005 charge of $9.48 billion is comprised of $6.44 billion for the Television segment and $3.05 billion for the Radio segment.

NMNot meaningful  

2007 vs. 2006  

 For 2007, Television revenues decreased 2% to $9.27 billion from $9.49 billion in 2006 primarily due to lower television license fee and advertising revenues partially offset by increases in affiliate and home entertainment revenues. Revenues for 2007 were negatively impacted by the absence of UPN which ceased broadcasting in September 2006 and television station divestitures. These two items reduced total 2007 Television revenues by 3% and 2007 Television advertising revenues by 4% versus 2006. Advertising revenues decreased by 3% primarily due to the above mentioned factors and lower political advertising sales partially offset by the 2007 telecast of Super Bowl XLI on CBS Television Network. Television license fee revenues decreased 14% reflecting lower domestic syndication revenues as revenues from 2007 domestic availabilities, including  NCIS, did not match contributions from the 2006 basic cable availability and off-network syndication of  Frasier and cable availability of Star Trek: Voyager. Affiliate revenues increased 4% primarily due to subscriber growth and rate increases at Showtime Networks and CSTV Networks. Home entertainment revenues increased by $118.5 million over 2006 as the Company is in the second year of a third party distribution arrangement which provides the Company with revenues after recoupment of upfront distribution costs incurred by the third party distributor.  

 For 2007, Television reported operating income of $1.74 billion versus $1.71 billion in 2006. Included in 2006 operating income was a non-cash impairment charge of $65.2 million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill. Television OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 1% to $1.93 billion in 2007 from $1.95 billion in 2006 principally reflecting lower political advertising sales and lower profits from syndication sales partially offset by higher home entertainment revenues and the absence of $24.0 million of shutdown costs for UPN incurred in 2006. Included in total Television expenses is stock-based compensation of $49.6 million and $31.1 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of  

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)  

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 License fees for completed television programming in syndication and on cable are recorded as revenues in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such licensing agreements were $582.9 million and $675.5 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

2006 vs. 2005  

 For 2006, Television revenues increased 2% to $9.49 billion from $9.33 billion in 2005 primarily due to growth in television license fee and affiliate revenues partially offset by a decrease in home entertainment and advertising revenues. Television license fee revenues increased 26% due to the 2006 domestic syndication sales of  CSI: Miami and Without a Trace, the basic cable availability and off-network syndication of Frasier, the cable availability of Star Trek: Voyager and higher foreign syndication revenues partially offset by the absence of license fees from the 2005 second-cycle cable renewal of Everybody Loves Raymond and lower network license fees. Affiliate revenues increased 8% primarily due to rate increases and subscriber growth at Showtime Networks, and the inclusion of CSTV Networks results since its acquisition in January 2006. Advertising sales decreased 1% primarily due to the shutdown of UPN and decreases at CBS Television Network partially offset by higher political advertising sales. Home entertainment revenues decreased 68% principally due to the switch from self-distribution in 2005 to third party distribution in 2006.  

 For 2006, Television reported operating income of $1.71 billion versus an operating loss of $4.79 billion in 2005. Included in 2006 and 2005 operating income were non-cash impairment charges of $65.2 million and $6.44 billion, respectively, to reduce the carrying value of goodwill. Television OIBDA before impairment charges increased 7% to $1.95 billion in 2006 from $1.82 billion in 2005. This increase primarily reflects the increases in revenues noted above and lower costs associated with primetime series at CBS Television Network partially offset by higher production costs for the syndication sales of Frasier and CSI: Miami, $24.0 million of UPN shutdown costs and higher stock-based compensation. Included in total Television expenses is stock-based compensation of $31.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Capital expenditures increased $19.3 million to $216.5 million in 2006 from $197.2 million in 2005, principally reflecting increased spending for buildings and technical equipment.

2007 vs. 2006  

 For 2007, Radio revenues decreased 11% to $1.75 billion from $1.96 billion in 2006 reflecting weakness in advertising sales and the impact of radio station sales in ten markets. The station divestitures negatively impacted the Radio revenue comparison by 5% in 2007. Radio receives affiliation and other fees and consideration for management services provided to Westwood One, an investment of the Company. Revenues from these arrangements totaled $51.6 million in 2007 and $59.1 million in 2006. On October 2, 2007, CBS Radio and Westwood One entered into definitive agreements including, among others, agreements relating to the termination of management and representation arrangements, and modification and extension of certain arrangements involving compensation to the Company, the provision of radio programming (principally news and traffic) by Westwood One to CBS Radio and the distribution by Westwood One of CBS Radio News. The termination, modification and extension of these arrangements are subject to certain closing conditions.  

 For 2007, Radio operating income decreased 16% to $657.8 million from $787.4 million in 2006 and OIBDA decreased 16% to $688.7 million from $820.0 million in 2006. These decreases principally reflected lower advertising sales and the impact of station divestitures partially offset by lower sports programming expenses. Operating expenses, primarily comprised of radio programming and production expenses, decreased 3% in 2007 primarily due to the absence of expenses for divested stations and lower sports programming expenses partially offset by higher employee-related costs, contractual increases in music license fees and higher costs associated with digital media. SG&A expenses decreased 9% in 2007 reflecting the absence of expenses for divested stations and lower commissions and employee-related costs partially offset by higher stock-based compensation expense. Included in total Radio expenses is stock-based compensation of $15.9 million and $10.7 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.

2006 vs. 2005  

 For 2006, Radio revenues decreased 7% to $1.96 billion from $2.11 billion in 2005, principally reflecting 8% lower advertising sales from decreases in both average unit rates and units sold, resulting from weakness in the overall radio advertising market as well as the impact of programming changes at 27 owned radio stations during 2006. Revenues from arrangements with Westwood One totaled $59.1 million in 2006 and $63.4 million in 2005.  

 For 2006, Radio reported operating income of $787.4 million versus an operating loss of $2.15 billion in 2005, which included a non-cash impairment charge of $3.05 billion to reduce the carrying value of goodwill. Radio OIBDA before impairment charges decreased 11% to $820.0 million in 2006 from $925.0 million in 2005, reflecting the revenue decline noted above partially offset by lower expenses. Operating expenses decreased 5% in 2006 principally reflecting lower programming costs, including sports programming. SG&A expenses decreased 3% in 2006 primarily reflecting decreases in professional fees, sales commissions and bad debt expense partially offset by lower gains on disposition of assets in 2006 as compared to 2005. Included in total Radio expenses is stock-based compensation of $10.7 million and $2.3 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

2007 vs. 2006  

 For 2007, Outdoor revenues increased 4% to $2.19 billion from $2.10 billion in 2006 reflecting an increase of 13% in Europe and Asia, driven by favorable foreign exchange rate changes and growth in the U.K. and France markets, and growth in the U.S. billboard business. Revenues for North America decreased 1% in 2007 as growth of 9% in U.S. billboards, 9% in Canada and 8% in Mexico was more than offset by a decline of 28% in U.S. transit and displays, reflecting the non-renewal of marginally profitable transit and street furniture contracts in New York City and Chicago. The non-renewal of these contracts negatively impacted the Outdoor revenue comparison by 6% in 2007. The favorable net impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on total Outdoor revenues was approximately $75 million in 2007. Approximately 48% and 44% of Outdoor revenues were generated from international regions in 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

 For 2007, Outdoor operating income increased 15% to $404.9 million from $351.8 million in 2006 and OIBDA increased 9% to $620.9 million from $568.0 million in 2006, led by growth in North America. North America operating income and OIBDA increased 23% to $336.5 million and 13% to $518.4 million, respectively, due to strength in the U.S. billboard business. Europe and Asia operating income and OIBDA decreased 13% to $68.4 million and 5% to $102.5 million, respectively, reflecting higher transit costs, principally in the U.K., partially offset by the revenue growth and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Total Outdoor operating expenses increased 1% in 2007 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes on expenses and increased costs for maintenance and materials, partially offset by lower transit costs. The decrease in transit costs reflected lower costs in the U.S. due to the previously mentioned non-renewal of certain contracts partially offset by increases in the U.K. SG&A expenses increased 6% in 2007 reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes on expenses and higher bad debt expense and professional fees. Included in total Outdoor expenses is stock-based compensation of $5.3 million and $3.2 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

 Capital expenditures increased $70.7 million to $186.4 million in 2007 principally reflecting increased spending for transit contracts in the U.K.  

2006 vs. 2005  

 For 2006, Outdoor revenues increased 8% to $2.10 billion in 2006 from $1.95 billion in 2005 led by growth of 9% in North America and 5% in Europe and Asia. North America results reflected growth of 11% in U.S. billboards, 8% in Canada and 14% in Mexico. Results in Europe and Asia were principally driven by growth in the U.K., Italy and China markets. The favorable net impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on Outdoor revenues was approximately $18 million in 2006. Approximately 44% and 45% of Outdoor revenues were generated from international regions in 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

 Outdoor operating income increased 35% to $351.8 million in 2006 from $260.5 million in 2005, and OIBDA increased 21% to $568.0 million in 2006 from $469.9 million in 2005, reflecting the revenue increase noted above partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased 3% in 2006 primarily due to higher transit and billboard lease costs and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes, partially offset by the absence of the impact of 2005 hurricanes. SG&A expenses increased 6% in 2006 due to higher employee-related expenses and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes offset in part by lower professional fees and bad debt expense. Included in total Outdoor expenses is stock-based compensation of $3.2 million and $.6 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

2007 vs. 2006  

 For 2007, Publishing revenues increased 10% to $886.1 million from $807.0 million in 2006 primarily reflecting higher sales in the Adult and International groups, led by the performance of the best-seller The Secret by Rhonda Byrne. Additional best-selling titles in 2007 included YOU: Staying Young by Michael F. Roizen and Mehmet C. Oz and Become A Better You by Joel Osteen.  

 For 2007, Publishing operating income increased 29% to $88.1 million from $68.5 million in 2006 and OIBDA increased 25% to $97.2 million from $78.0 million in 2006. These increases reflected the revenue growth noted above partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased 9% in 2007 due to higher production costs and royalty expenses resulting from the revenue increase and the mix of titles. SG&A expenses increased 5% in 2007 reflecting increased employee-related costs, digital archive costs, and higher volume-driven advertising and selling expenses partially offset by lower bad debt expense. Included in total Publishing expenses is stock-based compensation of $3.5 million and $1.9 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively.  

2006 vs. 2005  

 For 2006, Publishing revenues increased 6% to $807.0 million from $763.6 million in 2005 led by higher book sales, primarily in the Adult and International groups, as well as higher distribution fee income.

expenses increased 16% in 2006 primarily resulting from an increase in bad debt expense and higher selling and marketing, and employee-related costs. Included in total Publishing expenses is stock-based compensation of $1.9 million and $.5 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

Financial Position  

 Current assets decreased by $2.11 billion to $6.03 billion at December 31, 2007 from $8.14 billion at December 31, 2006 primarily due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents of $1.73 billion and receivables of $146.0 million. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents principally reflected the purchase of Company common stock for $3.35 billion and dividend payments, partially offset by cash flow from operations. The decrease in receivables is primarily due to a decrease in syndication revenues as well as radio and television station divestitures. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of receivables was 5.0% at December 31, 2007 compared with 5.1% at December 31, 2006.  

 Net property and equipment increased by $107.7 million to $2.92 billion at December 31, 2007 from $2.81 billion at December 31, 2006 reflecting capital expenditures of $469.1 million partially offset by depreciation expense of $359.5 million. Goodwill of $18.45 billion at December 31, 2007 decreased $369.5 million from $18.82 billion at December 31, 2006, primarily reflecting television and radio station divestitures and certain tax-related purchase accounting adjustments, partially offset by acquisitions and foreign currency translation adjustments. Intangible assets, principally consisting of FCC licenses, and leasehold and franchise agreements, decreased by $343.7 million to $10.08 billion at December 31, 2007 from $10.43 billion at December 31, 2006, primarily due to television and radio station divestitures of $275.5 million and amortization expense of $96.2 million.  

 Pension and postretirement benefit obligations decreased by $297.4 million to $1.70 billion at December 31, 2007 from $1.99 billion at December 31, 2006 primarily due to a $150.0 million discretionary contribution in 2007 to pre-fund the Company's qualified pension plans and actuarial gains in 2007. Noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities, net decreased by $363.5 million to $1.95 billion at December 31, 2007 from $2.31 billion at December 31, 2006, primarily due to purchase accounting adjustments.

 Operating Activities. In 2007, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $177.9 million, or 9%, to $2.18 billion from $2.00 billion in 2006 principally reflecting a $150.0 million discretionary contribution made during 2007 to pre-fund the Company's qualified pension plans versus contributions of $250.0 million in 2006, lower cash taxes paid and lower net cash interest. In 2006, cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $180.2 million, or 10%, to $2.00 billion from $1.82 billion in 2005 principally reflecting higher earnings after adjusting for non-cash items, including the impairment charges and stock-based compensation. These increases were partially offset by higher taxes paid in 2006 and lower cash inflows from net changes in operating assets and liabilities, principally reflecting $250.0 million of discretionary contributions made during 2006 to pre-fund the Company's qualified pension plans.  

 Cash paid for income taxes from continuing operations was $524.9 million for 2007, $562.2 million for 2006 and $493.4 million for 2005. Cash taxes for 2008 are anticipated to be in the range of $550 million to $600 million.

Capital expenditures increased $75.0 million, or 19%, to $469.1 million in 2007 from $394.1 million in 2006 principally reflecting increased spending for Outdoor transit contracts in the U.K. Capital expenditures increased $67.1 million, or 21%, to $394.1 million in 2006 from $327.0 million in 2005 principally reflecting spending for outdoor advertising structures, buildings and technical equipment. In 2005, cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations of $4.98 billion reflected the $5.4 billion special dividend received from Viacom Inc. as well as proceeds from dispositions of $279.6 million, principally reflecting the sale of television and radio stations. These proceeds were partially offset by capital expenditures of $327.0 million and acquisitions of $462.9 million, primarily reflecting the acquisitions of KOVR-TV and KIFR-FM.  

 For 2007, capital expenditures were $469.1 million, which includes spending for Outdoor of $186.4 million. For 2008, capital expenditures for the Company are anticipated to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million, principally reflecting increases for high-definition television upgrades and other information technology spending. Capital expenditures for Outdoor in 2008 are currently expected to be comparable to 2007; however, spending could vary based on successful bids for new Outdoor contracts.  

 Financing Activities. In 2007, cash flow used for financing activities of $3.78 billion principally reflected the purchase of Company common stock for $3.35 billion, the repayment of notes of $660.0 million and dividend payments of $640.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of notes of $678.0 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $201.7 million.

 For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the following debt repurchases and maturities occurred:  

Debt Repurchases  

 During 2006, the Company repurchased $50.0 million of its 6.625% senior notes due 2011 and $52.2 million of its 7.70% senior notes due 2010, resulting in a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.0 million.  

Debt Maturities   

May 1, 2007, 5.625% senior notes, $700.0 million

 January 30, 2006, 6.40% senior notes, $800.0 million   

 At December 31, 2007, the Company's scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, including discontinued operations debt and excluding capital leases were as follows:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]  

Credit Facility  

 As of December 31, 2007, the Company had a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility due December 2010 (the "Credit Facility"). The Company, at its option, may also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the facility are determined at the Company's option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the United States or the London Interbank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") plus a margin based on the Company's senior unsecured debt rating. The Company pays a facility fee based on the total amount of the commitments. As of December 31, 2007, the remaining availability under this Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $2.81 billion.  

 The Credit Facility contains covenants, which, among other things, require that the Company maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. At December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.  

 The primary purpose of the Credit Facility is to support commercial paper borrowings. At December 31, 2007, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings under its $3.0 billion commercial paper program.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Program  

 As of December 31, 2007, the Company had $550.0 million outstanding under its revolving receivable securitization program. The program results in the sale of receivables on a non-recourse basis to unrelated third parties on a one-year renewable basis, thereby reducing accounts receivable on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company entered into this arrangement because it provides an additional source of liquidity. Proceeds from this program were used to reduce outstanding borrowings. The terms of the revolving securitization arrangement require that the receivable pools subject to the program meet certain performance ratios. As of December 31, 2007, the Company was in compliance with the required ratios under the receivable securitization program. At December 31, 2006, the Company had $550.0 million outstanding under its revolving receivable securitization programs.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 The Company believes that its operating cash flows from continuing operations ($2.18 billion in 2007), cash and cash equivalents ($1.35 billion at December 31, 2007), borrowing capacity under its committed bank facility (which consisted of an unused revolving Credit Facility of $2.81 billion at December 31, 2007), and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund its operating needs, including commitments and contingencies, capital and investing commitments, dividends and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future. The funding for commitments to purchase sports programming rights, television and film programming, and talent contracts will come primarily from cash flow from operations.  

 The Company continually projects anticipated cash requirements, which include capital expenditures, dividends, acquisitions and principal payments on its outstanding indebtedness, as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Any additional net cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings (primarily commercial paper) and long-term debt. Commercial paper borrowings, which also accommodate day-to-day changes in funding requirements, are backed by the Credit Facility that may be utilized in the event that commercial paper borrowings are not available. The Company's credit position affords sufficient access to the capital markets to meet the Company's financial requirements.  

 The Company anticipates that future debt maturities will be funded with cash and cash equivalents, and cash flows generated from operating activities and other debt financing. There are no provisions in any of the Company's material financing agreements that would cause an acceleration of the obligation in the event of a downgrade in the Company's debt ratings.  

 The Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering debt securities, preferred stock and warrants of CBS Corp. that may be issued for aggregate gross proceeds of $5.0 billion. The registration statement was first declared effective on January 8, 2001. The net proceeds from the sale of the offered securities may be used by CBS Corp. for general corporate purposes, including repayment of borrowings, working capital and capital expenditures, or for such other purposes as may be specified in the applicable prospectus supplement. To date, the Company has issued $3.085 billion of securities under the shelf registration statement.

Contractual Obligations  

 As of December 31, 2007, the Company's significant contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows:   

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]   

(1)Programming and talent commitments of the Company primarily include $7.47 billion for sports programming rights, $2.47 billion relating to television, radio, and film production and licensing and $973.2 million for talent contracts. 

(2)Outdoor has franchise rights entitling it to display advertising on media including billboards, transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in-car, station platforms and terminals), mall kiosks, stadium signage and in retail stores. Under most of these franchise agreements, the franchisor is entitled to receive the greater of a percentage of the relevant advertising revenues, net of advertising agency fees, or a specified guaranteed minimum annual payment. 

(3)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders. 

(4)Consists of long-term operating lease commitments for office space, billboards, equipment, transponders and studio facilities, including approximately $1.26 billion of billboard lease commitments that are cancelable, in certain circumstances, at the Company's option. 

(5)Long-term contractual obligations including program liabilities, participations due to producers and residuals. 

(6)Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, including discontinued operations debt. 

(7)Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities, excluding capital leases. 

(8)Includes capital leases for satellite transponders.  

 The table above excludes $328.9 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions and the related accrued interest and penalties under FIN 48, as the Company cannot reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of cash payments relating to the settlement of these reserves.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 Prior to the Separation of Former Viacom into CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc., Former Viacom had entered into guarantees with respect to obligations related to Blockbuster Inc. ("Blockbuster"), including certain Blockbuster store leases; Famous Players theater leases; certain UCI theater leases; and certain theater leases related to W.F. Cinema Holdings L.P. and Grauman's Theatres LLC. In connection with the Separation, Viacom Inc. has agreed to indemnify the Company with respect to these guarantees. In addition, the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to indemnify each other with respect to certain other matters pursuant to the Separation Agreement between the parties.  

 The Company has indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2007, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $402.8 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  

II-26 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of  

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)  

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 In the course of its business, the Company both provides and receives indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, the Company may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. The Company records a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable under generally accepted accounting principles.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

 Financial Reporting Release No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies" ("FRR 60"), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Company's financial condition and results of operations, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. For a summary of the Company's significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.  

 The preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions. The following accounting policies require significant management judgments and estimates.    

The Company accounts for the production and distribution of television programming in accordance with Statement of Position 00-2 "Accounting by Producers or Distributors of Films" ("SOP 00-2"). SOP 00-2 requires management's judgment as it relates to the timing of the establishment of a secondary market for its television programming, and total estimated revenues to be earned and costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized television programming, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary net realizable value adjustments to capitalized television programming costs. For each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance of the television programming in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell additional episodes of the program, and the past performance of similar television programs. These estimates are updated regularly based on information available as the television program progresses through its life cycle. Overestimating secondary market revenues or a failure to adjust for a downward change in the total estimated revenue could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized television programming costs, future net realizable value adjustments and impact the determination of participation expense. 

The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. The total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets, based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management's judgment and often involves the use   

II-27 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of  

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)  

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)    

of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives, and market multiples, among other items.    

In accordance with SFAS 142, the Company tests goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year, and on an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. A significant downward revision in the present value of estimated future cash flows for a reporting unit or intangible assets could result in an impairment under SFAS 142, and a non-cash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on reported net earnings. 

Balance sheet reserves and liabilities related to legal issues, restructuring charges and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments and estimates by management. The Company continually evaluates these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While management believes that the current reserves for matters related to predecessor operations of the Company, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. 

Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate reflects the rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled. The Company determined the discount rate by projecting the plans expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation. Those projected benefit payments are used to construct a high quality bond portfolio with interest and principal payments that provide the cash flows necessary to meet the projected benefit payments. The projected benefit payments are discounted by the weighted average yield of the bond portfolio. The expected return on plan assets assumption was derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. For 2007, the unrecognized actuarial losses decreased primarily due to an increase in the discount rate partially offset by lower than expected return from plan assets. For 2006, the unrecognized actuarial losses decreased primarily due to an increase in the discount rate as well as higher than expected return from plan assets. A decrease in the discount rate or a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the discount rate would be a change of approximately $5 million on 2008 pension expense and will change the projected benefit obligation by approximately $110 million. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $10 million in 2008 pension expense. 

The Company is subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. When recording the worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters, for which a reserve has been established, is audited and finally resolved. During 2007 and 2006, the Company recognized tax benefits of $8.0 million and $164.1 million, respectively, related to the settlement of certain prior year tax audits. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"), the Company evaluates a tax position to

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)    

determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. The Company is continually audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, the Company believes that its reserve for uncertain tax positions of $278.8 million at December 31, 2007 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 48.    

In accordance with SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), the Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. For each award of employee stock options the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model requires management to make significant judgments and estimates. The use of different assumptions and estimates in the Black-Scholes option pricing model could have a material impact on the estimated fair value of option grants and the related expense. The risk free interest rate is based on a U.S. Treasury rate in effect on the date of grant with a term equal to the expected life. The expected term was determined based on historical employee exercise and post-vesting termination behavior. The expected dividend yield is based on the then current annual dividend rate. When calculating expected stock price volatility, the Company placed exclusive reliance on implied volatility due to the limited amount of trading history for CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock. In addition, given the existence of an actively traded market for CBS Corp. options, the Company was able to derive implied volatility using publicly traded options to purchase CBS Corp. Class B Common Stock that were trading near the grant date of the employee stock options at a similar exercise price and a remaining term of greater than one year. Although there is an active market for these publicly traded CBS Corp. options, the Company believes that due to their short trading history, the volatility of these options alone may not be indicative of expected volatility. As a result, the expected stock price volatility was determined using an average of the implied volatility of these options and the implied volatility of publicly traded options for entities with similar business characteristics within the Company's industry.   

Legal Matters  

 Shareholder Derivative Lawsuits. Two shareholder derivative lawsuits, consolidated as In re Viacom Inc. Shareholders Derivative Litigation, were filed in July 2005 in New York State Supreme Court relating to executive compensation and alleged corporate waste. The actions named each member of Former Viacom's Board of Directors at the time the actions were filed, the two former Co-Presidents and Co-Chief Operating Officers of Former Viacom, and, as a nominal defendant, Former Viacom, alleging that the 2004 compensation of such officers and the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Former Viacom was improper. In January 2007, a new shareholder derivative action was filed in New York Supreme Court, which contained allegations similar to those in the earlier actions, and was consolidated with  In re Viacom Inc. Shareholders Derivative Litigation. In April 2007, following notice to shareholders, the parties executed a Stipulation of Settlement, which resolved all of these actions. By order and final judgment entered December 3, 2007, the court approved the Stipulation of Settlement and dismissed the action with prejudice. The Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to equally share all costs and expenses relating to this matter.  

II-29

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

 Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos, Environmental and Other. The Company is a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred principally as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. The Company is typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of the Company's products is the basis of a claim. Claims against the Company in which a product has been identified principally relate to exposures allegedly caused by asbestos-containing insulating material in turbines sold for power-generation, industrial and marine use, or by asbestos containing grades of decorative micarta, a laminate used in commercial ships.  

 Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in large groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. The Company does not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets which some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2007, the Company had pending approximately 72,120 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 73,310 as of December 31, 2006 and approximately 101,170 as of December 31, 2005. Of the claims pending as of December 31, 2007, approximately 40,520 were pending in state courts, 28,100 in federal courts and, additionally, approximately 3,500 were third party claims pending in state courts. During 2007, the Company received approximately 4,590 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 5,780 claims. The Company reports claims as closed when it becomes aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when the Company has reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claim, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. The Company's total costs for the years 2007 and 2006 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax benefits were approximately $17.5 million and $5.7 million, respectively. The Company's costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year as insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.  

 Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased primarily by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. Claims identified as cancer remain a small percentage of asbestos claims pending at December 31, 2007. In a substantial number of the pending claims, the plaintiff has not yet identified the claimed injury. The Company believes that its reserves and insurance are adequate to cover its asbestos liabilities.  

 The Company from time to time receives claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that it is or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to historical and predecessor operations of the Company. In addition, the Company from time to time receives personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from historical operations of the Company and its predecessors.  

 Indecency Regulation. In March 2006, the FCC released certain decisions relating to indecency complaints against certain of the Company's owned television stations and affiliated stations. The FCC ordered the Company to pay a forfeiture of $550,000 in the proceeding relating to the broadcast of a Super Bowl half-time show by the Company's television stations. In May 2006, the FCC denied the Company's petition for reconsideration. In July 2006, the Company filed a Petition for Review of the forfeiture with  

II-30 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of  

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)  

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and paid the $550,000 forfeiture in order to facilitate the Company's ability to bring the appeal. Oral argument was heard in September 2007. The Company is awaiting the court's decision.  

 In March 2006, the FCC also notified the Company and certain affiliates of the CBS Television Network of apparent liability for forfeitures relating to a broadcast of the program  Without a Trace. The FCC proposed to assess a forfeiture of $32,500 against each of these stations, totaling $260,000 for the Company's owned stations. The Company is contesting the FCC decision and the proposed forfeitures.  

 In June 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the FCC's November 2006 finding that the broadcast of fleeting and isolated expletives on another broadcast network was indecent and remanded the case to the FCC. In November 2007, the FCC sought review of the court's decision with the U.S. Supreme Court, which petition for review is pending. On February 1, 2008, the Company and others filed oppositions to the FCC's petition.  

 Additionally, the Company, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on the Company's broadcasting stations included indecent material.  

 General. On an ongoing basis, the Company defends itself in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and responds to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state and local authorities (collectively, "litigation"). Litigation is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on its understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Company believes that the above-described legal matters and other litigation to which it is a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under the Separation Agreement between the Company and Viacom Inc., the Company and Viacom Inc. have agreed to defend and indemnify the other in certain litigation in which the Company and/or Viacom Inc. is named.  

Market Risk  

 The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to modify its exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In accordance with its policy, the Company does not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, the Company does not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.   

 Foreign Exchange Risk   

 The Company conducts business with companies in various countries outside the United States, resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows and foreign currency balances in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, the Mexican Peso and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward and option contracts are used. Additionally, the Company designates forward contracts used to hedge projected future production costs as cash flow hedges, and may designate certain forward contracts as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in current period results as part of "Other items, net." The Company manages the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally. At December 31, 2007, the notional amount of all foreign exchange contracts was $100.3 million, which represents hedges of underlying foreign currency balances and expected foreign currency cash flows. At  

II-31 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of  

 Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)  

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

December 31, 2006, the notional amount of all foreign exchange contracts was $225.9 million, of which $16.8 million related to the hedging of future production costs. The remaining $209.1 million represented hedges of underlying foreign currency balances and expected foreign currency cash flows.   

 Interest Rate Risk   

 All of the Company's long-term debt has been issued under fixed interest rate agreements. The Company has entered into fixed-to-floating rate swap agreements for a portion of this debt, which are designated as fair value hedges. These swaps expose the Company to movements in short-term interest rates. Based on the amount of fixed-to-floating rate swaps and a receivable securitization program outstanding at December 31, 2007, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would cause a $15.5 million change to pre-tax earnings. As of December 31, 2007, if all parties were to agree, the swaps could have been terminated by a net payment from the Company of approximately $5.0 million including accrued interest. At both December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company was a party to $1.0 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps, which are accounted for as fair value hedges. The Company did not have any interest rate cash flow hedges outstanding at December 31, 2007 and 2006.   

 Credit Risk   

 The Company continually monitors its positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments. The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.  

 The Company's receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2007 or 2006, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which the Company's products and services are sold.  

Related Parties  

 National Amusements, Inc. National Amusements, Inc. ("NAI") is the controlling stockholder of CBS Corp. Mr. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling stockholder, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of NAI, is the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and founder of both CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. At December 31, 2007, NAI beneficially owned CBS Corp. Class A Common Stock representing approximately 79% of the voting power of all classes of CBS Corp.'s Common Stock, and owned approximately 13% of CBS Corp.'s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock on a combined basis.  

 On October 28, 2004, Former Viacom entered into an agreement (the "NAIRI Agreement") with NAI and NAIRI, Inc. ("NAIRI"), a wholly owned subsidiary of NAI, pursuant to which Former Viacom agreed to buy, and NAI and NAIRI agreed to sell, a number of shares of Class B Common Stock each month such that the ownership percentage of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock (considered as a single class) held by NAI and/or NAIRI would not increase as a result of purchases of its shares by Former Viacom under its $8.0 billion stock purchase program announced in October 2004. Pursuant to this agreement, Former Viacom purchased 9.2 million shares of Former Viacom class B common stock from NAIRI for $628.9 million in 2005. The Company did not make any purchases under this stock purchase program during 2007 and 2006.  

 Viacom Inc. For purposes of governing certain ongoing relationships between CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. after the Separation, the Company and Viacom Inc. entered into various agreements  

II-32 

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

 (Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  

including a separation agreement (the "Separation Agreement"), tax matters agreement and transition services agreement.  

 In accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement, Viacom Inc. paid to the Company an estimated special dividend of $5.4 billion in December 2005, subject to adjustment. During 2006, Viacom Inc. paid to the Company the net undisputed adjustment to the special dividend of $172 million plus net interest of $3.1 million. In January 2007, CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. resolved the remaining disputed items with respect to the special dividend and Viacom Inc. paid to the Company an additional $170 million, resulting in an aggregate adjustment to the special dividend of $342 million.  

 During July 2007, the Company purchased 869,145 shares of CBS Corp. Class A and Class B Common Stock from the Viacom Inc. 401(k) Plan for $29.8 million and Viacom Inc. purchased 2,823,178 shares of Viacom Inc. class A and class B common stock from the 401(k) plans sponsored by the Company for $120.0 million.  

 CBS Corp., through its normal course of business, is involved in transactions with companies owned by or affiliated with Viacom Inc. CBS Corp., through its Television segment, licenses its television products to Viacom Inc., primarily MTV Networks and BET. In addition, CBS Corp. recognizes advertising revenues for media spending placed by various subsidiaries of Viacom Inc., primarily Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures also distributes certain of the Company's television products in the home entertainment market. CBS Corp.'s total revenues from these transactions were $292.0 million, $222.8 million and $173.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

 CBS Corp., through Showtime Networks and CBS Television, pays license fees to Viacom Inc., primarily Paramount Pictures, for motion picture programming.

The Management Agreement and Representation Agreement expire on March 31, 2009. Certain of the Company's radio stations and Westwood One have affiliation agreements pursuant to which such radio stations air programs and/or commercials supplied by Westwood One and, in return, the stations receive affiliation fees and certain programming cost reimbursements. All such agreements are collectively referred to as the "Existing Agreements". CBS Television also has arrangements with Westwood One to provide news and sports programming to Westwood One. Revenues from the Existing Agreements and these arrangements were $71.6 million, $75.6 million and $81.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.  

 On October 2, 2007, CBS Radio and Westwood One entered into definitive agreements relating to the termination, modification and extension of the Existing Agreements (the "new agreements"). Certain of the new agreements, including the Technical Services Agreement, the News Programming Agreement, the Trademark License Agreement and the affiliation agreements, are extended for a term expiring March 31, 2017. Generally, the new agreements will have no force or effect unless and until closing takes place pursuant to the terms of the new agreements. The closing of the new agreements is subject to certain closing conditions. The arrangements contemplated by the new agreements include, among other things, termination of the Representation Agreement and Management Agreement, which includes relinquishment of any representation on the Westwood One board of directors and termination of the Company's outstanding warrants to acquire shares of Westwood One common stock, which are currently out-of-the-money.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards  

 Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48, which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In addition, FIN 48 provides guidance on derecognition of income tax positions, classification of income tax liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, accounting for uncertain tax positions in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. The adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  

Recent Pronouncements  

 In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"), effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and interim periods within those fiscal years. SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurement. The adoption of SFAS 157 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The provisions of SFAS 157 will be applied prospectively to fair value measurements and disclosures beginning in the first quarter of 2008.

The adoption of this standard is not expected to have an effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures goodwill, identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. SFAS 141R also expands disclosure requirements for business combinations.  

 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160 "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statementsan amendment of ARB No. 51" ("SFAS 160") effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2008. SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. The adoption of SFAS 160 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
