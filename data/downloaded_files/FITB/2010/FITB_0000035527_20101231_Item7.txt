MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

OVERVIEW  

Fifth Third Bancorp is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. At December 31, 2010, the Bancorp had $111 billion in assets and operated 15 affiliates with 1,312 full-service Banking Centers including 103 Bank Mart® locations open seven days a week inside select grocery stores and 2,445 Jeanie® ATMs in 12 states throughout the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States. The Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Investment Advisors. The Bancorp also has a 49% interest in Fifth Third Processing Solutions, LLC.  

This overview of MD&A highlights selected information in the financial results of the Bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of trends, events, commitments, uncertainties, liquidity, capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates, you should carefully read this entire document. Each of these items could have an impact on the Bancorps financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  

The Bancorp believes that banking is first and foremost a relationship business where the strength of the competition and challenges for growth can vary in every market. The Bancorp believes its affiliate operating model provides a competitive advantage by emphasizing individual relationships. Through its affiliate operating model, individual managers at all levels within the affiliates are given the opportunity to tailor financial solutions for their customers.  

The Bancorps revenues are dependent on both net interest income and noninterest income. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net interest income, on an FTE basis, and noninterest income provided 58% and 42% of total revenue, respectively. Changes in interest rates, credit quality, economic trends and the capital markets are primary factors that drive the performance of the Bancorp. As discussed later in the Risk Management section, risk identification, measurement, monitoring, control and reporting are important to the management of risk and to the financial performance and capital strength of the Bancorp.  

 Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on assets such as loans, leases and securities, and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates, the relative level of short-term and long-term interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, the rates of interest the Bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time. The change in market interest rates over time exposes the Bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position. The Bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates, the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks. The Bancorp is also exposed to the risk of losses on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by loan defaults and inadequate collateral due to a weakened economy within the Bancorps footprint.  

 Net interest income, net interest margin and the efficiency ratio are presented in MD&A on an FTE basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and securities held by the Bancorp that are not taxable for federal income tax purposes. The Bancorp believes this 

 presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.  

Noninterest income is derived primarily from mortgage banking net revenue, service charges on deposits, corporate banking revenue, fiduciary and investment management fees and card and processing revenue. Noninterest expense is primarily driven by personnel costs and occupancy expenses, costs incurred in the origination of loans and leases, and insurance expenses paid to the FDIC.  

On June 30, 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale (hereinafter the Processing Business Sale) of a majority interest in its merchant acquiring and financial institutions processing business. As a result of the sale, the Bancorp recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $1.8 billion. Under the terms of the sale, Advent International acquired an approximate 51% interest in the business. The Bancorp accounts for the retained noncontrolling interest in the business under the equity method of accounting.  

Common Stock and Senior Notes Offerings  

On January 25, 2011, the Bancorp raised $1.7 billion in new common equity through the issuance of 121,428,572 shares of common stock in an underwriting offering at an initial price of $14.00 per share. On January 24, 2011, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 12,142,857 shares at the offering price of $14.00 per share. In connection with this exercise, the Bancorp entered into a forward sale agreement which resulted in a final net payment of 959,821 shares on February 4, 2011.  

On January 25, 2011, the Bancorp issued $1.0 billion of senior notes to third party investors, and entered into a Supplemental Indenture dated January 25, 2011 with Wilmington Trust Company, as Trustee, which modifies the existing Indenture for Senior Debt Securities dated April 30, 2008 between the Bancorp and the Trustee. The Supplemental Indenture and the Indenture define the rights of the Senior Notes, which Senior Notes are represented by Global Securities dated as of January 25, 2011. The senior notes bear a fixed rate of interest of 3.625% per annum. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations of the Bancorp. Payment of the full principal amount of the notes will be due upon maturity on January 25, 2016. The notes will not be subject to the redemption at the Bancorps option at any time prior to maturity.  

Repurchase of Outstanding TARP Preferred Stock  

As further discussed in Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2008, the Bancorp issued $3.4 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series F, and related warrants to the U.S. Treasury under the U.S. Treasurys CPP.  

On February 2, 2011, the Bancorp redeemed all 136,320 shares of its Series F Preferred Stock held by the U.S. Treasury. As discussed above, the net proceeds from the Bancorps January 2011 common stock and senior notes offerings and other funds were used to redeem the $3.4 billion of Series F Preferred Stock.  

 In connection with the redemption of the Series F preferred Stock, the Bancorp accelerated the accretion of the remaining issuance discount on the Series F Preferred Stock and recorded a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of $153 million. This resulted in a one-time, noncash reduction in net income available to common shareholders and related basic and diluted earnings per share. This transaction will be reflected in the Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2011.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Dividends of $15 million were paid on February 2, 2011 when the Series F Preferred Stock was redeemed. The Bancorp paid total dividends of $356 million to the U.S. Treasury while the Series F Preferred Stock was outstanding. The Bancorp notified the U.S. Treasury on February 17, 2011, of its intention to negotiate for the purchase of the warrants issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with the CPP preferred stock investment.  

Recent Legislative Developments  

On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. This act significantly changes the financial services industry and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The legislation establishes a Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, changes the base for deposit insurance assessments, gives the Federal Reserve the ability to regulate and limit interchange rates charged to merchants for the use of debit cards, and excludes certain instruments currently included in determining Tier I regulatory capital. This act calls for federal regulatory agencies to adopt hundreds of new rules and conduct multiple studies over the next several years in order to implement its provisions. While the total impact of this legislation on Fifth Third is not currently known, the impact is expected to be substantial and may have an adverse impact on Fifth Thirds financial performance and growth opportunities.  

Earnings Summary  

The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders for 2010 was $503 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, which was net of $250 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorps net income available to common shareholders was $511 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, for 2009, which was net of $226 million in preferred stock dividends. The Bancorps results for both years reflect a number of significant items.  

Such items affecting 2010 include:  

       $152 million of noninterest income from the settlement of litigation associated with one of the Bancorps BOLI policies and $25 million of noninterest expense from related legal fees;  

       $110 million of noninterest expense from charges to representation and warranty reserves related to residential mortgage loans sold to third-parties; and  

       $68 million of net interest income due to the accretion of purchase accounting adjustments related to loans and deposits from acquisitions during 2008.  

For comparison purposes, such items affecting 2009 include:  

       $1.8 billion of noninterest income from the Processing Business Sale to Advent International;  

       $244 million of noninterest income from the sale of the Bancorps Visa, Inc. Class B common shares and a $73 million reduction to noninterest expense from the release of Visa litigation reserves;  

       $136 million of net interest income due to the accretion of purchase accounting adjustments related to loans and deposits from acquisitions during 2008;  

       $106 million income tax benefit from the decision to surrender one of the Bancorps BOLI policies and the determination that previously recorded losses on the policy are tax deductible;  

       $31 million of noninterest expense from charges to representation and warranty reserves related to residential mortgage loans sold to third-parties; 

       $55 million of noninterest expense from a special assessment by the FDIC;  

       $55 million income tax benefit from an agreement with the IRS to settle all of the Bancorps disputed leverage leases for all open years;  

       $53 million in charges to other noninterest income reflecting reserves recorded in connection with the intent to surrender one of the Bancorps BOLI policies as well as losses related to market value declines; and  

       $35 million increase to net income available to common shareholders from the exchange of 63% of outstanding Series G preferred shares for approximately 60 million common shares and $230 million in cash.  

Net interest income increased to $3.6 billion, from $3.4 billion in 2009. The primary reason for the seven percent increase in net interest income was a 39 bp increase in the net interest rate spread due to the runoff of higher priced term deposits in 2010 and the benefit of lower rates offered on new term deposits, as well as improved pricing on commercial loans. These benefits were partially offset by a decrease in the accretion of purchase accounting adjustments related to the 2008 acquisition of First Charter, which were $68 million in 2010, compared to $136 million in 2009. Net interest margin was 3.66% in 2010, an increase of 34 bp from 2009.  

Noninterest income decreased 43% to $2.7 billion in 2010 compared to $4.8 billion in 2009, driven primarily by the Processing Business Sale in the second quarter of 2009, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1.8 billion, as well as a $244 million gain related to the sale of the Bancorps Visa, Inc. Class B shares in 2009. Mortgage banking net revenue increased $94 million as a result of strong net servicing revenue and higher margins on sold loans, partially offset by a decline in mortgage originations. Card and processing revenue decreased 49% due to the Processing Business Sale in the second quarter of 2009. Service charges on deposits decreased $58 million primarily due to the impact of new overdraft regulation and policies which resulted in a decrease in overdraft occurrences. Investment advisory revenue increased $35 million as the result of improved market performance and sales production that drove an increase in brokerage activity and assets under care. Corporate banking revenue decreased two percent largely due to decreases in international income and lease remarketing fees, partially offset by growth in syndication and business lending fees.  

 Noninterest expense increased $29 million, or one percent, compared to 2009. Noninterest expense in 2010 included $25 million in legal fees associated with the settlement of claims with the insurance carrier on one of the Bancorps BOLI policies while noninterest expense in 2009 included a $73 million reduction in the Visa litigation reserve as well as a $55 million FDIC special assessment charge. Total personnel costs increased $94 million, or six percent in 2010 compared to 2009, due primarily to investments in the sales force in 2010. In addition, charges to representation and warranty reserves related to residential mortgage loans sold to third-parties totaled $110 million in 2010, compared to $31 million in 2009 due to a higher volume of repurchase demands. Partially offsetting these negative impacts was a $123 million decrease in the provision for unfunded commitments and letters of credit due to lower estimates of inherent losses as the result of a decrease in delinquent loans driven by moderation in economic conditions during 2010. In addition, card and processing expense decreased $85 million compared to 2009 due to the Processing Business Sale in June of 2009. Noninterest expense in 2010 and 2009 included $242 million and $269 million, respectively, of FDIC insurance and other taxes.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The Bancorp does not originate subprime mortgage loans, does not hold credit default swaps and does not hold asset-backed securities backed by subprime mortgage loans in its securities portfolio. However, the Bancorp has exposure to disruptions in the capital markets and weakened economic conditions. Throughout 2010, the Bancorp continued to be affected by high unemployment rates, weakened housing markets, particularly in the upper Midwest and Florida, and a challenging credit environment. Credit trends, however, continued to show signs of moderation in 2010 and, as a result, the provision for loan and lease losses decreased to $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $3.5 billion during 2009.  

Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases decreased to 3.02% in 2010 compared to 3.20% in 2009. In the third quarter of 2010, the Bancorp took significant actions to reduce credit risk. Residential mortgage loans in the Bancorps portfolio with a carrying value of $228 million were sold for $105 million, generating $123 million in net charge-offs. Additionally, commercial loans with a carrying value prior to transfer of $961 million were transferred to held-for-sale, generating $387 million in net charge-offs. Including the impact of these actions, nonperforming assets as 

 a percent of loans, leases and other assets, including other real estate owned (excluding nonaccrual loans held for sale) decreased to 2.79% at December 31, 2010, from 4.22% at December 31, 2009. Refer to the Credit Risk Management section in MD&A for more information on credit quality.  

The Bancorp took a number of actions to strengthen its capital position in 2009. On June 4, 2009, the Bancorp completed an at-the-market offering resulting in the sale of $1 billion of its common shares at an average share price of $6.33. In addition, on June 17, 2009, the Bancorp completed its offer to exchange shares of its common stock and cash for shares of its Series G convertible preferred stock. As a result, the Bancorp recognized an increase in net income available to common shareholders of $35 million based upon the difference in carrying value of the Series G preferred shares and the fair value of the common shares and cash issued. See the Capital Management section of MD&A for further information on the Bancorps capital transactions.  

The Bancorps capital ratios exceed the well-capitalized guidelines as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. As of December 31, 2010, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.94%, the Tier 1 leverage ratio was 12.79% and the total risk-based capital ratio was 18.14%.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

The Bancorp considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including the tangible equity ratio, tangible common equity ratio and tier I common equity ratio, in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators. These calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes. Because U.S. GAAP does not include capital ratio measures, the Bancorp believes there are no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures to these ratios. Tier I common equity is not formally defined by U.S. GAAP or codified in the federal banking regulations and, therefore, is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess the Bancorps capital adequacy using these ratios, the Bancorp believes they are useful to provide investors the ability to assess its capital adequacy on the same basis. 

The Bancorp believes these non-GAAP measures are important because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of the Bancorps capitalization to other organizations. However, because there are no standardized definitions for these ratios, the Bancorps calculations may not be comparable with other organizations, and the usefulness of these measures to investors may be limited. As a result, the Bancorp encourages readers to consider its Consolidated Financial Statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.  

The following table reconciles non-GAAP financial measures to U.S. GAAP as of December 31: 

TABLE 3: NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Under the banking agencies risk-based capital guidelines, assets and credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned to broad risk categories. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk category is multiplied by the associated risk weight of the category. The resulting weighted values are added together, resulting in the Bancorps total risk-weighted assets.  

RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides a discussion of the significant new accounting standards adopted by the Bancorp during 2010 and 2009 and the expected impact of significant accounting standards issued, but not yet required to be adopted.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies, economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the value of the Bancorps assets or liabilities and results of operations and cash flows. The Bancorps critical accounting policies include the accounting for the ALLL, reserve for unfunded commitments, income taxes, valuation of servicing rights, fair value measurements and goodwill. No material changes were made to the valuation techniques or models described below during the year ended December 31, 2010.  

ALLL  

The Bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the ALLL. The Bancorps portfolio segments include commercial, residential mortgage, and consumer. The Bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics. Classes within the commercial portfolio segment include commercial & industrial, commercial mortgage owner-occupied, commercial mortgage nonowner-occupied, commercial construction, and commercial leasing. The residential mortgage portfolio segment is also considered a class. Classes within the consumer segment include home equity, automobile, credit card, and other consumer loans and leases. For an analysis of the Bancorps ALLL by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Larger commercial loans included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, as well as loans that have been modified in a TDR, are subject to individual review for impairment. The Bancorp considers the current value of collateral, credit quality of any guarantees, the loan structure, and other factors when evaluating whether an individual loan is impaired. Other factors may include the industry of the borrower, size and financial condition of the borrower, cash flow, leverage of the borrower, and the Bancorps evaluation of the borrowers management. When individual loans are impaired, allowances are determined based on managements estimate of the borrowers ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral, other sources of cash flow, as well as evaluation of legal options available to the Bancorp. Allowances for impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, fair value of the underlying collateral or readily observable secondary market values. The Bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual.  

Historical credit loss rates are applied to commercial loans that are not impaired or are impaired, but smaller than the established threshold of $1 million and thus not subject to specific allowance allocations. The loss rates are derived from a migration analysis, which tracks the historical net charge-off experience sustained on loans according to their internal risk grade. The risk grading system currently utilized for allowance analysis purposes encompasses ten categories.  

 Homogenous loans and leases in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments are not individually risk graded. Rather, standard credit scoring systems and delinquency monitoring are used to assess credit risks, and allowances are established based on the expected net charge-offs. Loss rates are based on the average net charge-off history by loan category. Historical loss rates may be adjusted for significant factors that, in managements judgment, are 

 necessary to reflect losses inherent in the portfolio. Factors that management considers in the analysis include the effects of the national and local economies; trends in the nature and volume of delinquencies, charge-offs and nonaccrual loans; changes in loan mix; credit score migration comparisons; asset quality trends; risk management and loan administration; changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards; collection practices; and examination results from bank regulatory agencies and the Bancorps internal credit reviewers.  

The Bancorps current methodology for determining the ALLL is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on TDRs and impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. Allowances on individual commercial loans and historical loss rates are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower and/or collateral conditions and actual collection and charge-off experience. An unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring losses when evaluating allowances for individual loans or pools of loans.  

Loans acquired by the Bancorp through a purchase business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The Bancorp does not carry over the acquired companys ALLL, nor does the Bancorp add to its existing ALLL as part of purchase accounting.  

The Bancorps primary market areas for lending are the Midwestern and Southeastern regions of the United States. When evaluating the adequacy of allowances, consideration is given to these regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect changing economic conditions have on the Bancorps customers.  

Reserve for Unfunded Commitments  

The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates based on credit grade migration. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

Income Taxes  

The Bancorp estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to the various tax jurisdictions in which the Bancorp conducts business. On a quarterly basis, management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate based upon its current estimate of the amount and components of net income, tax credits and the applicable statutory tax rates expected for the full year. The estimated income tax expense is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the balance sheet method and are reported in other assets and accrued taxes, interest and expenses, respectively in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates and laws. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent they exist and are subject to a valuation allowance based on managements judgment that realization is more-likely-than-not. This analysis is performed on a quarterly basis and includes an evaluation of all positive and negative evidence to determine whether realization is more-likely-than-not.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due to taxing jurisdictions and are reported in accrued taxes, interest and expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Bancorp evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent and other information and maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these relative risks and merits. Changes to the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by taxing authorities and changes to statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, can affect deferred taxes and accrued taxes as well as the current periods income tax expense and can be significant to the operating results of the Bancorp. For additional information on income taxes, see Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Valuation of Servicing Rights  

When the Bancorp sells loans through either securitizations or individual loan sales in accordance with its investment policies, it often obtains servicing rights. Servicing rights resulting from loan sales are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. Servicing rights are assessed for impairment monthly, based on fair value, with temporary impairment recognized through a valuation allowance and permanent impairment recognized through a write-off of the servicing asset and related valuation allowance. Key economic assumptions used in measuring any potential impairment of the servicing rights include the prepayment speeds of the underlying loans, the weighted-average life, the discount rate, the weighted-average coupon and the weighted-average default rate, as applicable. The primary risk of material changes to the value of the servicing rights resides in the potential volatility in the economic assumptions used, particularly the prepayment speeds.  

The Bancorp monitors risk and adjusts its valuation allowance as necessary to adequately reserve for impairment in the servicing portfolio. For purposes of measuring impairment, the mortgage servicing rights are stratified into classes based on the financial asset type and interest rates. Fees received for servicing loans owned by investors are based on a percentage of the outstanding monthly principal balance of such loans and are included in noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income as loan payments are received. Costs of servicing loans are charged to expense as incurred. For additional information on servicing rights, see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Fair Value Measurements  

The Bancorp measures fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques the Bancorp uses to measure fair value include the market approach, income approach and cost approach. The market approach uses prices 

 or relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach involves discounting future amounts to a single present amount and is based on current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of the asset.  

U.S. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the instruments fair value measurement. The three levels within the fair value hierarchy are described as follows:  

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Bancorp has the ability to access at the measurement date.  

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.  

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability for which there is little, if any, market activity at the measurement date. Unobservable inputs reflect the Bancorps own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include the Bancorps own financial data such as internally developed pricing models and discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant management judgment.  

The Bancorps fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models, which involve inputs that are observable, when available, and include the following significant instruments: available-for-sale and trading securities, residential mortgage loans held for investment and held for sale and certain derivatives. The following is a summary of valuation techniques utilized by the Bancorp for its significant assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  

Available-for-sale and trading securities  

Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Level 1 securities include government bonds and exchange traded equities. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows. Examples of such instruments, which are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy, include agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities, obligations of U.S. Government sponsored agencies, and corporate and municipal bonds. Agency mortgage-backed securities, obligations of U.S. Government sponsored agencies, and corporate and municipal bonds are generally valued using a market approach based on observable prices of securities with similar characteristics. Non-agency mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities are generally valued using an income approach based on discounted cash flows, incorporating prepayment speeds, performance of underlying collateral and specific tranche-level attributes. In certain cases where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to the valuation, securities are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Trading securities classified as Level 3 consist of auction rate securities. Due to the illiquidity in the market for these types of securities at December 31, 2010, the Bancorp measured fair value using a discount rate based on the assumed holding period.

Residential mortgage loans held for sale and held for investment  

For residential mortgage loans held for sale, fair value is estimated based upon mortgage-backed securities prices and spreads to those prices or, for certain ARM loans, discounted cash flow models that may incorporate the anticipated portfolio composition, credit spreads of asset-backed securities with similar collateral, and market conditions. The anticipated portfolio composition includes the effect of interest rate spreads and discount rates due to loan characteristics such as the state in which the loan was originated, the loan amount and the ARM margin. Residential mortgage loans held for sale that are valued based on mortgage-backed securities prices are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as the valuation is based on external pricing for similar instruments. ARM loans classified as held for sale are also classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy due to the use of observable inputs in the discounted cash flow model. These observable inputs include interest rate spreads from agency mortgage-backed securities market rates and observable discount rates. For residential mortgage loans reclassified from held for sale to held for investment, the fair value estimation is based primarily on the underlying collateral values. Therefore, these loans are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  

Derivatives  

Exchange-traded derivatives valued using quoted prices and certain over-the-counter derivatives valued using active bids are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Most of the Bancorps derivative contracts are valued using discounted cash flow or other models that incorporate current market interest rates, credit spreads assigned to the derivative counterparties, and other market parameters and, therefore, are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Such derivatives include basic and structured interest rate swaps and options. Derivatives that are valued based upon models with significant unobservable market parameters are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. At December 31, 2010, derivatives classified as Level 3, which are valued using an option-pricing model containing unobservable inputs, consisted primarily of warrants and put rights associated with the Processing Business Sale and a total return swap associated with the Bancorps sale of its Visa, Inc. Class B shares. Level 3 derivatives also include interest rate lock commitments, which utilize internally generated loan closing rate assumptions as a significant unobservable input in the valuation process.  

 Valuation techniques and parameters used for measuring assets and liabilities are reviewed and validated by the Bancorp on a quarterly basis. Additionally, the Bancorp monitors the fair values of significant assets and liabilities using a variety of methods including the evaluation of pricing 

 runs and exception reports based on certain analytical criteria, comparison to previous trades and overall review and assessments for reasonableness.  

In addition to the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the Bancorp measures servicing rights, certain loans and long-lived assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Refer to Note 28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on fair value measurements.  

Goodwill  

Business combinations entered into by the Bancorp typically include the acquisition of goodwill. U.S. GAAP requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the Bancorps reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Bancorp is September 30, and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment. The Bancorp has determined that its segments qualify as reporting units under U.S. GAAP. Impairment exists when a reporting units carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, which is determined through a two-step impairment test. The first step (Step 1) compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step (Step 2) of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the impairment loss amount, if any.  

The fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Since none of the Bancorps reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the Bancorps stock price. To determine the fair value of a reporting unit, the Bancorp employs an income-based approach, utilizing the reporting units forecasted cash flows (including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast) and the reporting units estimated cost of equity as the discount rate. Additionally, the Bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the Bancorps stock during the month including the measurement date, incorporating an additional control premium, and allocates this market-based fair value measurement to the Bancorps reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach.  

When required to perform Step 2, the Bancorp compares the implied fair value of a reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value, an impairment loss equal to that excess amount is recognized. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of that goodwill and cannot be reversed even if the fair value of the reporting unit recovers.  

 During Step 2, the Bancorp determines the implied fair value of goodwill for a reporting unit by assigning the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This assignment process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment. The Bancorp does not adjust the carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities (other than goodwill, if appropriate), nor recognize previously unrecognized intangible assets in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a result of this assignment process. Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the Bancorps goodwill.

RISK FACTORS  

The risks listed here are not the only risks that Fifth Third faces. Additional risks that are not presently known or that Fifth Third presently deems to be immaterial could also have a material, adverse impact on its financial condition, the results of its operations, or its business.  

RISKS RELATING TO ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS  

Weakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including specific weakness within Fifth Thirds geographic footprint, has adversely affected Fifth Third and may continue to adversely affect Fifth Third.  

If the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which Fifth Third conducts operations declines or does not improve in a reasonable time frame, this could result in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit, including a resultant effect on Fifth Thirds loan portfolio and ALLL and in the receipt of lower proceeds from the sale of loans and foreclosed properties. A significant portion of Fifth Thirds residential mortgage and commercial real estate loan portfolios are comprised of borrowers in Michigan, Northern Ohio and Florida, which markets have been particularly adversely affected by job losses, declines in real estate value, declines in home sale volumes, and declines in new home building. These factors could result in higher delinquencies, greater charge-offs and increased losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate in future periods, which could materially adversely affect Fifth Thirds financial condition and results of operations.  

Changes in interest rates could affect Fifth Thirds income and cash flows.  

Fifth Thirds income and cash flows depend to a great extent on the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond Fifth Thirds control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies (in particular, the FRB). Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans, the prepayment speed of loans, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits or other sources of funding. The impact of these changes may be magnified if Fifth Third does not effectively manage the relative sensitivity of its assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates. Fluctuations in these areas may adversely affect Fifth Third and its shareholders.  

Changes and trends in the capital markets may affect Fifth Thirds income and cash flows.  

Fifth Third enters into and maintains trading and investment positions in the capital markets on its own behalf and manages investment positions on behalf of its customers. These investment positions include derivative financial instruments. The revenues and profits Fifth Third derives from managing proprietary and customer trading and investment positions are dependent on market prices. If Fifth Third does not correctly anticipate market changes and trends, Fifth Third may experience a decline in investment advisory revenue or investment or trading losses that may materially affect Fifth Third. Losses on behalf of its customers could expose Fifth Third to litigation, credit risks or loss of revenue from those customers. Additionally, substantial losses in Fifth Thirds 

 trading and investment positions could lead to a loss with respect to those investments and may adversely affect cash flows and funding costs.  

The removal or reduction in stimulus activities sponsored by the Federal Government and its agents may have a negative impact on Fifth Thirds results and operations.  

The Federal Government has intervened in an unprecedented manner to stimulate economic growth. Some of these activities have included the following:  

       Target fed funds rates which have remained close to zero percent;  

       Mortgage rates that have remained at historical lows in part due to the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorks $1.25 trillion mortgage-backed securities purchase program;  

       Bank funding that has remained stable through an increase in FDIC deposit insurance to a covered limit of $250,000 per account from the previous coverage limit of $100,000; and  

       Housing demand that has been stimulated by homebuyer tax credits.  

The expiration or rescission of any of these programs may have an adverse impact on Fifth Thirds operating results by increasing interest rates, increasing the cost of funding, and reducing the demand for loan products, including mortgage loans.  

Problems encountered by financial institutions larger than or similar to Fifth Third could adversely affect financial markets generally and have indirect adverse effects on Fifth Third.  

The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which the Bancorp interacts on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect Fifth Third.  

Fifth Thirds stock price is volatile.  

Fifth Thirds stock price has been volatile in the past and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate substantially in the future. These factors include:  

       Actual or anticipated variations in earnings;  

       Changes in analysts recommendations or projections;  

       Fifth Thirds announcements of developments related to its businesses;  

       Operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;  

       Actions by government regulators;  

       New technology used or services offered by traditional and non-traditional competitors; and  

       News reports of trends, concerns and other issues related to the financial services industry.  

The price for shares of Fifth Thirds common stock may fluctuate significantly in the future, and these fluctuations may be unrelated to Fifth Thirds performance. General market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price for shares of Fifth Thirds common stock, and the current market price of such shares may not be indicative of future market prices.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

RISKS RELATING TO FIFTH THIRDS GENERAL BUSINESS  

Deteriorating credit quality, particularly in real estate loans, has adversely impacted Fifth Third and may continue to adversely impact Fifth Third.  

Fifth Third has experienced a downturn in credit performance and credit conditions and the performance of its loan portfolio could deteriorate in the future. The downturn caused Fifth Third to increase its ALLL, driven primarily by higher allocations related to residential mortgage and home equity loans, commercial real estate loans and loans of entities related to or dependent upon the real estate industry. If the performance of Fifth Thirds loan portfolio does not continue to improve and/or stabilize, additional increases in the ALLL may be necessary in the future. Accordingly, a decrease in the quality of Fifth Thirds credit portfolio could have a material adverse effect on earnings and results of operations.  

Fifth Third must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.  

Fifth Third must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. Fifth Thirds ability to maintain sources of funding and liquidity could be impacted by changes in the capital markets in which it operates. Additionally, if Fifth Third sought additional sources of capital, liquidity or funding, those additional sources could dilute current shareholders ownership interests.  

If Fifth Third does not adjust to rapid changes in the financial services industry, its financial performance may suffer.  

Fifth Thirds ability to deliver strong financial performance and returns on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the needs and demands of its customers. In addition to the challenge of competing against other banks in attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, Fifth Thirds competitors also include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors, specialty finance and insurance companies who seek to offer one-stop financial services that may include services that banks have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past or may not be currently able or allowed to offer. This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems, as well as the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers.  

If Fifth Third is unable to grow its deposits, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs.  

The total amount that Fifth Third pays for funding costs is dependent, in part, on Fifth Thirds ability to grow its deposits. If Fifth Third is unable to sufficiently grow its deposits, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs. This could materially adversely affect Fifth Thirds earnings and results of operations.  

Fifth Thirds ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries accounts for most of its revenue and could affect its liquidity and ability to pay dividends.   

Fifth Third Bancorp is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. Fifth Third Bancorp typically receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on Fifth Third Bancorps stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the 

 amount of dividends that Fifth Thirds bank and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. Also, Fifth Third Bancorps right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiarys creditors. Limitations on Fifth Thirds ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on Fifth Thirds liquidity and ability to pay dividends on stock or interest and principal on its debt.  

The financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect Fifth Thirds revenue and profitability.  

The financial services industry in which Fifth Third operates is highly competitive. Fifth Third competes not only with commercial banks, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the internet. Fifth Third competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. Recently, this trend accelerated considerably, as several major U.S. financial institutions consolidated, were forced to merge, received substantial government assistance or were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. Government. These developments could result in Fifth Thirds competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. Fifth Third may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices.  

Fifth Third and/or the holders of its securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable ratings from rating agencies.  

Fifth Thirds ability to access the capital markets is important to its overall funding profile. This access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to Fifth Third, certain of its subsidiaries and particular classes of securities they issue. The interest rates that Fifth Third pays on its securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that it, its subsidiaries and/or its securities receive from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to Fifth Third or its subsidiaries credit rating could affect its ability to access the capital markets, increase its borrowing costs and negatively impact its profitability. A ratings downgrade to Fifth Third, its subsidiaries or their securities could also create obligations or liabilities to Fifth Third under the terms of its outstanding securities that could increase Fifth Thirds costs or otherwise have a negative effect on the Bancorps results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by Fifth Third or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold. On November 1, 2010, citing their view that the likelihood of government support in the future for larger regional banks had declined, Moodys downgraded ten large regional banks, including Fifth Thirds subsidiary bank, Fifth Third Bank. Fifth Third Banks credit ratings for short-term obligations, long-term deposit and senior debt were downgraded to P2, A3 and A3, respectively, from P1, A2 and A2, respectively. During 2010, DBRS Investors Service downgraded Fifth Thirds issuer rating to AL from A and downgraded the long term debt rating and deposit ratings for Fifth Thirds bank subsidiary to A from AH.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Fifth Third could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.  

As Fifth Third continues to grow, its success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that Fifth Third serves is great and Fifth Third may not be able to hire these candidates and retain them. If Fifth Third is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, Fifth Third may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, operations and financial condition.  

Pursuant to the standardized terms of the CPP, among other things, Fifth Third has agreed to institute certain restrictions on the compensation of certain senior management positions, which could have an adverse effect on Fifth Thirds ability to hire or retain the most qualified senior management. It is possible that the U.S. Treasury may, as it is permitted to do, impose further requirements on Fifth Third. In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued joint guidance on executive compensation intended to ensure that a bank organizations incentive compensation policies dont encourage excessive risk taking. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires those agencies to adopt guidance or rules to enhance the reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. Also in 2010, the FDIC issued a request for comments on whether banks with compensation plans that encourage excessive risk taking should be charged at higher deposit assessment rates than such banks would otherwise be charged. If Fifth Third is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more expensive, Fifth Thirds performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.  

Fifth Thirds mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to quarter.  

Fifth Third earns revenue from the fees it receives for originating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans tends to fall, reducing the revenue Fifth Third receives from loan originations. At the same time, revenue from MSRs can increase through increases in fair value. When rates fall, mortgage originations tend to increase and the value of MSRs tends to decline, also with some offsetting revenue effect. Even though they can act as a natural hedge, the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example, the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value of residential MSRs is immediate, but any offsetting revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to the new loans would accrue over time. It is also possible that, because of the recession and deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates.  

 Fifth Third typically uses derivatives and other instruments to hedge its mortgage banking interest rate risk. Fifth Third generally does not hedge all of its risks, and the fact that Fifth Third attempts to hedge any of the risks does not mean Fifth Third will be successful. Hedging is a complex process, requiring sophisticated models and constant monitoring, and is not a perfect science. Fifth Third may use hedging instruments tied to U.S. Treasury rates, LIBOR or Eurodollars that may not perfectly correlate with the value or income being hedged. Fifth Third could incur significant losses from its hedging activities. There may be periods where Fifth Third elects not to use derivatives and other instruments to hedge mortgage banking interest rate risk. 

The preparation of Fifth Thirds financial statements requires the use of estimates that may vary from actual results.  

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Two of Fifth Thirds most critical estimates are the level of the ALLL and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Due to the uncertainty of estimates involved, Fifth Third may have to significantly increase the ALLL and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance and could recognize a significant provision for impairment of its mortgage servicing rights. If Fifth Thirds ALLL is not adequate, Fifth Thirds business, financial condition, including its liquidity and capital, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  

Fifth Third regularly reviews its litigation reserves for adequacy considering its litigation risks and probability of incurring losses related to litigation. However, Fifth Third cannot be certain that its current litigation reserves will be adequate over time to cover its losses in litigation due to higher than anticipated settlement costs, prolonged litigation, adverse judgments, or other factors that are largely outside of Fifth Thirds control. If Fifth Thirds litigation reserves are not adequate, Fifth Thirds business, financial condition, including its liquidity and capital, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, in the future, Fifth Third may increase its litigation reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on its capital and results of operations.  

Changes in accounting standards could impact Fifth Thirds reported earnings and financial condition.  

The accounting standard setters, including the FASB, the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Fifth Thirds consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how Fifth Third records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, Fifth Third could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the recasting of Fifth Thirds prior period financial statements.  

Future acquisitions may dilute current shareholders ownership of Fifth Third and may cause Fifth Third to become more susceptible to adverse economic events.  

Future business acquisitions could be material to Fifth Third and it may issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions, which would dilute current shareholders ownership interests. Acquisitions also could require Fifth Third to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt. In those events, Fifth Third could become more susceptible to economic downturns and competitive pressures.  

Difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with Fifth Thirds own operations may prevent Fifth Third from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.  

Inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. Fifth Third may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. In addition, the markets and industries in which Fifth Third and its potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. Fifth Third may lose customers or the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. Future acquisition and integration activities may require Fifth Third to devote substantial time and resources and as a result Fifth Third may not be able to pursue other business opportunities.  

After completing an acquisition, Fifth Third may find certain items are not accounted for properly in accordance 

     Fifth Third Bancorp    25 

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 with financial accounting and reporting standards. Fifth Third may also not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. For example, Fifth Third could experience higher charge offs than originally anticipated related to the acquired loan portfolio.  

Fifth Third may sell or consider selling one or more of its businesses. Should it determine to sell such a business, it may not be able to generate gains on sale or related increase in shareholders equity commensurate with desirable levels. Moreover, if Fifth Third sold such businesses, the loss of income could have an adverse effect on its earnings and future growth.  

Fifth Third owns several non-strategic businesses that are not significantly synergistic with its core financial services businesses. Fifth Third has, from time to time, considered the sale of such businesses. If it were to determine to sell such businesses, Fifth Third would be subject to market forces that may make completion of a sale unsuccessful or may not be able to do so within a desirable time frame. If Fifth Third were to complete the sale of non-core businesses, it would suffer the loss of income from the sold businesses, and such loss of income could have an adverse effect on its future earnings and growth.  

Material breaches in security of Fifth Thirds systems may have a significant effect on Fifth Thirds business.  

Fifth Third collects, processes and stores sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both Fifth Third and third party service providers. Fifth Third has security, backup and recovery systems in place, as well as a business continuity plan to ensure the system will not be inoperable. Fifth Third also has security to prevent unauthorized access to the system. In addition, Fifth Third requires its third party service providers to maintain similar controls. However, Fifth Third cannot be certain that the measures will be successful. A security breach in the system and loss of confidential information such as credit card numbers and related information could result in losing the customers confidence and thus the loss of their business as well as additional significant costs for privacy monitoring activities.  

Fifth Third is exposed to operational and reputational risk.  

Fifth Third is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, environmental risks from its properties, the risk of fraud or theft by employees, customers or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees, operating system disruptions or operational errors.  

 Negative public opinion can result from Fifth Thirds actual or alleged conduct in activities, such as lending practices, data security, corporate governance and acquisitions, and may damage Fifth Thirds reputation. Negative public opinion has been observed in relation to banks participating in the U.S. Treasurys TARP program, in which Fifth Third was a participant. Additionally, actions taken by government regulators and community organizations may also damage Fifth Thirds reputation. This negative public opinion can adversely affect Fifth Thirds ability to attract and keep customers and can expose it to litigation and regulatory action.  

Fifth Thirds necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process its transaction volume poses the risk that technical system flaws or employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses and may be difficult to detect. Fifth Third may also be subject to disruptions of its operating systems arising from events that are beyond its control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages). Fifth Third is further exposed to the risk that its third party service providers 

 may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors as Fifth Third). These disruptions may interfere with service to Fifth Thirds customers and result in a financial loss or liability.  

The inability of FTPS to succeed as a stand-alone entity could have a negative impact on Fifth Thirds operating results and financial condition.  

During the second quarter of 2009, Fifth Third sold an approximate 51% interest in FTPS to Advent International. Prior to the sale, FTPS relied on Fifth Third to support its operating and administrative functions. Fifth Third has entered into agreements to provide FTPS certain services during the deconversion period. Fifth Thirds operating results may suffer if the cost of providing these services exceeds the amount received from FTPS. As part of the sale, FTPS also assumed loans owed Fifth Third. Repayment of these loans is contingent on future cash flows and profitability at FTPS.  

In connection with the sale, Fifth Third provided Advent International with certain put rights that are exercisable in the event of three unlikely circumstances. Based on Fifth Thirds current ownership share in FTPS of approximately 49%, FTPS is accounted for under the equity method and is not consolidated. The exercise of the put rights would result in FTPS becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Fifth Third. As a result, FTPS would be consolidated and would subject Fifth Third to the risks inherent in integrating a business. Additionally, such a change in the accounting treatment for FTPS may adversely impact Fifth Thirds capital.  

Weather related events or other natural disasters may have an effect on the performance of Fifth Thirds loan portfolios, especially in its coastal markets, thereby adversely impacting its results of operations.  

Fifth Thirds footprint stretches from the upper Midwestern to lower Southeastern regions of the United States. This area has experienced weather events including hurricanes and other natural disasters. The nature and level of these events and the impact of global climate change upon their frequency and severity cannot be predicted. If large scale events occur, they may significantly impact its loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral as well as impairing its borrowers ability to repay their loans.  

RISKS RELATED TO THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT  

As a regulated entity, Fifth Third must maintain certain capital requirements that may limit its operations and potential growth.  

Fifth Third is a bank holding company and a financial holding company. As such, Fifth Third is subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation of the FRB, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements. Fifth Third must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios as required by its banking regulators and which can change depending upon general economic conditions and Fifth Thirds particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. Compliance with the capital requirements, including leverage ratios, may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect Fifth Thirds ability to expand or maintain present business levels.  

Fifth Thirds subsidiary bank must remain well-capitalized, well-managed and maintain at least a Satisfactory CRA rating for Fifth Third to retain its status as a financial holding company. Failure to meet these requirements could result in the FRB placing limitations or conditions on Fifth Thirds activities (and the commencement of new activities) and could

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 ultimately result in the loss of financial holding company status. In addition, failure by Fifth Thirds bank subsidiary to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities. These include limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC.  

Fifth Thirds business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by new or changed regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are applied by regulatory authorities.  

Current economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies placing increased focus on and scrutiny of the financial services industry. The U.S. Government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. In addition to the Bancorps participation in U.S. Treasurys CPP and Capital Assistance Program, the U.S. Government has taken steps that include enhancing the liquidity support available to financial institutions, establishing a commercial paper funding facility, temporarily guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt issuances, and increasing insured deposits. These programs subject the Bancorp and other financial institutions who have participated in these programs to additional restrictions, oversight and/or costs that may have an impact on the Bancorps business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of its common stock.  

Compliance with such regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase the Bancorps costs, impede the efficiency of its internal business processes, require it to increase its regulatory capital and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. The Bancorp also may be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. The increased costs associated with anticipated regulatory and political scrutiny could adversely impact the Bancorps results of operations.  

New proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry. The Bancorp cannot predict whether any pending or future legislation will be adopted or the substance and impact of any such new legislation on the Bancorp. Additional regulation could affect the Bancorp in a substantial way and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Fifth Third is subject to various regulatory requirements that limit its operations and potential growth.  

Under federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to the safety and soundness of insured depository institutions and their holding companies, the FRB and the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions have the authority to compel or restrict certain actions by Fifth Third and its subsidiary bank. Fifth Third and its subsidiary bank are subject to such supervisory authority and, more generally, must, in certain instances, obtain prior regulatory approval before engaging in certain activities or corporate decisions. There can be no assurance that such approvals, if required, would be forthcoming or that such approvals would be granted in a timely manner. Failure to receive any such approval, if required, could limit or impair Fifth Thirds operations, restrict its growth and/or affect its dividend policy. Such actions and activities subject to prior approval include, but are not limited to, increasing dividends paid by Fifth Third or its subsidiary bank, purchasing or redeeming any shares of its stock, entering into a merger or 

 acquisition transaction, acquiring or establishing new branches, and entering into new businesses.  

In addition, Fifth Third, as well as other financial institutions more generally, have recently been subjected to increased scrutiny from regulatory authorities stemming from broader systemic regulatory concerns, including with respect to stress testing, capital levels, asset quality, provisioning and other prudential matters, arising as a result of the recent financial crisis and efforts to ensure that financial institutions take steps to improve their risk management and prevent future crises.  

In some cases, regulatory agencies may take supervisory actions that are considered to be confidential supervisory information which may not be publicly disclosed. Finally, as part of Fifth Thirds regular examination process, Fifth Thirds and its subsidiary banks respective regulators may advise it and its subsidiary bank to operate under various restrictions as a prudential matter. Such supervisory actions or restrictions, if and in whatever manner imposed, could have a material adverse effect on Fifth Thirds business and results of operations.  

Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies which may lead to adverse consequences.  

Fifth Third and/or its affiliates are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by government and self-regulatory agencies, including the SEC, regarding their respective businesses. Such matters may result in material adverse consequences, including without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other actions, amendments and/or restatements of Fifth Thirds SEC filings and/or financial statements, as applicable, and/or determinations of material weaknesses in its disclosure controls and procedures. The SEC is investigating and has made several requests for information, including by subpoena, concerning issues which Fifth Third understands relate to accounting and reporting matters involving certain of its commercial loans. This could lead to an enforcement proceeding by the SEC which, in turn, may result in one or more such material adverse consequences.  

Deposit insurance premiums levied against Fifth Third may increase if the number of bank failures do not subside or the cost of resolving failed banks increases.  

The FDIC maintains a DIF to resolve the cost of bank failures. The DIF is funded by fees assessed on insured depository institutions including Fifth Third. The magnitude and cost of resolving an increased number of bank failures have reduced the DIF. In 2009, the FDIC collected a special assessment to replenish the DIF. In addition, a prepayment of an estimated amount of future deposit insurance premiums was made on December 30, 2009. Future deposit premiums paid by Fifth Third depend on the level of the DIF and the magnitude and cost of future bank failures.  

Legislative or regulatory compliance, changes or actions or significant litigation, could adversely impact the Bancorp or the businesses in which the Bancorp is engaged.  

The Bancorp is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations and limit the businesses in which the Bancorp may engage. These laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance funds. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact the Bancorp or 

     Fifth Third Bancorp    27

 its ability to increase the value of its business. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against the Bancorp could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defending itself and may lead to penalties that materially affect the Bancorp and its shareholders. Future changes in the laws, including tax laws, or, as a participant in the CPP under the EESA, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, or regulations or their interpretations or enforcement may also be materially adverse to the Bancorp and its shareholders or may require the Bancorp to expend significant time and resources to comply with such requirements.  

On July 21, 2010 the President of the United States signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act will have material implications for Fifth Third and the entire financial services industry. Among other things it will or potentially could:  

       Result in Fifth Third being subject to enhanced oversight and scrutiny as a result of being a bank holding company with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets;  

       Result in the appointment of the FDIC as receiver of Fifth Third in an orderly liquidation proceeding, if the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, upon recommendation of two-thirds of the FRB and the FDIC and in consultation with the President of the United States, finds Fifth Third to be in default or danger of default;  

       Affect the levels of capital and liquidity with which Fifth Third must operate and how it plans capital and liquidity levels (including a phased-in elimination of Fifth Thirds existing trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital);  

       Subject Fifth Third to new and/or higher fees paid to various regulatory entities, including but not limited to deposit insurance fees to the FDIC;  

       Impact Fifth Thirds ability to invest in certain types of entities or engage in certain activities;  

       Impact a number of Fifth Thirds business and risk management strategies;  

       Restrict the revenue that Fifth Third generates from certain businesses, including interchange fee revenue generated by Fifth Thirds credit card business;  

       Subject Fifth Third to a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which will have very broad rule-making and enforcement authorities; and  

       Subject Fifth Third to oversight and regulation by a new and different litigation and regulatory regime.  

As the Dodd-Frank Act requires that many studies be conducted and that hundreds of regulations be written in order to fully implement it, the full impact of this legislation on Fifth Third, its business strategies and financial performance cannot be known at this time, and may not be known for a number of years. However, these impacts are expected to be substantial and some of them are likely to adversely affect Fifth Third and its financial performance. The extent to which Fifth Third can adjust its strategies to offset such adverse impacts also is not known at this time. 

Fifth Third and other financial institutions have been the subject of increased litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to its reputation.  

Fifth Third and certain of its directors and officers have been named from time to time as defendants in various class actions and other litigation relating to Fifth Thirds business and activities. Past, present and future litigation have included or could include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Fifth Third is also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding its business. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Like other large financial institutions and companies, Fifth Third is also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against Fifth Third could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations and/or cause significant reputational harm to its business.  

Fifth Thirds ability to pay or increase dividends on its common stock or to repurchase its capital stock is restricted.  

Fifth Thirds ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock is subject to regulatory requirements and the need to meet regulatory expectations.

STATEMENTS OF INCOME ANALYSIS  

Net Interest Income  

Net interest income is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and leases (including yield-related fees) and other interest-earning assets less the interest paid for core deposits (includes transaction deposits and other time deposits) and wholesale funding (includes certificates $100,000 and over, other deposits, federal funds purchased, short-term borrowings and long-term debt). The net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest rate spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread due to the interest income earned on those assets that are funded by non-interest-bearing liabilities, or free-funding, such as demand deposits or shareholders equity.  

Table 5 presents the components of net interest income, net interest margin and net interest spread for 2010, 2009 and 2008. Nonaccrual loans and leases and loans held for sale have been included in the average loan and lease balances. Average outstanding securities balances are based on amortized cost with any unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities included in other assets. Table 6 provides the relative impact of changes in the balance sheet and changes in interest rates on net interest income.  

Net interest income was $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to $3.4 billion in 2009. Net interest income was affected by the amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts on acquired loans and deposits, primarily from the acquisition of First Charter that increased net interest income by $68 million during 2010, compared to an increase of $136 million during 2009. Excluding this impact, net interest income increased $317 million, or 10%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The purchase accounting accretion reflects the high discount rate in the market at the time of the acquisition; the total loan discounts are being accreted into net interest income over the remaining period to maturity of the loans acquired. Based upon the remaining period to maturity, and excluding the impact of prepayments, the Bancorp anticipates recognizing approximately $41 million in additional net interest income during 2011 as a result of the amortization and accretion of premiums and discounts on acquired loans and deposits.  

For the year ended December 31, 2010, net interest income was positively impacted by a decrease of $5.6 billion in average interest-bearing liabilities as well as a mix shift to lower cost core deposits from 2009. This was primarily a result of runoff of higher priced term deposits as well as the 

 benefit of lower rates offered on new term deposits. In addition, 2010 benefitted from a $3.2 billion increase in the free funding position. This benefit was partially offset by a $2.6 billion decrease in average interest earning assets from 2009. The shift in funding position, as well as improved pricing on commercial loans, led to a 39 bp increase in the net interest rate spread to 3.39% in 2010 compared to 2009.  

Net interest margin was 3.66% in 2010, compared to 3.32% in 2009. For 2010 and 2009, the accretion of the discounts on acquired loans and deposits increased the net interest margin by 7 bp and 14 bp, respectively. Excluding the accretion of discounts on acquired loans and deposits, net interest margin was up 41 bp from 2009, driven by improved pricing on new commercial loan originations, the shift in funding composition to lower cost core deposits, an increase in free-funding balances and a decrease in the average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities.  

Average interest-earning assets decreased three percent from 2009. Average commercial loans decreased $3.9 billion due to decreases across all commercial loan categories, and average consumer loans decreased $239 million due primarily to decreases in average residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans and leases, partially offset by an increase in average automobile loans. In addition, average investment securities decreased $729 million, or four percent, compared to 2009. The declines in average loans and investment securities were partially offset by a $2.3 billion increase in average other short-term investments, which includes interest bearing cash held at the Federal Reserve. For further discussion on the Bancorps loan and lease and investment securities portfolios, see the Loan and Lease and Investment Securities sections, respectively, of MD&A.  

Interest income from loans and leases decreased $112 million compared to 2009. Excluding the accretion of discounts on acquired loans in 2010 and 2009, interest income from loans and leases decreased $46 million, or one percent, compared to the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in interest income from loans and leases is a result of a five percent decline in average balances, partially offset by an 11 bp increase in the average yield. Interest income from investment securities decreased nine percent compared to 2009 due to a 68 bp decrease in the weighted-average yield and a four percent decline in average balances.  

Average interest-bearing core deposits increased $4.0 billion, or eight percent, compared to 2009, primarily due to increased interest checking, savings, money market and foreign office deposits, partially offset by a decline in other time deposits. The cost of interest-bearing core deposits was 0.83% in 2010; a decrease of 45 bp from 2009. The decrease is a result of a mix shift to lower cost core deposits and a decrease in rates on average time deposits of 71 bp compared to 2009.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Interest expense on wholesale funding decreased 35% compared to the prior year due to a 34% decrease in average balances and a 45 bp decrease in average rates. In 2010, wholesale funding represented 25% of interest-bearing liabilities, down from 35% in 2009. Impacting this change was a decrease of $4.8 billion in average other short term borrowings due to the repayment of Term Auction Facility funds and FHLB advances which had an average balance of 

 $3.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, in 2009. In addition, average certificates of deposit over $100,000 decreased $4.3 billion from 2009 due to maturities throughout 2010. The decreased reliance on wholesale funding in 2010 was a result of the growth of core deposits and a decline in average interest earning assets. For more information on the Bancorps interest rate risk management, including estimated earnings sensitivity to changes in market interest rates, see the Market Risk Management section of MD&A.

Provision for Loan and Lease Losses  

The Bancorp provides as an expense an amount for probable loan and lease losses within the loan and lease portfolio that is based on factors previously discussed in the Critical Accounting Policies section. The provision is recorded to bring the ALLL to a level deemed appropriate by the Bancorp to cover losses inherent in the portfolio. Actual credit losses on loans and leases are charged against the ALLL. The amount of loans actually removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets is referred to as charge-offs. Net charge-offs include current period charge-offs less recoveries on previously charged-off loans and leases.  

The provision for loan and lease losses decreased to $1.5 billion in 2010 compared to $3.5 billion in 2009. The decrease 

 in provision expense from the prior year was due to decreases in nonperforming assets and delinquencies in commercial and consumer loans. In addition to these trends, signs of moderation in general economic conditions during 2010 further contributed to a decrease in expected loss rates. As of December 31, 2010, the ALLL as a percent of loans and leases decreased to 3.88%, from 4.88% at December 31, 2009.  

Refer to the Credit Risk Management section for more detailed information on the provision for loan and lease losses including an analysis of the loan portfolio composition, non-performing assets, net charge-offs, and other factors considered by the Bancorp in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and the ALLL.

Noninterest Income  

Total noninterest income decreased $2.1 billion, or 43%, in 2010 compared to 2009, due primarily to the Processing Business Sale in the second quarter of 2009 as well as decreases in service charges on deposits, corporate banking revenue and card and processing revenue, partially offset by strong growth in mortgage banking net revenue and investment advisory revenue. The components of noninterest income are shown in Table 7.  

Mortgage banking net revenue increased to $647 million in 2010 from $553 million in 2009. The components of mortgage banking net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are shown in Table 8.  

TABLE 8: COMPONENTS OF MORTGAGE BANKING NET REVENUE  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Origination fees and gains on loan sales increased $5 million compared to 2009 as higher margins on loans sold were largely offset by a decline in mortgage originations due to the homebuyer tax credit expiring in the second quarter of 2010, as well as tighter underwriting standards and declining home values. Mortgage originations were $20.3 billion in 2010 compared to $21.7 billion in 2009.  

 Mortgage net servicing revenue increased $89 million compared to 2009. Net servicing revenue is comprised of gross servicing fees and related servicing rights amortization as well as valuation adjustments on mortgage servicing rights and mark-to-market adjustments on both settled and outstanding free-standing derivative financial instruments. The increase in net servicing revenue was driven by an increase of $24 million in servicing fees due to an increase in residential mortgage loans serviced and a $9 million decrease in servicing rights amortization due to a decline in prepayments. The Bancorps total residential mortgage loans serviced at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was $63.2 billion and $58.5 billion, respectively, with $54.2 billion and $48.6 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage loans serviced for others. Also impacting the increase in net servicing revenue were improvements in net valuation adjustments on MSRs and MSR derivatives as gains on the Bancorps free-standing MSR derivatives exceeded impairment losses recorded against the hedged MSRs. This was a result of a widening spread between swap rates and primary and secondary market mortgage rates as swap rates declined more than primary and secondary market mortgage rates over the year, as well as a positive carry in the net MSR hedge position. These factors led to a net gain of $73 million on the net valuation adjustments on MSRs, compared to a net gain of $17 million in 2009. 

Servicing rights are deemed temporarily impaired when a borrowers loan rate is distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Temporary impairment on servicing rights is reversed when the prevailing rates return to a level commensurate with the borrowers loan rate. Further information on the valuation of MSRs can be found in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the valuation on the MSR portfolio. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the free-standing derivatives used to hedge the MSR portfolio.  

The Bancorp recognized a gain from MSR derivatives of $109 million, offset by a temporary impairment of $36 million, resulting in a net gain of $73 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Bancorp recognized a gain from MSR derivatives of $41 million, offset by a temporary impairment of $24 million, resulting in a net gain of $17 million. In addition to the derivative positions used to economically hedge the MSR portfolio, the Bancorp acquires various securities as a component of its non-qualifying hedging strategy. A gain on these non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights of $14 million and $57 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, was included in noninterest income within the Consolidated Statements of Income, but is shown separate from mortgage banking net revenue.  

Service charges on deposits decreased $58 million, or nine percent, to $574 million in 2010 compared to 2009. Consumer deposit revenue decreased $56 million from 2009 as the impact of Regulation E and new overdraft policies resulted in a decrease in overdraft occurrences. Regulation E is a Federal Reserve Board rule that prohibits financial institutions from charging customers fees for paying overdrafts on ATMs and one-time debit card transactions unless a customer consents to the overdraft service for those types of transactions. Regulation E became effective on July 1, 2010 for new accounts and August 15, 2010 for existing accounts.  

 Commercial deposit revenue was flat compared to 2009 as a two percent increase in service fees for treasury management services was largely offset by an increase in earnings credits paid on customer balances. Commercial customers receive earnings credits to offset the fees charged for banking services on their deposit accounts, such as account maintenance, lockbox, ACH transactions, wire transfers and other ancillary corporate treasury management services. Earning credits are based on the customers average balance in qualifying deposits multiplied by the crediting rate. Qualifying deposits include demand deposits and interest-bearing checking accounts. The Bancorp has a standard crediting rate that is adjusted as necessary based on competitive market conditions and changes in short-term interest rates. 

  32    Fifth Third Bancorp    

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Corporate banking revenue decreased $8 million, or two percent, in 2010, largely due to decreases in international income and lease remarketing fees, partially offset by growth in syndication and business lending fees. Foreign exchange derivative income of $63 million decreased 17% driven by volume declines. Loan syndication fees were $28 million in 2010, compared to $8 million in 2009.  

Investment advisory revenue increased $35 million, or 11%, from 2009 as the result of improved market performance and sales production that drove an increase in brokerage activity and assets under care. Brokerage fee income, which includes Fifth Third Securities income, increased $23 million in 2010 as investors migrated balances to stock and bond funds due to improved market performance, which increased commission-based transactions. As of December 31, 2010, the Bancorp had $266 billion in assets under care and managed $25 billion in assets for individuals, corporations and not-for-profit organizations.  

On June 30, 2009, the Bancorp completed the sale of a majority interest in its merchant acquiring and financial institutions processing businesses. The Processing Business Sale generated a pre-tax gain of $1.8 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax). As part of the transaction, the Bancorp retained certain debit and credit card interchange revenue and sold the financial institutions and merchant processing portions of the business, which historically comprised approximately 70% of total card and processing revenue. As a result of the sale, card and processing revenue decreased $299 million, or 49%, compared to 2009. Card issuer interchange, which was retained by the Bancorp, increased eight percent, to $284 million, compared to 2009 due to strong growth in debit and credit card transaction volumes.  

Other noninterest income decreased $73 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The components of other noninterest income are shown in Table 9. The decrease was primarily due a $244 million gain relating to the sale of the Bancorps Visa, Inc. Class B shares in 2009 and a $27 million decrease in revenue in 2010 related to the TSA entered into as part of the Processing Business Sale, partially offset by an increase of $196 million in BOLI income. The year ended December 31, 2010 includes a $152 million litigation settlement related to one of the Bancorps BOLI policies while 2009 includes $53 million in charges to record a reserve in connection with the intent to surrender one of the Bancorps BOLI policies as well as losses related to market value declines.  

Net securities gains totaled $47 million in 2010 compared to $10 million of net securities losses during 2009.  

Noninterest Expense  

Total noninterest expense remained relatively flat in 2010 compared to 2009 as increases in salaries, wages and incentives and the expense for representation and warranties were largely offset by a decrease in the provision for unfunded commitments and letters of credit, lower FDIC insurance and other taxes and a decrease in card and processing expense. The components of noninterest expense are shown in Table 10. Noninterest expense in 2010 included $49 million of expenses related to the TSA and $25 million in legal fees associated with the settlement of claims with the insurance carrier on one of the Bancorps BOLI policies Noninterest expense in 2009 included $76 million of expense related to the TSA and a $55 million FDIC special assessment charge, partially offset by a $73 million reduction in the Visa litigation reserve.  

TABLE 9: COMPONENTS OF OTHER NONINTEREST INCOME  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total personnel costs (salaries, wages and incentives plus employee benefits) increased $94 million, or six percent in 2010 compared to 2009 due primarily to increased base, variable and incentive compensation, partially offset by lower deferred compensation. Base and incentive compensation increased due primarily to investments in the sales force and expanded banking center hours during 2010. As of December 31, 2010, the Bancorp employed 21,613 employees, of which 6,742 were officers and 2,519 were part-time employees. Full-time equivalent employees totaled 20,838 as of December 31, 2010 compared to 20,998 as of December 31, 2009. The decrease in full-time equivalent employees is primarily due to the transfer of employees on January 1, 2010 from the Processing Business Sale, partially offset by an increase in the sales force in 2010.  

Card and processing expense includes third-party processing expenses, card management fees and other bankcard processing expenses. Card and processing expense decreased $85 million, or 44%, in 2010 compared to 2009 due to the Processing Business Sale in June of 2009.  

Total other noninterest expense increased $23 million in 2010 compared to 2009. The components of other noninterest expense are shown in Table 11. The increase from 2009 was primarily due to increased charges to representation and warranty reserves related to residential mortgage loans sold to third-parties, as well as higher impairment on affordable housing investments, higher marketing expense due to increased consumer marketing campaigns and an increase in professional services fees primarily due to legal expenses related to the settlement of one of the Bancorps BOLI policies. The increase in affordable housing investment impairment was due to an increase in the volume of investments. These impacts were partially offset by a decrease in the provision for unfunded commitments and letters of credit, lower FDIC insurance and other taxes and a decrease in 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

     Fifth Third Bancorp    33 

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 intangible asset amortization due to certain customer deposit intangibles from previous acquisitions being fully amortized. Additionally, the Bancorp recorded a $73 million reversal of the Visa litigation reserve in 2009. The expense for representation and warranties, which is included in losses and adjustments, totaled $110 million and $31 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively, with the increase resulting primarily from a higher volume of repurchase demands. The decrease in the provision for unfunded commitments was due to lower estimates of inherent losses resulting from a decrease in delinquent loans as general economic conditions began to show signs of moderation in 2010.  

The Bancorp incurred $242 million of expense for FDIC insurance and other taxes in 2010 compared to $269 million in 2009. Effective June 30, 2009, the FDIC imposed a special assessment on each insured depository institution calculated as 5 bp of total assets less Tier 1 capital which resulted in the Bancorp incurring a $55 million special assessment charge in the second quarter of 2009. Due to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC was required to redefine the deposit insurance assessment base, make changes to assessment rate methodology and implement new DIF dividend provisions. The FDIC adopted the final rule on February 7, 2011, that revises the risk-based assessment system for all large insured depository institutions. The Bancorp anticipates a decline in FDIC insurance for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to levels incurred for the year ended December 31, 2010.  

The efficiency ratio (noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income) was 60.7% and 46.9% for 2010 and 2009, respectively. The increase from 2009 was driven by the Processing Business Sale which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1.8 billion in 2009. Excluding the gain from the Processing Business Sale, the efficiency ratio was 60.0% for 2009. The Bancorp continues to focus on efficiency initiatives, as part of its core emphasis on operating leverage and on expense control.  

Applicable Income Taxes  

The Bancorps income (loss) before income taxes, applicable income tax expense (benefit) and effective tax rate for each of the periods indicated are shown in Table 12. Applicable income tax expense for all periods includes the benefit from 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

tax-exempt income, tax-advantaged investments and general business tax credits, partially offset by the effect of nondeductible expenses. The effective tax rate for the tax year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily impacted by $133 million in tax credits, a $26 million tax benefit resulting from the settlement of certain uncertain tax positions with the IRS and $25 million of non-cash charges relating to previously recognized tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation that will not be realized. The effective tax rate for the tax year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily impacted by $112 million in tax credits, a $106 million tax benefit related to the decision to surrender one of the Bancorps BOLI policies and the determination that losses on the policy recorded in prior periods are now tax deductible, and a $55 million reduction in income tax expense related to the Bancorps leveraged lease litigation settlement with the IRS. See Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on income taxes.

BUSINESS SEGMENT REVIEW  

At December 31, 2010, the Bancorp reports on four business segments: Commercial Banking, Branch Banking, Consumer Lending and Investment Advisors. Additional detailed financial information on each business segment is included in Note 31 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Results of the Bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Bancorp; therefore, the financial results of the Bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions. The Bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as management accounting practices are improved and businesses change.  

On June 30, 2009, the Bancorp completed the Processing Business Sale, which represented the sale of a majority interest in the Bancorps merchant acquiring and financial institutions processing businesses. Financial data for the merchant acquiring and financial institutions processing businesses was originally reported in the former Processing Solutions segment through June 30, 2009. As a result of the sale, the Bancorp no longer presents Processing Solutions as a segment and therefore, historical financial information for the merchant acquiring and financial institutions processing businesses has been reclassified under General Corporate and Other for all periods presented. Interchange revenue previously recorded in the Processing Solutions segment and associated with cards currently included in Branch Banking is now included in the Branch Banking segment for all periods presented. Additionally, the Bancorp retained its retail credit card and commercial multi-card service businesses, which were also originally reported in the former Processing Solutions segment through June 30, 2009, and are now included in the Consumer Lending and Commercial Banking segments, respectively, for all periods presented. Revenue from the remaining ownership interest in the Processing Business is recorded in General Corporate and Other as noninterest income.  

The Bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level by employing a FTP methodology. This methodology insulates the business segments from interest rate volatility, enabling them to focus on serving customers through loan originations and deposit taking. The FTP system assigns charge rates and credit rates to classes of assets and 

 liabilities, respectively, based on expected duration and the LIBOR swap curve. Matching duration allocates interest income and interest expense to each segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from interest rate risk. In a rising rate environment, the Bancorp benefits from the widening spread between deposit costs and wholesale funding costs. However, the Bancorps FTP system credits this benefit to deposit-providing businesses, such as Branch Banking and Investment Advisors, on a duration-adjusted basis. The net impact of the FTP methodology is captured in General Corporate and Other.  

The business segments are charged provision expense based on the actual net charge-offs experienced by the loans owned by each segment. Provision expense attributable to loan growth and changes in factors in the ALLL are captured in General Corporate and Other. The financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses. Even with these allocations, the financial results are not necessarily indicative of the business segments financial condition and results of operations as if they existed as independent entities. Additionally, the business segments form synergies by taking advantage of cross-sell opportunities and when funding operations, by accessing the capital markets as a collective unit. Net income (loss) by business segment is summarized in the following table.

Commercial Banking  

Commercial Banking offers banking, cash management and financial services to large and middle-market businesses and government and professional customers. In addition to the traditional lending and depository offerings, Commercial Banking products and services include global cash management, foreign exchange and international trade finance, derivatives and capital markets services, asset-based lending, real estate finance, public finance, commercial leasing and syndicated finance. The following table contains selected financial data for the Commercial Banking segment.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Includes FTE adjustments of $14 for 2010, $13 for 2009 and $15 for 2008  

Comparison of 2010 with 2009  

Commercial Banking realized net income of $165 million in 2010 compared to a net loss of $120 million in 2009. This improvement was primarily due to an increase in net interest income and a decrease in provision for loan and lease losses partially offset by growth in salaries, incentives and benefits. Net interest income increased $162 million, or 12%, primarily due to a mix shift from higher cost term deposits to lower cost deposit products which resulted in a decrease to interest expense of 34% during 2010. This improvement was partially offset by the negative impact to net interest income of a decrease in average commercial loans during 2010 and a decrease of $35 million in the accretion of discounts on loans associated with the acquisition of First Charter in 2008.  

Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $201 million, or 15%, from 2009. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases decreased from 329 bp in 2009 to 302 bp in 2010. These decreases are primarily due to actions taken by the Bancorp to address problem loans which resulted in significant net charge-offs recorded in 2008 and 2009, as well as the impact of loss mitigation activities such as suspending home builder and developer lending and non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and tighter underwriting standards across commercial loan product offerings.  

 Noninterest income increased $26 million, or four percent, from 2009 primarily as a result of $24 million increase in gains on private equity investments, included in other noninterest income, and a $5 million increase in card and 

 processing revenue due to an increase in commercial credit card activity, partially offset by a $7 million decrease in corporate banking revenue. Corporate banking revenue decreased from the prior year primarily as a result of a $6 million decrease in fees on letters of credit.  

Noninterest expense was flat compared to 2009 due to an increase in salaries, incentives and benefits offset by a decrease in other noninterest expense. Salaries, incentives and benefits increased $33 million, or 15%, due to compensation related to improved performance in the segment and an increase in headcount during 2010. Loan and lease expense decreased $32 million, or four percent, as a result of lower loan demand during 2010, a decrease in collection related expenses and a decrease in FDIC expenses due to a special assessment in the second quarter of 2009.  

Average commercial loans and leases decreased $3.0 billion, or seven percent, compared to the prior year due to decreases across all commercial loan categories. Commercial construction loans decreased $1.5 billion, commercial and industrial loans decreased $655 million, commercial mortgage loans decreased $631 million and commercial leases decreased $209 million. These decreases were the result of lower customer demand for new originations, lower utilization rates on corporate lines and tighter underwriting standards applied to both new commercial loan originations and renewals. These impacts were partially offset by the consolidation of $724 million of commercial and industrial loans on January 1, 2010, which had a remaining balance of $372 million at December 31, 2010.  

Average core deposits increased $5.8 billion, or 32%, compared to 2009 due to the migration of higher priced certificates of deposit into transaction accounts, as well as the impact of historically low interest rates and excess customer liquidity.  

Comparison of 2009 with 2008  

Commercial Banking reported a net loss of $120 million in 2009 compared to a net loss of $733 million in 2008. This improvement was due to a $750 million goodwill impairment charge taken in 2008 and a $504 million decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses in 2009, partially offset by a decrease in net interest income of $184 million. The decrease in net interest income compared to 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in the accretion of loan discounts on acquired loans and deposits which contributed $204 million to net interest income in 2008 compared to $60 million in 2009. Average commercial loans and leases decreased $1.9 billion, or four percent, due to lower utilization rates on corporate lines, net charge-offs and tighter lending standards implemented in the second half of 2008 and continued throughout 2009.  

Provision expense decreased from $1.9 billion in 2008 to $1.4 billion in 2009. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases decreased to 329 bp from 432 bp in 2008 due primarily to $800 million in net charge-offs in 2008 resulting from the sale or transfer to held-for-sale of $1.3 billion in commercial and industrial loans and commercial mortgage loans in the fourth quarter of 2008.  

Noninterest income decreased $69 million compared to 2008 due to a decrease in corporate banking revenue of $48 million and a $31 million decline in other noninterest income, partially offset by a $10 million increase in service charges on deposits.  

 Noninterest expense decreased $679 million compared to 2008 primarily due to goodwill impairment of $750 million in 2008. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense increased $71 million due to increases in FDIC and loan and leases expenses.

Branch Banking  

Branch Banking provides a full range of deposit and loan and lease products to individuals and small businesses through 1,312 full-service banking centers. Branch Banking offers depository and loan products, such as checking and savings accounts, home equity loans and lines of credit, credit cards and loans for automobiles and other personal financing needs, as well as products designed to meet the specific needs of small businesses, including cash management services. The following table contains selected financial data for the Branch Banking segment.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Comparison of 2010 with 2009  

Net income decreased $123 million, or 38%, compared to 2009 driven by an increase in noninterest expense and a decrease in net interest income partially offset by a decrease in provision for loan and lease losses. Net interest income decreased $58 million, or four percent, compared to 2009 as the impact of lower loan balances more than offset a favorable shift in the segments deposit mix towards lower cost transaction deposits.  

Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $43 million, or seven percent, from 2009. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases decreased from 317 bp in 2009 to 305 bp in 2010 as a result of a 36 bp decrease in consumer net charge-offs as a percent of average consumer loans partially offset by a 52 bp increase in commercial net charge-offs as a percent of average commercial loans. The decrease in consumer net charge-offs was primarily the result of a decrease in delinquencies, tighter underwriting standards and signs of improvement in economic conditions during 2010. The increase in commercial net charge-offs was primarily due to $24 million of charge-offs taken on $60 million of commercial loans which were sold or moved to held for sale during the third quarter of 2010.  

 Noninterest income decreased $5 million, or one percent, from 2009 as decreases in service charges on deposits and other noninterest income were partially offset by increases in card and processing revenue and investment advisory revenue. Service charges on deposits decreased $59 million, or 14%, compared to 2009 as a result of new regulations in 2010 that decreased income on overdrafts. Card and processing revenue increased $39 million, or 15%, from 2009 primarily due to an increase in debit and credit card transactions that resulted in a 

13% increase in both credit and debit card interchange revenue. Investment advisory revenue increased $22 million, or 26%, compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in retail brokerage transactions. Other noninterest income decreased $7 million, or six percent, primarily due to the CARD Act of 2009, which resulted in the reduction of certain credit card fees.  

Noninterest expense increased $169 million, or 12%, from 2009 due to increases in each category. Salaries, incentives and benefits increased $50 million, or 10%, from the prior year due primarily to additional branch personnel related to expanded branch hours of operation and greater incentive accruals attributable to success in opening new deposit and brokerage accounts. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $6 million, or three percent, as a result of increases to rent expenses during 2010. Card and processing expense increased $34 million, or 50%, from 2009 due to increased costs associated with an increase in credit and debit card transaction volumes during 2010. Other noninterest expense increased $79 million, or 14%, due to increases in loan and lease expense, marketing expense and other allocated shared service expenses.  

Average consumer loans decreased $152 million, or one percent, and average commercial loans decreased $520 million, or 10%. The decrease in average consumer loans was the result of a $311 million decrease in home equity loans due to a decrease in demand and tighter underwriting standards that limited allowable loan to value ratios, partially offset by a $254 million increase in residential mortgage loans due to managements decision to retain certain residential mortgage loans in portfolio upon origination. The decrease in average commercial loans was due to lower customer demand for new originations, lower utilization rates on corporate lines and tighter underwriting standards applied to both new commercial loan originations and renewals.  

Average core deposits were flat compared to 2009 as runoff of higher priced consumer certificates of deposit, included in other time deposits, was replaced with growth in transaction accounts due to excess customer liquidity and low interest rates.  

Comparison of 2009 with 2008  

Net income decreased $308 million, or 49%, in 2009 compared to 2008 driven by decreases in net interest income and service fees combined with a higher provision for loan and lease losses. Net interest income decreased nine percent compared to 2008 due to a $27 million decline in the accretion of discounts on acquired loans and deposits combined with an increase in interest expense due to higher average balances in other time deposits.  

Net charge-offs as a percent of average loan and leases increased to 317 bp in 2009, from 194 bp in 2008. Net charge-offs increased compared to 2008 as the segment experienced higher charge-offs on home equity lines and loans, commercial loans and credit cards reflecting borrower stress and a decrease in home values primarily within the Bancorps footprint.  

Noninterest income was relatively flat compared to 2008 as decreases in deposit fees and retail service fees, included in other noninterest income, were offset by an increase in card and processing revenue.  

Noninterest expense increased $80 million, or six percent, compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in FDIC related expenses of $86 million as a result of a special assessment charged in 2009 coupled with an increase in assessment rates.  

 Average loans and leases increased one percent compared to 2008 as a three percent growth in consumer loans was partially offset by a five percent decrease in commercial loans. In addition, credit card balances grew $211 million, or 14%. Average core deposits were up eight percent compared to 2008 primarily due to growth in short term consumer certificates.

Consumer Lending  

Consumer Lending includes the Bancorps mortgage, home equity, automobile and other indirect lending activities. Mortgage and home equity lending activities include the origination, retention and servicing of mortgage and home equity loans or lines of credit, sales and securitizations of those loans or pools of loans or lines of credit and all associated hedging activities. Other indirect lending activities include loans to consumers through mortgage brokers and automobile dealers. The following table contains selected financial data for the Consumer Lending segment.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Comparison of 2010 with 2009  

Consumer Lending reported a net loss of $40 million in 2010 compared to net income of $23 million in 2009 due to a decrease in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense partially offset by an increase in noninterest income. Net interest income decreased $76 million, or 15%, from 2009 primarily due to a decrease in yields on average interest earning assets, which includes the impact of a $21 million decrease in the accretion of discounts on loans associated with the acquisition of First Charter in 2008, partially offset by a decrease in funding costs during 2010.  

Provision for loan and lease losses increased $8 million, or one percent, from 2009. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases decreased from 313 bp in 2009 to 309 bp in 2010. The increase in provision for loan and lease losses from the prior year was the result of a 23% increase in net charge-offs on residential mortgage loans primarily due to $123 million in charge-offs taken on $228 million of portfolio loans which were sold during the third quarter of 2010. Automobile loan net charge-offs decreased $44 million compared to 2009 as a result of tighter underwriting standards implemented in 2008, maturation of the automobile portfolio and higher resale values on automobiles sold at auction. Home equity net charge-offs decreased $24 million from 2009 due to run off of brokered home equity loans, the origination of which were discontinued in 2007.  

Noninterest income increased $35 million, or six percent, as the result of an increase in mortgage banking net revenue partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest income. Mortgage banking net revenue increased $93 million, or 18%, from 2009 primarily due to an $89 million increase in net servicing revenue. The increase in net servicing revenue was driven by a $56 million increase in net valuation adjustments on MSRs and MSR derivatives and a $24 million increase in servicing fees. Residential mortgage loans serviced for others at December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $54.2 billion and $48.6 billion, respectively. Other noninterest income decreased $58 million, or 57%, primarily due to decreases in securities gains related to mortgage servicing rights hedging activities and an increase in bankcard rewards program costs recognized within fee income. 

Noninterest expense increased $48 million, or nine percent, due to increases in salaries, incentives and benefits and other noninterest expense. Salaries, incentives and benefits increased $13 million, or seven percent, from 2009 due to the continued high levels of mortgage loan originations in 2010. Other noninterest expense increased $35 million, or 11%, from 2009 primarily as a result of a $48 million increase in the representation and warranty reserve partially offset by a $13 million decrease in loan and lease expense.  

Average consumer loans were flat compared to 2009 as a $1.7 billion increase in automobile loans was offset by decreases in all other consumer loan and lease products. Average residential mortgage loans decreased $1.3 billion from 2009 due to a decrease in origination activity during the first half of 2010. Average home equity loans decreased $144 million from 2009 due to the previously mentioned run off of brokered home equity loans. The increase in automobile loans was due to a change in U.S. GAAP that required the Bancorp to consolidate certain automobile loans on January 1, 2010 and a strategic focus to increase automobile lending during 2010 through consistent and competitive pricing, enhanced customer service with our dealership network and disciplined sales execution. The automobile loans consolidated due to the change in U.S. GAAP had an average balance of $920 million during 2010. Average consumer leases decreased $245 million due to run off of consumer leases which were discontinued in the fourth quarter of 2008.  

Comparison of 2009 with 2008  

Consumer Lending reported net income of $23 million in 2009 compared to a net loss of $148 million in 2008 primarily due to a goodwill impairment charge of $215 million taken in 2008. In addition, increases in net interest income and mortgage banking net revenue in 2009 more than offset the growth in provision for loan and lease losses.  

Net interest income increased $13 million in 2009 primarily due to a decrease in funding costs driven by low interest rates throughout 2009 partially offset by a decrease of $17 million on the accretion of discounts on loans and deposits associated with the acquisition of First Charter in 2008.  

Mortgage banking net revenue increased $342 million due to an increase in residential mortgage originations from $11.2 billion in 2008 to $20.7 billion in 2009 due to lower interest rates and government incentive programs offered to home buyers as well as higher sales margins on sold loans. The decrease in other noninterest income to $101 million in 2009 is attributable to decreases in securities gains related to mortgage servicing rights hedging activities.  

The increase in salaries, incentives and benefits compared to 2008 was driven by employee costs that were necessary to manage the increase in residential mortgage originations. The $56 million increase in other noninterest expense compared to 2008 is attributed to a $20 million increase in loan processing costs as a result of increased mortgage originations and $36 million in other credit related expenses and an increase in FDIC insurance expenses.  

Average residential mortgage loans and average automobile loans remained relatively flat compared to 2008. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loan and leases increased from 223 bp in 2008 to 313 bp in 2009.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Comparison of 2010 with 2009  

Net income decreased $24 million, or 45%, compared to 2009 as a decrease in net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense were partially offset by a decrease in provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in investment advisory revenue. Net interest income decreased $19 million, or 12%, from 2009 due to a decrease in average loans and leases partially offset by an increase in the yield on interest earning assets.  

Provision for loan and lease losses decreased $13 million, or 23%, from 2009. Net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases decreased from 183 bp in 2009 to 171 bp in 2010 reflecting moderation of general economic conditions during 2010.  

Noninterest income increased $20 million, or six percent, compared to 2009 due to an increase in investment advisory revenue partially offset by a decrease in other noninterest income. Investment advisory revenue increased $31 million, 

 or 10%, compared to 2009 due to increases in securities and broker income, private client service income and institutional income. Securities and broker income increased $18 million, or 17%, from 2009 due to continued expansion of the sales force and effective sales management, resulting in strong net asset and account growth. Private client service income increased $11 million, or eight percent, and institutional income increased $5 million, or seven percent, from 2009 due to increases in the market value of managed assets and an increase in transaction activity. Assets under care increased from $182 billion at December 31, 2009 to $266 billion at December 31, 2010 and managed assets increased from $24 billion at December 31, 2009 to $25 billion at December 31, 2010.  

Noninterest expense increased $51 million, or 14%, compared to 2009 due to an increase in salaries, incentives and benefits and other noninterest expense. Salaries, incentives and benefits increased $16 million, or 11%, primarily due to the expansion of the sales force and compensation related to improved performance in investment advisory revenue related fees. Other noninterest expense increased $35 million, or 16%, primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with the revenue sharing agreement between Investment Advisors and Branch Banking.  

Average loans and leases decreased $538 million, or 17%, from 2009 primarily due to a $418 million decrease in commercial loans as a result of a decrease in demand and decrease in line utilization rates among the Bancorps high net worth customers due to excess liquidity. Average core deposits increased $958 million, or 19%, compared to 2009 primarily due to growth in interest checking and foreign deposits as customers have opted to maintain excess funds in liquid transaction accounts as rates remained near historic lows.  

Comparison of 2009 with 2008  

Net income decreased $45 million in 2009, or 46%, compared to 2008 as decreases in net interest income and investment advisory revenue were only partially offset by lower salaries and benefit expenses.  

Noninterest income decreased $50 million in 2009 compared to 2008, as investment advisory revenue decreased $39 million, with private client services income declining $14 million and institutional income declining $13 million, driven by lower asset values on assets managed compared to 2008. Also included within investment advisory revenue is securities and brokerage income, which declined $10 million, or nine percent, compared to 2008, reflecting a decline in transaction-based revenue as well as the continued shift in assets from equity products to lower yielding money market funds due to market volatility through much of 2009.

General Corporate and Other  

General Corporate and Other includes the unallocated portion of the investment securities portfolio, securities gains and losses, certain non-core deposit funding, unassigned equity, provision expense in excess of net charge-offs or income from the reduction of ALLL, the payment of preferred stock dividends, historical financial information for the merchant acquiring and financial institutions processing businesses and certain support activities and other items not attributed to the business segments.  

Comparison of 2010 with 2009  

The results for 2010 were impacted by $789 million in income due to a reduction in the ALLL during 2010 compared to $967 million of provision expense recorded in excess of net charge-offs during 2009. The decrease in provision expense was due to a decrease in nonperforming assets and improvement in credit trends as general economic conditions began to show signs of moderation. The 2010 results were also impacted by $152 million of noninterest income recognized from the settlement of litigation associated with one of the Bancorps BOLI policies and $25 million of noninterest expense from related legal fees associated with the settlement. The results for 2009 were primarily impacted by a $1.8 billion pre-tax gain ($1.1 billion after tax) resulting from the Processing Business Sale in the second quarter of 2009. Results for 2009 also included a $244 million gain on the sale of the Bancorps Visa Inc., Class B shares and a $73 million benefit from the reversal of the Visa litigation reserve, an $18 million benefit in noninterest income due to mark-to-market adjustments on 

 warrants and put options related to the Processing Business Sale and a $106 million tax benefit as a result of the Bancorps decision to surrender one of its BOLI policies. These benefits were partially offset by a $54 million BOLI charge reflecting reserves recorded in the connection with the intent to surrender the policy. Additionally, the Bancorp recorded dividends on preferred stock of $226 million during 2009 compared to $250 million during 2010.  

Comparison of 2009 with 2008  

The results for 2009 were primarily impacted by the previously mentioned Processing Business Sale, gain on the sale of the Bancorps Visa Inc., Class B shares and benefit from the reversal of the Visa litigation reserve, mark-to-market adjustments on warrants and put options related to the Processing Business Sale, and the tax benefit as a result of the Bancorps decision to surrender one of its BOLI policies, partially offset by charges reflecting reserves recorded in the connection with the intent to surrender the policy. The results for 2008 were impacted by $273 million in income related to the redemption of a portion of Fifth Thirds ownership interest in Visa, $99 million in net reductions to noninterest expense to reflect the reversal of a portion of the litigation reserve related to the Bancorps indemnification of Visa, $229 million after-tax impact of charges relating to certain leveraged leases, and $215 million in charges related to reduction in the cash surrender value of one of the Bancorps BOLI policies. Provision expense in excess of net charge-offs decreased from $1.9 billion in 2008 to $967 million in 2009. Dividends on preferred stock increased from $67 million in 2008 to $226 million in 2009.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

FOURTH QUARTER REVIEW  

The Bancorps 2010 fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders was $270 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $175 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2010 and a net loss available to common shareholders of $160 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2010 earnings included the impact of a $17 million charge related to the early extinguishment of $1.0 billion in FHLB borrowings as well as $21 million in net investment securities gains. Third quarter 2010 results included a $127 million benefit, net of expenses, from the settlement of litigation associated with one of the Bancorps BOLI policies. Fourth quarter 2009 earnings were impacted by the benefit of a $20 million pre-tax, mark-to-market adjustment on warrants related to the Processing Business Sale, offset by a $22 million pre-tax litigation reserve for litigation associated with a bank card association membership. Provision expense was $166 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, down from $457 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $776 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Both the sequential decrease and the decline from the fourth quarter of 2009 reflect improved credit trends, as evidenced by a decrease in net charge-offs and improvements in nonperforming assets and delinquent loans. The allowance to loan and lease ratio was 3.88% as of December 31, 2010, compared to 4.20% as of September 30, 2010 and 4.88% as of December 31, 2009.  

Fourth quarter 2010 net interest income of $919 million increased $3 million from the third quarter of 2010 and increased $37 million from the same period a year ago. Net interest income was affected by the loan and deposit discount accretion related to the acquisition of First Charter in the second quarter of 2008, which resulted in increases to net interest income of $15 million in the fourth quarter 2010, $14 million in the third quarter 2010 and $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Excluding these benefits, net interest income increased $2 million from the third quarter of 2010 and increased $45 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase from the fourth quarter of 2009 was driven by a 20 bp increase in the net interest margin, largely the result of a mix shift from higher cost term deposits to lower cost deposit products throughout 2010.  

Noninterest income decreased $171 million compared to the third quarter of 2010 and increased $5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. The sequential decline was driven by a $152 million benefit from the settlement of litigation related to one of the Bancorps BOLI policies in the third quarter of 2010, as well as a 36% decrease in mortgage banking net revenue, partially offset by an increase in corporate banking revenue. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, increases in corporate banking revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, investment advisory revenue and card and processing revenue were largely offset by a decrease in service charges on deposits and a $28 million decline in TSA revenue related to the Processing Business Sale. The fourth quarter of 2010 included a benefit of $3 million in mark-to-market adjustments on warrants and put options related to the Processing Business Sale, compared to a negative $5 million adjustment in the third quarter of 2010 and a $20 million benefit in the fourth quarter of 2009.  

Mortgage banking net revenue was $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $232 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $132 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter originations were $7.4 billion, compared to $5.6 billion in the previous quarter and $4.8 billion in the same quarter last year. These originations resulted in gains on mortgage loan sales activity of $158 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $173 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Gain on sale margins declined compared to record levels in the third quarter of 2010 due to rising mortgage interest rates in the 

 fourth quarter of 2010 but increased compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 due to declining mortgage interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Also impacting mortgage banking net revenue was net valuation adjustments on MSRs and MSR derivatives. In the fourth quarter of 2010, losses on the Bancorps free-standing MSR derivatives exceeded impairment reversal recorded against the hedged MSRs. By comparison, in both the third quarter of 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2009, gains on the MSR derivatives exceeded impairment losses recognized against the hedged MSRs. These factors led to a net loss of $20 million on the net valuation adjustments on MSRs in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to net gains of $46 million and $9 million in the third quarter of 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2009, respectively. A net gain on non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights of $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 was included in noninterest income within the Consolidated Statements of Income, but shown separate from mortgage banking net revenue. Net gains on non-qualifying hedges on mortgage servicing rights were immaterial in both the third quarter of 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2009.  

Service charges on deposits of $140 million decreased three percent sequentially and decreased 12% compared to the fourth quarter of 2009. Retail service charges declined nine percent from the third quarter of 2010 and 26% from a year ago, largely driven by the impact of Regulation E. Commercial service charges increased three percent sequentially and two percent from the same quarter last year due to an increase in fees for treasury management services.  

Corporate banking revenue of $103 million increased $17 million, or 21%, from the previous quarter and increased $14 million, or 16%, from the fourth quarter of 2009. The sequential increase was driven primarily by higher loan syndication fee revenue and lease remarketing fees, as well as growth in business lending fees and foreign exchange revenue due primarily to higher loan volumes. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, increased loan syndication and lease remarketing fees, as well as revenue from interest rate derivative sales and business lending fees, more than offset a decline in institutional sales.  

Investment advisory revenue of $93 million increased four percent sequentially and eight percent from the fourth quarter of 2009. The sequential growth was driven by higher private client service revenue, institutional trust revenue and brokerage fees due to market value increases and improved sales production resulting in improved net asset and account growth. Including the previously mentioned impacts, the increase from the fourth quarter of 2009 also reflected an overall increase in equity and bond market values.  

Card and processing revenue of $81 million increased five percent compared to the third quarter of 2010 and increased seven percent from the fourth quarter of 2009. Both increases were driven by higher transaction volumes.  

The net gain on investment securities was $21 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to a net gain of $4 million in the third quarter of 2010 and a net gain of $2 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  

 Noninterest expense of $987 million increased $8 million sequentially and increased $20 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2010 results included $17 million of expenses related to the early termination of $1.0 billion in FHLB borrowings as well as $11 million of expenses related to the TSA. Third quarter 2010 results included $25 million in legal expenses associated with the settlement of litigation associated with one of the Bancorps BOLI policies and $13 million of expenses related to the TSA, while fourth quarter 2009 included a $22 million reserve established for litigation

 associated with bank card memberships and $39 million of expenses related to the TSA. Excluding these items, noninterest expense increased $16 million sequentially and $25 million from the fourth quarter of 2009 driven by higher compensation expense due to sales force expansion, partially offset by lower credit-related expenses. Expenses incurred related to problem assets totaled $53 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $67 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $73 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  

Net charge-offs totaled $356 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $956 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $708 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Third quarter 2010 net charge-offs included $510 million related to the sale or transfer of loans to held-for-sale. Excluding these losses, net charge-offs declined $90 million from the third quarter of 2010. The decreases in net charge-offs from both periods reflects continued improvement in the credit quality of portfolio loans. Commercial net charge-offs were $173 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $627 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $468 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Third quarter 2010 net charge-offs include $387 million from the transfer of commercial loans to held-for-sale. Excluding these losses, commercial net charge-offs declined $67 million from the third quarter of 2010. Consumer net charge-offs were $183 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to $329 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $240 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Third quarter 2010 net charge-offs include $123 million in net charge-offs on the sale of portfolio residential mortgage loans during the quarter. Excluding these losses, consumer net charge-offs decreased $23 million from the third quarter of 2010. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $166 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to $457 million in the third quarter of 2010 and $776 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease from each quarter was primarily due to a decline in delinquent loans and net charge-offs.  

COMPARISON OF THE YEAR ENDED 2009 WITH 2008  

Net income available to common shareholders for the year ended 2009 was $511 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, compared to a net loss available to common shareholders of $2.2 billion, or $3.91 per diluted share, in 2008. Overall, a $1.8 billion pre-tax gain on the Processing Business Sale and $244 million of noninterest income on the sale of the Bancorps Visa, Inc. Class B shares as well as an increase in mortgage banking net revenue and a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses of $1.0 billion compared to 2008, were partially offset by decreases in net interest income and card and processing revenue. In addition, the Bancorp recorded a $965 million goodwill impairment charge in 2008. While the Bancorp continued to be affected by rising unemployment rates, weakened housing markets, particularly in the upper Midwest and Florida, and a challenging credit environment, credit trends began to show signs of stabilization in late 2009, which led to the decrease in provision expense. The 2008 goodwill impairment charge reflected a decline in estimated fair values of two of the Bancorps business reporting units below their carrying values and the determination that the implied fair values of the reporting units were less than their carrying values. 

Net interest income decreased five percent compared to 2008. This was primarily due to a 21 bp decline in the net interest rate spread, as well as a decrease in the benefit from the accretion of purchase accounting adjustments related to the 2008 acquisition of First Charter, which added $136 million to net interest income in 2009 compared to $358 million in 2008. Net interest margin decreased to 3.32% in 2009 from 3.54% in 2008.  

Noninterest income increased 62% compared to 2008. This was driven primarily by the Processing Business Sale in the second quarter of 2009, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $1.8 billion, as well as a $244 million gain related to the sale of the Bancorps Visa, Inc. Class B shares. Mortgage banking net revenue increased $354 million as a result of strong growth in originations, which were up 89% to $21.7 billion in 2009. Card and processing revenue decreased 33% compared to 2008 due to the Processing Business Sale in the second quarter of 2009. Corporate banking revenue decreased 10% largely due to a lower volume of interest rate derivatives sales and foreign exchange revenue, partially offset by growth in institutional sales and business lending fees.  

Noninterest expense decreased $738 million, or 16% compared to 2008. Noninterest expense in 2008 included the previously mentioned goodwill impairment charge of $965 million. Excluding this charge, noninterest expense increased $227 million due primarily to an increase of $196 million of FDIC insurance and other taxes as the result of an increase in deposit insurance and participation in the TLGP, as well as increased loan related expenses from higher mortgage origination volume and expenses incurred from the management of problem assets.  

In 2009, net charge-offs as a percent of average loans and leases remained relatively steady at 320 bp, compared to 323 bp in 2008. This was impacted by a decrease of $446 million in commercial loan net charge-offs due primarily to net charge-offs of $800 million on $1.3 billion on loans moved to held-for-sale or sold in the fourth quarter of 2008. These actions were taken to address areas of the loan portfolio exhibiting the most significant credit deterioration. In addition, residential mortgage net charge-offs increased to $357 million in 2009, compared to $243 million in 2008, reflecting increased foreclosure rates in the Bancorps key lending markets. At December 31, 2009, nonperforming assets as a percent of loans and leases increased to 4.22% from 2.38% at December 31, 2008. The Bancorp increased its allowance for loan and lease losses as percent of loans and leases from 3.31% as of December 31, 2008 to 4.88% as of December 31, 2009.  

The Bancorp took a number of actions to strengthen its capital position in 2009. On June 4, 2009, the Bancorp completed an at-the-market offering resulting in the sale of $1 billion of its common shares at an average share price of $6.33. In addition, on June 17, 2009, the Bancorp completed its offer to exchange shares of its common stock and cash for shares of its Series G convertible preferred stock. As a result, the Bancorp recognized an increase in net income available to common shareholders of $35 million based upon the difference in carrying value of the Series G preferred shares and the fair value of the common shares and cash issued. See the Capital Management section of MD&A for further information on the Bancorps capital transactions.

BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS  

Loans and Leases  

The Bancorp classifies its loans and leases based upon the primary purpose of the loan. Table 18 summarizes end of period loans and leases, including loans held for sale, and Table 19 summarizes average total loans and leases, including loans held for sale.  

At December 31, 2010, total loans and leases, including loans held for sale, increased $861 million, or one percent, compared to December 31, 2009. The increase consisted of a $2.1 billion increase in consumer loans partially offset by a $1.3 billion decrease in commercial loans. In accordance with a change in U.S. GAAP, on January 1, 2010 the Bancorp consolidated certain commercial and industrial, automobile and home equity loans with remaining outstanding balances of $372 million, $648 million and $241 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010. Excluding the impact of this change in U.S. GAAP, total loans and leases were relatively flat compared to December 31, 2009. For further discussion on this change in U.S. GAAP, refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Total commercial loans and leases decreased $1.3 billion, or three percent, compared to December 31, 2009 primarily as the result of decreases in commercial construction loans and commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by an increase in commercial and industrial loans. Commercial construction loans decreased $1.8 billion, or 45%, from December 31, 2009 primarily due to managements strategy to suspend new lending on commercial non-owner occupied real estate beginning in 2008 and the outflow of completed construction projects that were transitioned to commercial mortgage loans. Despite the transition of commercial construction loans, commercial mortgage loans decreased $944 million, or eight percent, from December 31, 2009 due to tighter underwriting standards on commercial real estate loans in an overall effort to limit exposure to commercial real estate. Commercial and industrial loans increased $1.6 billion, or six percent, compared to December 31, 2009 as a result of the previously mentioned change in U.S. GAAP and an increase in new loan originations activity, primarily due to an increase in customer demand with continued growth in the manufacturing and healthcare industries. This increase was partially offset by an $856 million decrease in loans originally issued to FTPS in conjunction with the Processing Business Sale; FTPS refinanced the original $1.25 billion in loans into a larger syndicated loan structure in connection with an acquisition.  

Total consumer loans and leases increased $2.1 billion, or six percent, from December 31, 2009. This increase was primarily the result of increases in automobile loans and residential mortgage loans, partially offset by a decrease in home equity loans. Automobile loans increased $2.0 billion, or 22%, compared to December 31, 2009 primarily as a result of the previously mentioned impact on automobile loans due 

 to the change in U.S. GAAP and a strategic focus to increase automobile lending during 2010 through consistent and competitive pricing, enhanced customer service with our dealership network and disciplined sales execution. Residential mortgage loans increased $1.0 billion, or 10%, from December 31, 2009 as a result of a 51% increase in origination activity for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009 and managements decision in the third quarter of 2010 to retain certain mortgage loans primarily originated through the Bancorps retail branches. Home equity loans decreased $660 million, or five percent, from December 31, 2009 as tighter underwriting standards and a decrease in customer demand were partially offset by the previously mentioned impact on home equity loans due to the change in U.S. GAAP. Credit card loans decreased $94 million, or five percent, as a result of a decrease in new account origination activity throughout 2010. Other consumer loans and leases, primarily made up of student loans designated as held for sale and automobile leases, decreased $110 million, or 14%, due to a decline in new originations driven by tighter underwriting standards.  

Average commercial loans and leases decreased $3.9 billion, or eight percent, compared to 2009. The decrease in average commercial loans consisted of a decrease of $1.6 billion, or 34%, in average commercial construction loans, $1.2 billion, or four percent, in average commercial and industrial loans and $926 million, or seven percent, in average commercial mortgage loans. These decreases were driven by lower customer line utilization rates, lower demand for new loans and tighter underwriting standards on commercial real estate loans to manage risk, partially offset by the impact of the previously discussed change in U.S. GAAP. Commercial and industrial loans experienced an increase in origination activity primarily during the fourth quarter of 2010 which led to a higher period end balance at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009  

Average consumer loans and leases were relatively flat compared to 2009. An increase in average automobile loans of $1.6 billion, or 18%, was offset by decreases in average residential mortgage loans of $1.0 billion, or nine percent, and average home equity loans of $538 million, or four percent. The impact of the previously mentioned consolidation of automobile and home equity loans was largely offset by a decrease in customer demand and tighter underwriting standards. Residential mortgage originations in 2009 were higher than in 2010 resulting in a lower annual average; however volume of new originations during the fourth quarter of 2010 were greater than the fourth quarter of 2009 resulting in a higher period end balance at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009.

Investment Securities  

The Bancorp uses investment securities as a means of managing interest rate risk, providing liquidity support and providing collateral for pledging purposes. As of December 31, 2010, total investment securities were $16.1 billion compared to $18.9 billion at December 31, 2009. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Bancorps methodology for both classifying investment securities and managements evaluation of securities in an unrealized loss position for OTTI.  

At December 31, 2010, the Bancorps investment portfolio primarily consisted of AAA-rated agency mortgage-backed securities. In 2010, the Bancorp recognized $3 million of OTTI on its investment securities portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2009, OTTI was immaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2008, the Bancorp recognized OTTI charges of $67 million on FHLMC and FNMA preferred stock and $37 million on certain trust preferred securities. Upon a change in U.S. GAAP in 2009, the Bancorp concluded that the OTTI charges on these trust preferred securities were due to non-credit related factors and therefore, recognized an increase of $37 million to the investment balance and related unrealized losses.  

The Bancorp did not hold asset-backed securities backed by subprime mortgage loans in its investment portfolio as of, or for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Additionally, there was approximately $137 million of securities classified as below investment grade as of December 31, 2010, compared to $178 million as of December 31, 2009.  

As of December 31, 2010, available-for-sale securities on an amortized cost basis decreased $3.0 billion from December 31, 2009. The decrease included the impact of a change in U.S. GAAP that required the Bancorp to consolidate certain VIEs, resulting in the elimination of $805 million in commercial paper and $236 million of residual interests classified as available-for-sale securities on January 1, 2010. Further impacting the available-for-sale securities were 

 approximately $1.1 billion in sales and paydowns on agency mortgage-backed securities, primarily related to the FNMA and FHLMC delinquent loan buy-back programs in the second quarter of 2010, and managements decision not to fully reinvest cash flows in securities due to the low market rate environment. In addition, sales of $579 million of FNMA and FHLMC agency debentures, $151 million of commercial mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage obligations and $103 million of trust preferred securities as well as $150 million in paydowns on other asset-backed securities further drove the decline from December 31, 2009.  

At December 31, 2010, available-for-sale securities decreased to 15% of interest-earning assets, compared to 18% at December 31, 2009. This was due to a 17% decrease in the available-for-sale portfolio as discussed above, partially offset by the impact of a four percent decline in average interest earning assets. The estimated weighted-average life of the debt securities in the available-for-sale portfolio was 4.4 years at December 31, 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, the fixed-rate securities within the available-for-sale securities portfolio had a weighted-average yield of 4.24% compared to 4.48% at December 31, 2009.  

Information presented in Table 21 is on a weighted-average life basis, anticipating future prepayments. Yield information is presented on an FTE basis and is computed using historical cost balances. Maturity and yield calculations for the total available-for-sale portfolio exclude equity securities that have no stated yield or maturity. Market rates declined from 2009, which led to net unrealized gains on agency mortgage-backed securities of $403 million, compared to $323 million as of December 31, 2009. Total net unrealized gains on the available-for-sale securities portfolio were $495 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $334 million at December 31, 2009.

 (a) Taxable-equivalent yield adjustments included in the above table are 1.45%, 2.83%, 2.16%, 2.06% and 1.63% for securities with an average life of one year or less, 1-5 years, 5-10 years, greater than 10 years and in total, respectively.  

 (b) Other bonds, notes, and debentures consist of non-agency mortgage backed securities, certain other asset backed securities (primarily automobile and commercial loan backed securities) and corporate bond securities.  

 (c) Other securities consist of FHLB and FRB restricted stock holdings that are carried at par, FHLMC and FNMA preferred stock, certain mutual fund holdings and equity security holdings.  

Trading securities decreased from $355 million at December 31, 2009 to $294 million at December 31, 2010. The decrease was driven by the sale of VRDNs which were held by the Bancorp in its trading securities portfolio. These securities were purchased from the market during 2008 and 2009 through FTS who was also the remarketing agent. During the fourth quarter of 2009 and into 2010, the rates on these securities began to decline substantially, and as a result the Bancorp sold a majority of its VRDNs and replaced them with higher-yielding agency mortgage-backed securities 

 classified as available-for-sale. The Bancorp continued to sell the VRDNs throughout 2010, resulting in the decrease from December 31, 2009. For more information on the VRDNs, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Included in trading securities as of December 31, 2010 were $6 million of auction rate securities, which had an unrealized loss of $1 million. The Bancorp held $13 million of auction rate securities in its trading portfolio at December 31, 2009, which had an unrealized loss of $4 million.

TABLE 22: DEPOSITS  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

TABLE 23: AVERAGE DEPOSITS  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Deposits  

Deposit balances represent an important source of funding and revenue growth opportunity. The Bancorp continues to focus on core deposit growth in its retail and commercial franchises by improving customer satisfaction, building complete relationships and offering competitive rates. At December 31, 2010, core deposits represented 70% of the Bancorps asset funding base compared to 68% at December 31, 2009.  

Core deposits increased $765 million, or one percent, compared to 2009 due primarily to increases of $3.0 billion in savings and $2.0 billion in demand deposits which was primarily the result of excess customer liquidity. In addition, foreign office deposits increased $1.3 billion due to an increase in commercial customer deposits due to excess customer liquidity, and those customers opting to sweep additional funds into these accounts for the higher interest rates. These increases were partially offset by the continued run-off of higher priced certificates included in other time deposits, which declined $4.7 billion, or 38%, compared to December 31, 2009, as well as a decline in interest checking 

 due primarily to rate management actions on single product public funds accounts in the second half of 2010.  

Included in core deposits are foreign office deposits, which are Eurodollar sweep accounts for the Bancorps commercial customers. These accounts bear interest at rates slightly higher than money market accounts, but the Bancorp does not have to pay FDIC insurance nor pledge collateral. The Bancorp uses these deposits, as well as certificates of deposit $100,000 and over, as a method to fund earning asset growth. Certificates $100,000 and over at December 31, 2010 decreased $3.4 billion compared to December 31, 2009 as customers opted to maintain their balances in liquid accounts due to historically low interest rates.  

On an average basis, core deposits increased $6.9 billion, or 10%, due to increases in interest checking of $3.1 billion, demand deposits of $2.8 billion, savings deposits of $2.7 billion and foreign office deposits of $1.2 billion, partially offset by a decrease in other time deposits of $3.6 billion. This activity was the result of the migration of higher priced certificates included in other time deposits into transaction accounts, as well as the impact of historically low rates and excess customer liquidity.

Borrowings  

Total borrowings declined $693 million from December 31, 2009, as the result of a decrease in long-term debt partially offset by an increase in federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowings.  

Long-term debt at December 31, 2010 decreased $949 million, or nine percent, compared to December 31, 2009 primarily as the result of the repayment of $1.0 billion in FHLB advances during the fourth quarter of 2010 and the maturity of $800 million of long-term debt in the first quarter of 2010. These declines were partially offset by the impact of a change in U.S. GAAP which required the Bancorp to consolidate long-term debt on January 1, 2010 that had an outstanding balance of $692 million as of December 31, 2010.  

Average borrowings declined $5.2 billion from 2009, primarily as a result of repayment of term auction facility funds and FHLB advances throughout 2009 which contributed 

 $3.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, to average balances in 2009. These repayments were made possible by a decrease in loan demand combined with growth in deposits during 2009. See the Capital Management Section for additional information.  

Information on the average rates paid on borrowings is included within the Statements of Income Analysis. Additionally, refer to the Liquidity Risk Management section for a discussion on the role of borrowings in the Bancorps liquidity management.  

On January 25, 2011, the Bancorp issued $1.0 billion of senior notes to third party investors, bearing a fixed rate of interest of 3.625% per annum. The notes are unsecured, senior obligations of the Bancorp and mature on January 25, 2016. See Note 32 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement for further information on the debt issuance.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

RISK MANAGEMENT  

Managing risk is an essential component of successfully operating a financial services company. The Bancorps risk management approach includes processes for identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks. The ERM division, led by the Bancorps Chief Risk Officer, ensures the consistency and adequacy of the Bancorps risk management approach within the structure of the Bancorps affiliate operating model. In addition, the Internal Audit division provides an independent assessment of the Bancorps internal control structure and related systems and processes.  

The assumption of risk requires robust and active risk management practices that comprise an integrated and comprehensive set of activities, measures and strategies that apply to the entire organization. The Bancorp has established a Risk Appetite Framework that provides the foundations of corporate risk capacity, risk appetite and risk tolerances. The Bancorps risk capacity is represented by its available financial resources. Risk capacity sets an absolute limit on risk-assumption in the Bancorps annual and strategic plans. The Bancorps policy currently discounts its risk capacity by five percent to provide a buffer; as a result, the Bancorps risk appetite is limited by policy to 95% of its risk capacity.  

Economic capital is the amount of unencumbered financial resources necessary to support the Bancorps risks. The Bancorp measures economic capital under the assumption that it expects to maintain debt ratings at strong investment grade levels over time. The Bancorps capital policies require that the economic capital necessary in its business not exceed its risk capacity less the aforementioned buffer.  

Risk appetite is the aggregate amount of risk the Bancorp is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic and financial objectives. By establishing boundaries around risk taking and business decisions, and by incorporating the needs and goals of its shareholders, regulators, rating agencies and customers, the Bancorps risk appetite is aligned with its priorities and goals. Risk tolerance is the maximum amount of risk applicable to each of the eight specific risk categories included in its Enterprise Risk Management Framework. This is expressed primarily in qualitative terms. The Bancorps risk appetite and risk tolerances are supported by risk targets and risk limits. Those limits are used to monitor the amount of risk assumed at a granular level.  

The risks faced by the Bancorp include, but are not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, regulatory compliance, legal, reputational and strategic. Each of these risks is managed through the Bancorps risk program. ERM includes the following key functions:  

       Enterprise Risk Management Programs is responsible for developing and overseeing the implementation of risk programs and reporting that facilitate a broad integrated view of risk. The department also leads the ongoing development of a strong risk management culture and the framework, policies and committees that support effective risk governance;  

       Commercial Credit Risk Management provides safety and soundness within an independent portfolio management framework that supports the Bancorps commercial loan growth strategies and underwriting practices, ensuring portfolio optimization and appropriate risk controls;  

       Risk Strategies and Reporting is responsible for quantitative analysis needed to support the commercial dual grading system, ALLL methodology and analytics needed to assess credit risk and develop mitigation strategies related to that risk. The department also 

       provides oversight, reporting and monitoring of commercial underwriting and credit administration processes. The Risk Strategies and Reporting department is also responsible for the economic capital program;  

       Consumer Credit Risk Management provides safety and soundness within an independent management framework that supports the Bancorps consumer loan growth strategies, ensuring portfolio optimization, appropriate risk controls and oversight, reporting, and monitoring of underwriting and credit administration processes;  

       Operational Risk Management works with affiliates and lines of business to maintain processes to monitor and manage all aspects of operational risk including ensuring consistency in application of operational risk programs and Sarbanes-Oxley compliance;  

       Bank Protection oversees and manages fraud prevention and detection and provides investigative and recovery services for the Bancorp;  

       Capital Markets Risk Management is responsible for instituting, monitoring, and reporting appropriate trading limits, monitoring liquidity, interest rate risk, and risk tolerances within Treasury, Mortgage, and Capital Markets groups and utilizing a value at risk model for Bancorp market risk exposure;  

       Regulatory Compliance Risk Management ensures that processes are in place to monitor and comply with federal and state banking regulations, including fiduciary compliance processes. The function also has the responsibility for maintenance of an enterprise-wide compliance framework; and  

       The ERM division creates and maintains other functions, committees or processes as are necessary to effectively manage risk throughout the Bancorp.  

 Risk management oversight and governance is provided by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and through multiple management committees whose membership includes a broad cross-section of line of business, affiliate and support representatives. The Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors consists of five outside directors and has the responsibility for the oversight of risk management for the Bancorp, as well as for the Bancorps overall aggregate risk profile. The Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors has approved the formation of key management governance committees that are responsible for evaluating risks and controls. The primary committee responsible for the oversight of risk management is the ERMC. Committees accountable to the ERMC, which support the core risk programs, are the Corporate Credit Committee, the Operational Risk Committee, the Management Compliance Committee, the Executive Asset Liability Management Committee and the Enterprise Marketing Committee. Other committees accountable to the ERMC oversee the ALLL, capital and community reinvestment act/fair lending functions. There are also new products and initiatives processes applicable to every line of business to ensure an appropriate standard readiness assessment is performed before launching a new product or initiative. Significant risk policies approved by the management governance committees are also reviewed and approved by the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors.  

Finally, Credit Risk Review is an independent function responsible for evaluating the sufficiency of underwriting, documentation and approval processes for consumer and commercial credits, the accuracy of risk grades assigned to

 commercial credit exposure, appropriate accounting for charge-offs, and non-accrual status and specific reserves. Credit Risk Review reports directly to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors and administratively to the Director of Internal Audit.  

CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  

The objective of the Bancorps credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis, as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from an individual customer default. The Bancorps credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles: conservatism, diversification and monitoring. The Bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices. These practices include conservative exposure and counterparty limits and conservative underwriting, documentation and collection standards. The Bancorps credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level as well as regular credit examinations and monthly management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality. Lending officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts, the utilization of which is closely monitored. Underwriting activities are centrally managed, and ERM manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly. The Credit Risk Review function, which reports to the Risk and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors, provides objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation, the accuracy of risk grades and the charge-off, nonaccrual and reserve analysis process. The Bancorps credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio, maintain an adequate reserve and take any necessary charge-offs. In addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses, the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems. The risk grading system currently utilized for reserve analysis purposes encompasses ten categories. The Bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system that provides for thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional six grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default. The probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the ten-grade risk rating system. The Bancorp has completed significant validation and testing of the dual risk rating system. Scoring systems, various analytical tools and delinquency monitoring are used to assess the credit risk in the Bancorps homogenous consumer and small business loan portfolios.  

Overview  

General economic conditions remained weak throughout most of 2009, but showed some signs of moderation during 2010. These conditions negatively impacted the 2009 performance of a majority of the Bancorps loan and lease products. Geographically, the Bancorp continues to experience the most stress in Michigan and Florida due to the decline in real estate values. Real estate value deterioration, as measured by the Home Price Index, was most prevalent in Florida due to past real estate price appreciation and related over-development, and in Michigan due in part to cutbacks in automobile manufacturing and the states economic downturn. Among commercial portfolios, the homebuilder and developer and the remaining non-owner occupied commercial real estate portfolios remained under stress throughout 2009 and 2010. 

 Among consumer portfolios, residential mortgage and brokered home equity portfolios exhibited the most stress. Management suspended homebuilder and developer lending in the fourth quarter of 2007 and new commercial non-owner occupied real estate lending in the second quarter of 2008, discontinued the origination of brokered home equity products at the end of 2007 and tightened underwriting standards across both the commercial and consumer loan product offerings. Since the fourth quarter of 2008, in an effort to reduce loan exposure to the real estate and construction industries, the Bancorp has sold certain consumer loans and sold or transferred to held for sale certain commercial loans. Throughout 2009 and 2010, the Bancorp continued to aggressively engage in other loss mitigation strategies such as reducing credit commitments, restructuring certain commercial and consumer loans, tightening underwriting standards on commercial loans and across the consumer loan portfolio, as well as utilizing expanded commercial and consumer loan workout teams. In the financial services industry, there has been heightened focus on foreclosure activity and processes in recent months due to issues concerning documentation supporting foreclosures. Fifth Third actively works with borrowers experiencing difficulties and has modified or provided forbearance to borrowers on approximately $1.8 billion of its own mortgages during the past several years where a workable solution could be found. Foreclosure is a last resort, and the Bancorp undertakes foreclosures only when it believes they are necessary and appropriate and are careful to ensure that customer and loan data are accurate. The Bancorp conducted reviews of its foreclosure processes and procedures in the third quarter of 2010, which did not reveal any material deficiencies, and has continued to expand and extend these reviews and improve its processes as additional aspects of the industrys foreclosure practices have come under intensified scrutiny and criticism. These reviews are ongoing and the Bancorp may determine to amend its processes and procedures as a result of these reviews. While any impact to the Bancorp that ultimately results from continued reviews cannot yet be determined, management currently believes that such impact will not materially adversely affect the Bancorps results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.  

Commercial Portfolio  

The Bancorps credit risk management strategy includes minimizing concentrations of risk through diversification. The Bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry, lines of business within the commercial segment and credit product type.  

 The risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies, continuous loan level reviews, the monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting. The origination policies for commercial real estate outline the risks and underwriting requirements for owner occupied, non-owner occupied and construction lending. Included in the policies are maturity and amortization terms, maximum LTV, minimum debt service coverage ratios, construction loan monitoring procedures, appraisal requirements, pre-leasing requirements (as applicable) and sensitivity and pro-forma analysis requirements. The Bancorp requires an appraisal of collateral be performed at origination and on an as-needed basis, in conformity with market conditions and regulatory requirements. It is the Bancorps policy to obtain an as is value appraisal annually on all criticized assets. Independent reviews are performed on appraisals to ensure the appraiser is qualified and consistency in the evaluation process exists.

Consumer Portfolio  

The Bancorps consumer portfolio is materially comprised of three categories of loans: residential mortgage, home equity, and automobile loans. The Bancorp has identified certain categories within these loan types which it believes represent a higher level of risk compared to the rest of the consumer loan portfolio due to high loan amount to collateral value.  

Residential Mortgage Portfolio  

The Bancorp manages credit risk in the mortgage portfolio through conservative underwriting and documentation standards and geographic and product diversification. The Bancorp may also package and sell loans in the portfolio or may purchase mortgage insurance for the loans sold in order to mitigate credit risk.  

The Bancorp does not originate mortgage loans that permit customers to defer principal payments or make payments that are less than the accruing interest. The Bancorp originates both fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans. 

 Resets of rates on adjustable rate mortgages are not expected to have a material impact on credit costs in the current interest rate environment, as approximately $1.3 billion of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans will have rate resets in 2011, with less than one percent of those resets expected to experience an increase in monthly payments.  

Certain residential mortgage products have contractual features that may increase credit exposure to the Bancorp in the event of a decline in housing prices. These types of mortgage products offered by the Bancorp include loans with high LTV ratios, multiple loans on the same collateral that when combined result in an LTV greater than 80% (80/20 loans) and interest-only loans. The Bancorp monitors residential mortgages loans with greater than 80% LTV ratio and no mortgage insurance as it believes these loans represent a higher level of risk. Tables 31 and 32 provide analysis of the residential mortgage loans outstanding with a greater than 80% LTV ratio and no mortgage insurance as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Home Equity Portfolio  

The home equity portfolio is managed in two categories, loans outstanding with a LTV greater than 80% and those loans with a LTV of less than 80%. The carrying value of the greater than 80% LTV home equity loans and less than 80% LTV home equity loans were $4.6 billion and $6.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2010. Of the total $11.5 billion of outstanding home equity loans, 82% reside within the Bancorps Midwest footprint of Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois. The portfolio has an average FICO score at loan origination of 734 

 at December 31, 2010 compared to 730 at December 31, 2009.  

The Bancorp actively manages lines of credit and makes reductions in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation. The Bancorp believes that home equity loans with a greater than 80% LTV ratio present a higher level of risk. The following tables provide analysis of these loans as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Automobile Portfolio  

The automobile portfolio is characterized by direct and indirect lending products to consumers. As of December 31, 2010, the automobile loan portfolio was comprised of approximately 48% in new automobile loans. It is a common practice to advance on automobile loans an amount in excess 

 of the automobile value due to the inclusion of taxes, title, and other fees paid at closing. The Bancorp monitors its exposure to these higher risk accounts. The following tables provide analysis of the Bancorps automobile loans with a LTV at origination greater than 100% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009.

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Analysis of Nonperforming Assets  

A summary of nonperforming assets is included in Table 37. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of the principal and/or interest is uncertain; restructured consumer loans which are 90 days past due based on the restructured terms and credit card loans immediately upon restructuring; restructured commercial loans which have not yet met the requirements to be classified as a performing asset; and other assets, including OREO and repossessed equipment. Typically, commercial loans, home equity, automobile and other consumer loans and leases are reported on nonaccrual status if principal or interest has been in default for 90 days or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. Residential mortgage loans are typically placed on nonaccrual status when principal and interest payments have become past due 150 days unless such loans are both well secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrual of interest, amortization of loan premiums, accretion of loan discounts and amortization or accretion of deferred net loan fees or costs are discontinued and previously accrued, but unpaid interest is reversed. Commercial loans on nonaccrual status are reviewed for level of impairment at least quarterly. If the principal or a portion of the principal is deemed a loss, the loss amount is charged off to the ALLL.  

 Total nonperforming assets were $2.5 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, $294 million of nonaccrual commercial loans were held-for-sale, a significant portion of which were real estate secured loans in Michigan and Florida. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans, leases and other assets, including OREO and nonaccrual loans held for sale, was 3.08% and 4.38% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Excluding the held-for-sale nonaccrual loans, nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans, 

 leases and other assets, including OREO, as of December 31, 2010 was 2.79% compared to 4.22% as of December 31, 2009. The composition of nonaccrual loans and leases continues to be concentrated in real estate as 66% of nonaccrual loans were secured by real estate as of December 31, 2010 compared to approximately 77% as of December 31, 2009.  

Commercial nonperforming loans and leases decreased to $1.6 billion at December 31, 2010 from $2.6 billion at December 31, 2009 due to the impact of previous loss mitigation actions and moderation in general economic conditions. Excluding nonperforming loans held-for-sale, commercial nonperforming loans and leases decreased from $2.3 billion at December 31, 2009 to $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2010. These decreases were due to the previously discussed factors and the impact of commercial nonperforming loans transferred to held for sale during the third quarter of 2010. The Bancorp transferred commercial loans with a carrying value prior to transfer of $961 million to held for sale during the third quarter, of which $694 million were nonperforming. Of those loans transferred in the third quarter of 2010, 52% were secured by non-owner occupied real estate, including 22% secured by developed and undeveloped land. Approximately 40% of those transferred loans were in Florida or Michigan. The remaining balance of the loans transferred during the third quarter of 2010 was $223 million at December 31, 2010.  

 Consumer nonperforming loans and leases decreased to $466 million as of December 31, 2010, compared to $555 million at December 31, 2009, driven primarily by a $144 million decrease in residential mortgage loans on nonaccrual, partially offset by an $84 million increase in other consumer loans. The decrease in residential mortgage loans was primarily the result of $205 million of nonperforming residential mortgage loans sold during the third quarter of 2010. The increase in other consumer loans was the result 

     Fifth Third Bancorp    53

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 of the Bancorps foreclosure, during the fourth quarter of 2010, on a commercial loan collateralized by individual consumer loans with a carrying value of $78 million that were classified as nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2010. Consumer restructured loans on accrual status totaled $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively, driven by an increased volume of restructured loans. As of December 31, 2010, redefault rates on restructured residential mortgage, home equity loans and credit card loans were 27%, 18% and 20%, respectively.  

Repossessed personal property and OREO increased from $297 million at December 31, 2009 to $494 million at December 31, 2010, driven by higher levels of foreclosures on commercial mortgage loans. At December 31, 2010 OREO totaled $467 million and included $351 million of commercial assets and $116 million of consumer assets. Properties in Michigan and Florida accounted for 49% of foreclosed real estate at December 31, 2010.  

In 2010 and 2009, approximately $10 million and $20 million, respectively, of interest income was recognized on a cash basis for loans on nonaccrual. In 2010 and 2009, additional interest income of approximately $206 million and $236 million, respectively, would have been recorded if the nonaccrual and renegotiated loans and leases on nonaccrual status had been current in accordance with the original terms. Although this value helps demonstrate the costs of carrying nonaccrual credits, the Bancorp does not expect to recover the full amount of interest.  

Analysis of Net Loan Charge-offs  

Net charge-offs were 302 bp of average loans and leases for 2010, compared to 320 bp for 2009. Table 39 provides a summary of credit loss experience and net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding by loan category.  

The ratio of commercial loan net charge-offs to average commercial loans outstanding decreased to 3.10% in 2010 compared to 3.27% in 2009. This improvement was primarily due to actions taken by the Bancorp to address problem loans, reflected by significant net charge-offs recorded in 2008 and 2009 and the impact of loss mitigation activities such as suspending home builder and developer lending and non-owner occupied commercial real estate lending in 2007 and 2008, respectively, and tighter underwriting standards implemented on commercial loan products over the past three years. Net charge-offs for 2010 included $625 million related to non-owner occupied commercial real-estate, a decrease from $721 million in 2009. Charge-offs on these loans represented 46% of all commercial net charge-offs in 2010 and 2009. Florida and Michigan continued to experience the most stress, accounting for approximately 48% of the total net 

 charge-offs in the commercial loan product portfolio in 2010 compared to 44% in 2009.  

The ratio of consumer loan net charge-offs to average consumer loans outstanding decreased to 2.92% in 2010 compared to 3.10% in 2009. Compared to 2009, total consumer net charge-offs decreased $54 million to $964 million in 2010. Residential mortgage loan net charge-offs increased $82 million to $439 million during 2010. The ratio of residential mortgage net charge-offs to average residential mortgage loans increased from 4.15% in 2009 to 5.49% in 2010. These increases were primarily due to $123 million in charge-offs taken on $228 million of portfolio residential mortgage loans sold during the third quarter of 2010. The Bancorps Florida and Michigan markets continue to experience the most stress as residential mortgage loan charge-offs in these states accounted for 72% of residential mortgage net charge-offs during 2010.  

Home equity net charge-offs decreased $58 million to $264 million during 2010. The ratio of home equity net charge-offs to average home equity loans decreased from 2.57% in 2009 to 2.20% in 2010. These decreases are primarily due to a $33 million decrease in net charge-offs on the brokered home equity portfolio and a $20 million decrease in net charge-offs in the Florida and Michigan markets on home equity products originated by the Bancorp. Management responded to the performance of the brokered home equity portfolio by eliminating this channel of origination at the end of 2007. In addition, management actively manages lines of credit and makes reductions in lending limits when it believes it is necessary based on FICO score deterioration and property devaluation.  

Automobile loan net charge offs decreased $60 million to $88 million in 2010. The ratio of automobile loan net charge-offs to average automobile loans was .85% for 2010, a decrease of 83 bp compared to 2009. These decreases are the result of improvements in delinquencies and loss severity as well as improvements made in underwriting over the past three years.  

Credit card net charge-offs decreased $15 million to $155 million in 2010. The net charge-off ratio on credit card balances decreased from 8.87% in 2009 to 8.28% in 2010. The decreases from the prior year are primarily due to the Bancorp actively managing open credit card balances and a decrease in delinquency trends throughout 2010 as general economic conditions began to show signs of improvement. Management expects trends in the charge-off ratio on credit card balances to be consistent with general economic trends, such as unemployment and personal bankruptcy filings. The Bancorp employs a risk-adjusted pricing methodology to help ensure adequate compensation is received for those products that have higher credit costs.

 (a) Nonaccrual loans and leases reflect a reclassification of $84 million in nonperforming loans from commercial and industrial loans to other consumer loans and leases which occurred after the Bancorps Form 8-K was filed on January 19, 2011. This reclassification was primarily a result of the determination that consumer loans obtained in the foreclosure of a commercial loan were more appropriately categorized as other consumer loans and leases in accordance with regulatory guidance.  

 (b) During 2009, the Bancorp modified its consumer nonaccrual policy to exclude TDR loans that were less than 90 days past due because they were performing in accordance with the restructured terms. For comparability purposes, prior periods were adjusted to reflect this reclassification.  

 (c) Excludes nonaccrual loans held for sale.  

 (d) Information for all periods presented excludes advances made pursuant to servicing agreements to GNMA mortgage pools whose repayments are insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs. As of December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, these advances were $279, $130, $40, $25 and $14, respectively.  

Troubled Debt Restructurings  

If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the Bancorp may consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan to maximize collection of amounts due. Typically, these modifications reduce the loan interest rate, extend the loan term, or in limited circumstances, reduce the principal balance of the loan. These modifications are classified as TDRs.  

At the time of modification, the Bancorp maintains certain consumer loan TDRs (including residential mortgage loans, home equity loans, and other consumer loans) on accrual status, 

 provided there is reasonable assurance of repayment and performance according to the modified terms based upon a current, well-documented credit evaluation. Commercial loan TDRs and credit card TDRs are classified as nonaccrual loans and are typically returned to accrual status upon a six month period of sustained performance under the restructured terms. These approaches are consistent with published guidance from regulatory agencies. The following table summarizes TDRs by loan type and delinquency status.

TABLE 39: SUMMARY OF CREDIT LOSS EXPERIENCE  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Allowance for Credit Losses  

The allowance for credit losses is comprised of the ALLL and the reserve for unfunded commitments. The ALLL provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorp evaluates the ALLL each quarter to determine its adequacy to cover inherent losses. Several factors are taken into consideration in the determination of the overall ALLL, including an unallocated component. These factors include, but are not limited to, the overall risk profile of the loan and lease portfolios, net charge-off experience, the extent of impaired loans and leases, the level of nonaccrual loans and leases, the level of 90 days past due loans and leases and the overall percentage level of the ALLL. The Bancorp also considers overall asset quality trends, credit administration and portfolio management practices, risk identification practices, credit policy and underwriting practices, overall portfolio growth, portfolio concentrations and current national and local economic conditions. See the Critical Accounting Policies section for more information.  

In 2010 the Bancorp did not substantively change any material aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the ALLL and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance. In addition to the 

 ALLL, the Bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the Bancorps methodology for determining the ALLL. The provision for unfunded commitments is included in other noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  

Certain inherent, but unconfirmed losses are probable within the loan and lease portfolio. The Bancorps current methodology for determining the level of losses is based on historical loss rates, current credit grades, specific allocation on loans modified in a TDR and impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and other qualitative adjustments. Due to the heavy reliance on realized historical losses and the credit grade rating process, the model derived required reserves tend to slightly lag the deterioration in the portfolio, in a stable or deteriorating credit environment, and tend not to be as responsive when improved conditions have presented themselves. Given these model limitations, the qualitative adjustment factors may be incremental or decremental to the quantitative model results. An unallocated component to the ALLL is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss. The unallocated allowance as a percent of total 

  56    Fifth Third Bancorp    

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

portfolio loans and leases for the year ended December 31, 2010 was .19%, or five percent of the total ALLL, compared to .25%, or five percent of the total ALLL, as of December 31, 2009. The unallocated allowance was held consistent to the total ALLL due to many of the impacts of recent economic events being more fully incorporated into the historical loss rates within the portfolio specific models and stabilization in general economic factors including real estate values in certain of the Bancorps lending markets.  

The ALLL as a percent of the total loan and lease portfolio decreased to 3.88% at December 31, 2010, compared to 4.88% at December 31, 2009. Total ALLL was $3.0 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. This decrease is reflective of a number of factors including decreases in net charge-offs and delinquencies and signs of moderation in general economic conditions during 2010.  

The Bancorps determination of the allowance for commercial loans is sensitive to the risk grades it assigns to these loans. In the event that 10% of commercial loans in each risk category would experience a downgrade of one risk category, the allowance for commercial loans would increase by approximately $156 million at December 31, 2010. In addition, the Bancorps determination of the allowance for residential mortgage loans and consumer loans is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates. In the event that estimated loss rates would increase 10%, the allowance for residential mortgage loans and consumer loans would increase 

 approximately $31 million and $56 million, respectively at December 31, 2010. As several qualitative and quantitative factors are considered in determining the ALLL, these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the ALLL. They are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and estimated loss rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates. Given current processes employed by the Bancorp, management believes the risk grades and estimated loss rates currently assigned are appropriate.  

Total impaired loans consist of loans and leases that are restructured in a troubled debt restructuring and larger commercial loans included with aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding $1 million that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses. Impaired loans are subject to individual review and decreased from $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2009 to $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2010.  

The Bancorp continually reviews its credit administration and loan and lease portfolio and makes changes based on the performance of its products. Management discontinued the origination of brokered home equity products at the end of 2007, suspended homebuilder lending in the fourth quarter of 2007 and new commercial non-owner occupied real estate lending in 2008, and raised underwriting standards across both the commercial and consumer loan product offerings.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  

Market risk arises from the potential for market fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices that may result in potential reductions in net income. Interest rate risk, a component of market risk, is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income or financial position due to changes in interest rates. Management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings. Interest rate risk can occur for any one or more of the following reasons:  

       Assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times;  

       Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts; or  

       The expected maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change.  

In addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, interest rates can indirectly impact earnings through their effect on loan demand, credit losses, mortgage originations, the value of servicing rights and other sources of the Bancorps earnings. Stability of the Bancorps net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk. Management continually reviews the Bancorps balance sheet composition and earnings flows and models the interest rate risk, and possible actions to reduce this risk, given numerous possible future interest rate scenarios.  

Net Interest Income Simulation Model  

The Bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk, including the use of an NII simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates. The model is based on contractual and assumed cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the Bancorps financial instruments and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and liabilities. The model also includes senior management projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the Bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions. Actual results may differ from these simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies.  

The Bancorps Executive ALCO, which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, monitors and manages interest rate risk within Board approved policy limits. In addition to the risk management activities of ALCO, the Bancorp has a Market Risk Management function as part of ERM that provides independent oversight of market risk activities. The Bancorps interest rate risk exposure is currently evaluated by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over 12-month and 24-month horizons assuming a 100 bp parallel ramped increase and a 200 bp parallel ramped increase in interest rates. The Fed Funds interest rate, targeted by the Federal Reserve at a range of 0% to 0.25%, is currently set at a level that would be negative in parallel ramped decrease scenarios; therefore, those scenarios were omitted from the interest rate risk analyses for December 31, 2010. In accordance with the current policy, the rate movements are assumed to occur over one year and are sustained thereafter.  

At December 31, 2010, the Bancorps simulated exposure to a change in interest rates as described above reflects moderate asset sensitivity in year one with increased asset sensitivity in year two. Table 42 shows the Bancorps estimated net interest income sensitivity profile and ALCO policy limits as of December 31, 2010. 

TABLE 42: ESTIMATED NII SENSITIVITY PROFILE  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Economic Value of Equity  

The Bancorp employs EVE as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk. Whereas the earnings simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon, the EVE analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions. The EVE of the balance sheet, at a point in time, is defined as the discounted present value of asset and derivative cash flows less the discounted value of liability cash flows. The sensitivity of EVE to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longer-term interest rate risk. EVE values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions used in the earnings simulation model. As with the earnings simulation model, assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the EVE analysis. Particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the transaction deposit portfolios. The following table shows the Bancorps EVE sensitivity profile as of December 31, 2010.  

TABLE 43: ESTIMATED EVE SENSITIVITY PROFILE  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

This EVE profile suggests that the Bancorp would experience a slight adverse effect from an initial increase in rates, and that the adverse impact would become greater as rates continue to rise. While an instantaneous shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure, the Bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (e.g., the current fiscal year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The NII simulation and EVE analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates.  

The Bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to LIBOR and Prime basis risks, nonparallel shifts in the yield curve and embedded options risk. In addition, the impact on NII and EVE of extreme changes in interest rates is modeled, wherein the Bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environment-specific scenarios.  

Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate Risk  

An integral component of the Bancorps interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates. Examples of derivative instruments that the Bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps, 

  58    Fifth Third Bancorp    

Table of Contents 

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 interest rate floors, interest rate caps, forward contracts, principal only swaps, options and swaptions.  

As part of its overall risk management strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity, the Bancorp enters into forward contracts accounted for as free-standing derivatives to economically hedge interest rate lock commitments that are also considered free-standing derivatives. Additionally, the Bancorp economically hedges its exposure to mortgage loans held for sale.  

The Bancorp also establishes derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge significant exposures assumed in commercial customer accommodation derivative contracts. Generally, these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the Bancorp from market volatility. Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts, which the Bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements, approvals, limits and monitoring procedures. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these derivatives.  

Portfolio Loans and Leases and Interest Rate Risk  

Although the Bancorps portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floating/adjustable rate products, the rates of interest earned by the Bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time. The interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established. Table 44 displays the expected principal cash flows of the Bancorps portfolio loans and leases as of December 31, 2010. Table 45 displays a summary of expected principal cash flows occurring after one year as of December 31, 2010.  

Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights and Interest Rate Risk  

The net carrying amount of the residential MSR portfolio was $822 million and $699 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing, the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing 

fees are collected on repaid loans. The Bancorp maintains a non-qualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its MSR portfolio as a result of changing interest rates.  

Mortgage rates declined during 2010 and 2009. The decrease in rates caused prepayment assumptions to increase and led to $36 million in temporary impairment of servicing rights during the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to $24 million in temporary impairment in 2009. Servicing rights are deemed temporarily impaired when a borrowers loan rate is distinctly higher than prevailing rates. Temporary impairment on servicing rights is reversed when the prevailing rates return to a level commensurate with the borrowers loan rate. Offsetting the mortgage servicing rights valuation, the Bancorp recognized net gains of $123 million and $98 million on its non-qualifying hedging strategy for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The net gains from the Bancorps non-qualifying hedging strategy for 2010 and 2009 include $14 million and $57 million, respectively, of net gains on the sale of securities. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on servicing rights.  

Foreign Currency Risk  

The Bancorp enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans. The derivatives are classified as free-standing instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of the Bancorps foreign denominated loans at December 31, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $283 million and $272 million, respectively. The Bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers involved in international trade to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Bancorp has internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers. These controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts, counterparty credit approvals and country limits.

LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  

The goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand, unexpected deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations. Mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of investment securities, maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits. A summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

The Bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that assesses the liquidity needs under various scenarios of market conditions, asset growth and credit rating downgrades. The plan includes liquidity stress testing which measures various sources and uses of funds under the different scenarios. The contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity.  

The Bancorp has approximately $6.8 billion of unsecured long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2010. Long-term debt with a principal balance of $15 million and a carrying value of $14 million will mature during 2011.  

Sources of Funds  

The Bancorps primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments, payments from securities related to sales and maturities, the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits, in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings.  

Projected contractual maturities from loan and lease repayments are included in Table 44 of the Market Risk Management section. Of the $15.4 billion of securities in the available-for-sale portfolio at December 31, 2010, $4.0 billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next 12 months and an additional $2.5 billion is expected to be received in the next 13 to 24 months. For further information on the Bancorps available-for-sale securities portfolio, see the Investment Securities section of the MD&A.  

 Asset-driven liquidity is provided by the Bancorps ability to sell or securitize loan and lease assets. In order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity, the Bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interest-sensitive assets. A majority of the long-term, fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans underwritten according to FHLMC or FNMA guidelines are sold for cash upon origination. Additional assets such as jumbo fixed-rate residential mortgages, certain commercial loans, home equity lines and loans, automobile loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, loans totaling $18.2 billion and $21.8 billion, respectively, were sold, securitized or transferred off-balance sheet. For further information on the transfer of financial assets, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Core deposits have historically provided the Bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low cost funds. The Bancorps average core deposits and shareholders equity funded 80% of its average total assets during 2010 compared to 72% during 2009. In addition to core deposit funding, the Bancorp also accesses a variety of other short-term and long-term funding sources, which include the use of the FHLB system. Certificates of deposit carrying a balance of $100,000 or more and deposits in the Bancorps foreign branch located in the Cayman Islands are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset growth. Management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs.  

The Bancorp previously participated in the FDICs TAG program that was adopted on November 21, 2008 under EESA. The TAG program provides insurance to any funds held in qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction accounts without limit. On April 13, 2010, the FDIC adopted an interim final rule extending the TAG program for six months, through December 31, 2010, with the possibility of extending the program an additional twelve months without further rulemaking. As a participant in the TAG program, the Bancorp was required to decide whether to opt out of the program on or before April 30, 2010. The Bancorp opted out of the TAG program effective July 1, 2010. After this date, customer accounts that qualified under the TAG program are no longer guaranteed in full, but are insured up to $250,000 under the FDICs general deposit insurance rules.  

The Bancorp has a shelf registration in place with the SEC permitting ready access to the public debt markets and qualifies as a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules. As of December 31, 2010, $8.8 billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance from this shelf registration under the current Bancorps Board of Directors authorizations, however, access to these markets may depend on market conditions. The Bancorp also has $19.0 billion of funding available for issuance through private offerings of debt securities pursuant to its bank note program and currently has approximately $25.3 billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources including the FHLB and FRB.  

 On January 25, 2011, the Bancorp raised $1.7 billion in new common equity through the issuance of 121,428,572 shares of common stock in an underwriting offering at an initial price of $14.00 per share. Additionally, on January 25, 2011, the Bancorp sold $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.625% Senior Notes due January 25, 2016. Note 32 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding the common equity and senior notes offerings.  

Credit Ratings  

The cost and availability of financing to the Bancorp are impacted by its credit ratings. A downgrade to the Bancorps credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs, thereby adversely impacting the Bancorps financial condition and liquidity. Key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and 

  60    Fifth Third Bancorp

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

 diverse earnings stream, strong credit quality, strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources, in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures.  

The Bancorps senior debt credit ratings are summarized in Table 46. The ratings reflect the ratings agencies view on the Bancorps capacity to meet financial commitments.* Additional information on senior debt credit ratings is as follows:  

       Moodys Baa1 rating is considered medium-grade obligations and is the fourth highest ranking within its overall classification system;  

       Standard & Poors BBB rating indicates the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment is adequate and is the fourth highest ranking within its overall classification system;  

       Fitch Ratings A- rating is considered high credit quality and is the third highest ranking within its overall classification system; and  

       DBRS Ltd.s A (low) rating is considered satisfactory credit quality and is the third highest ranking within its overall classification system.  

Additionally, the Bancorps subsidiary bank (Fifth Third Bank) also receives independent credit ratings. On November 1, 2010, Moodys downgraded ten large regional banks, including Fifth Third Bank, due to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Act signaled the governments intent to limit support for individual banks, thus reducing Moodys support assumptions for these banks. Fifth Third Banks credit ratings for Short-Term, Long-Term Deposit, Senior Debt and Subordinated Debt were downgraded to P-2, A3, A3 and Baa1, respectively, from P-1, A2, A2 and A3, respectively. Additionally, Moodys changed Fifth Third Bancorp and Fifth Third Banks outlook from negative to stable. During 2010, DBRS Investors Service downgraded the long-term debt rating and deposit ratings for the Bancorps subsidiary to A from AH.  

* As an investor, you should be aware that a security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, that it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and that each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  

Management, including the Bancorps Board of Directors, regularly reviews the Bancorps capital position to help ensure it is appropriately positioned under various operating environments.  

2009 Capital Actions  

On May 7, 2009, the Bancorp announced its SCAP results which indicated that the Bancorps Tier 1 common equity would be required to be augmented to maintain a capital buffer above the newly required four percent threshold of the Tier 1 common equity ratio under the more adverse scenario of the assessment. The total amount required, prior to considering activities by the Bancorp since the end of the fourth quarter of 2008, was $2.6 billion. 

After considering such activities, primarily the Processing Business Sale, the indicated additional net Tier I common equity required was $1.1 billion. To address the SCAP results the Bancorp undertook a number of capital actions during the second quarter of 2009. The Bancorp completed a $1 billion common stock offering and issued approximately 158 million shares at an average price of $6.33. In addition, the Bancorp completed an exchange of a portion of its Series G preferred stock for 2,158.8272 shares of its common stock, no par value, and $8,250 in cash, for each set of 250 validly tendered and accepted depositary shares. The Bancorp issued approximately 60 million shares of common stock and paid $230 million in cash in exchange for 7 million depositary shares. After settlement of the exchange offer, 4,112,750 depositary shares representing 16,451 shares of Series G preferred stock remained outstanding. As a result of this exchange, the Bancorp increased its common equity by $441 million. The Bancorp also sold its Visa, Inc. Class B common shares resulting in an additional $187 million benefit to equity.  

2011 Capital Actions  

On January 25, 2011, the Bancorp raised $1.7 billion in new common equity through the issuance of 121,428,572 shares of common stock in an underwriting offering at an initial price of $14.00 per share. On January 24, 2011, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional 12,142,857 shares at the offering price of $14.00 per share. In connection with this exercise, the Bancorp elected that all such additional shares be sold and the Bancorp entered into a forward sale agreement which resulted in a final net payment of 959,821 shares on February 4, 2011.  

On February 2, 2011, the Bancorp redeemed all 136,320 shares of its Series F Preferred Stock held by the U.S. Treasury totaling $3.4 billion. The Bancorp used the net proceeds from the common stock and senior notes offerings previously described and other funds to redeem the Series F Preferred Stock.  

In connection with the redemption of the Series F Preferred Stock, the Bancorp accelerated the accretion of the remaining issuance discount on the Series F Preferred Stock and recorded a corresponding reduction in retained earnings of $153 million.  

Dividends of $15 million were paid on February 2, 2011 when the Series F Preferred Stock was redeemed. The Bancorp notified the U.S. Treasury on February 17, 2011, of its intention to negotiate for the purchase of the warrants issued to the U.S. Treasury in connection with the CPP preferred stock investment.  

These transactions will be reflected in the Bancorps consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2011. Note 32 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements provides additional information regarding the redemption of the Series F Preferred Stock and the January 2011 common stock offering.

Capital Ratios  

The Federal Reserve Board established quantitative measures that assign risk weightings to assets and off-balance sheet items and also define and set minimum regulatory capital requirements (risk-based capital ratios). Additionally, the guidelines define well-capitalized ratios for Tier I and total risk-based capital as 6% and 10%, respectively. The Bancorp exceeded these well-capitalized ratios for all periods presented. Additionally, although the assessed companies under SCAP were only required to demonstrate that they met the 4% Tier I common equity ratio requirement for the period evaluated in the SCAP, it is reasonable to assume the supervisory agencies expect the 19 large bank holding companies assessed under the SCAP stress tests to maintain their Tier I common equity ratio above 4%, although no formal requirement exists.  

On November 17, 2010, the Federal Reserve issued a revised temporary addendum to Supervision and Regulation letter 09-4, Dividend Increases and Other Capital Distributions for the 19 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program Firms. This letter requires the 19 financial institutions including the Bancorp, to undergo a review of their capital planning processes and plans regarding capital redistribution and absorption activity. As part of this review, the Bancorp was required to submit a comprehensive capital plan by January 7, 2011, that demonstrated its ability to withstand losses under adverse economic conditions over the next two years. The Bancorp submitted all of its documents according to the regulatory timeline. The results of this assessment process are not expected to be made public.  

Current provisions of the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Act will phase out the inclusion of certain trust preferred securities as a component of Tier I capital beginning January 1, 2013. At December 31, 2010, the Bancorps Tier I capital included $2.8 billion of trust preferred securities representing approximately 276 bp of risk-weighted assets.  

The Bancorp manages the adequacy of its capital, including Tier I common equity, by conducting ongoing internal stress tests and ensuring the results are properly considered in capital planning. It is the intent of the Bancorps capital planning process to ensure that the Bancorps capital positions remain 

 in excess of well-capitalized minimums as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in the Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Bank Holding Companies, and any other regulatory requirements. The Bancorps Tier I common equity ratio was 7.50% as of December 31, 2010.  

Dividend Policy and Stock Repurchase Program  

The Bancorps common stock dividend policy and stock repurchase program reflect its earnings outlook, desired payout ratios, the need to maintain adequate capital levels, alternative investment opportunities and the need to comply with safe and sound banking practices as well as meet regulatory expectations. In each of the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Bancorp paid dividends per common share of $0.04.  

The Bancorp issued $3.4 billion in senior preferred stock (Series F) and related warrants to the U.S. Treasury as part of the CPP. Upon issuance, the Bancorp agreed to limit dividends to common stock holders to the quarterly dividend rate paid prior to October 14, 2008, which was $0.15. This restriction was in effect until the earlier of December 31, 2011 or the date upon which the Series F senior preferred shares were redeemed in whole or transferred to an unaffiliated third party. On February 2, 2011, the Bancorp repurchased all $3.4 billion of its Series F Preferred Stock held by the U.S. Treasury.  

The Bancorps repurchase of common stock is shown in Table 48. The Bancorps Board of Directors had previously authorized management to purchase 30 million shares of the Bancorps common stock through the open market or in any private transaction. The authorization does not include specific price targets or an expiration date. Under the agreement with the U.S. Treasury, as part of the CPP, the Bancorp is restricted in its repurchases of its common stock. This restriction was in effect until the earlier of December 31, 2011 or the date upon which the Series F senior preferred shares were redeemed in whole or transferred to an unaffiliated third party. On February 2, 2011, the Bancorp repurchased all $3.4 billion of its Series F Preferred Stock held by the U.S. Treasury.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

In the ordinary course of business, the Bancorp enters into financial transactions to extend credit and various forms of commitments and guarantees that may be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. These transactions involve varying elements of market, credit and liquidity risk.  

Residential Mortgage Loan Sales  

Conforming residential mortgage loans sold to unrelated third parties are generally sold with representation and warranty recourse provisions. Such provisions include the loans compliance with applicable loan criteria, including certain documentation standards per agreements with the unrelated third parties. Additional reasons for the Bancorp having to repurchase the loans include appraisal standards with the collateral, fraud related to the loan application and the rescission of mortgage insurance. Under these provisions, the Bancorp is required to repurchase any previously sold loan for which the representation or warranty of the Bancorp proves to be inaccurate, incomplete or misleading. As of December 31, 2010, and 2009, the Bancorp maintained reserves related to these loans sold with the representation and warranty recourse provisions totaling $85 million and $37 million, respectively.  

For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Bancorp paid $47 million and $19 million, respectively, in the form of make whole payments and repurchased approximately $83 million and $61 million, respectively, of loans to satisfy third party representation and warranty claims. Total repurchase demand requests during 2010 were $365 million compared to $210 million during 2009. Total outstanding repurchase demand inventory was $162 million at December 31, 2010, compared to $119 million at December 31, 2009.  

The Bancorp previously sold certain residential mortgage loans in the secondary market with credit recourse. In the event of any customer default, pursuant to the credit recourse provided, the Bancorp is required to reimburse the third party. The maximum amount of credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to the total outstanding balance. In the event of nonperformance, the Bancorp has rights to the underlying collateral value securing the loan. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding balances on these loans sold with credit recourse were approximately $916 million and $1.1 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Bancorp maintained an estimated credit loss reserve on these loans sold with credit recourse of approximately $16 million and $21 million, respectively, recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. To determine the credit loss reserve, the Bancorp used an approach that is consistent with its overall approach in estimating credit losses for various categories of residential mortgage loans held in its loan portfolio. For further information on residential mortgage loans sold with recourse, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Private Mortgage Insurance  

For certain mortgage loans originated by the Bancorp, borrowers may be required to obtain PMI provided by third-party insurers. In some instances, these insurers cede a portion of the PMI premiums to the Bancorp, and the Bancorp provides reinsurance coverage within a specified range of the total PMI coverage. The Bancorps reinsurance coverage typically ranges from 5% to 10% of the total PMI coverage. During the second quarter of 2009, the Bancorp suspended the practice of providing reinsurance of private mortgage insurance for newly originated mortgage loans.  

The Bancorps maximum exposure in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers is equivalent to 

 the Bancorps total outstanding reinsurance coverage, which was $122 million and $182 million, respectively, at December 31, 2010 and 2009. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Bancorp maintained a reserve of $42 million and $44 million, respectively, related to exposures within the reinsurance portfolio. The reserve was flat year over year as increases to the reserve resulting from estimated losses outpacing paid claims were offset by a decrease relating to a reinsurance agreement termination. In the third quarter of 2010, the Bancorp allowed one of its third-party insurers to terminate its reinsurance agreement with the Bancorp. This resulted in the Bancorp releasing collateral to the insurer in the form of investment securities and other assets with a carrying value of $19 million, and the insurer assuming the Bancorps obligations under the reinsurance agreement, resulting in a decrease to the Bancorps reserve liability of $20 million and a decrease to the Bancorps maximum exposure of $53 million.  

Loan Securitizations  

The Bancorp utilizes securitization trusts, formed by independent third parties to facilitate the securitization process of residential mortgage loans, certain automobile loans and other consumer loans. During 2008, the Bancorp sold $2.7 billion of automobile loans in three separate transactions. Each transaction isolated the related loans through the use of a securitization trust or a conduit, formed as QSPEs, to facilitate the securitization process in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The QSPEs issued asset-backed securities with varying levels of credit subordination and payment priority. The investors in these securities have no credit recourse to the Bancorps other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due. During 2008 and 2009, required repurchases of previously transferred automobile loans from the QSPE were immaterial to the Bancorps Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information on these automobile securitizations, see Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Upon adoption on January 1, 2010 of the FASB guidance on the accounting for QSPEs and VIEs, the Bancorp determined it was the primary beneficiary (and therefore consolidator) of these QSPEs. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the guidance and the related impact of adoption by the Bancorp.  

Commercial Loan Sales to a QSPE  

Through 2008, the Bancorp had transferred at par, subject to credit recourse, certain primarily floating-rate, short-term investment grade commercial loans to a VIE, which prior to January 1, 2010, was an unconsolidated QSPE that was wholly owned by an independent third-party. Generally, the loans transferred to the VIE provided a lower yield due to their investment grade nature and, therefore, transferring these loans allowed the Bancorp to reduce its interest rate exposure to these lower yielding loan assets while maintaining the customer relationships. The outstanding balance of these loans at December 31, 2009 was $771 million. These loans may have been transferred back to the Bancorp upon the occurrence of certain specified events. These events included borrower default on the loans transferred, ineligible loans transferred by the Bancorp to the VIE, the inability of the VIE to issue commercial paper, and in certain circumstances, bankruptcy preferences initiated against underlying borrowers. The maximum amount of credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the underlying borrowers was approximately equivalent to the total outstanding balance. At December 31, 2009, the Bancorps loss reserve related to the credit enhancement provided to the VIE was $45 million and was recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the VIE did not transfer any loans back to the Bancorp as a result of a credit event.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The VIE issued commercial paper and used the proceeds to fund the acquisition of commercial loans transferred to it by the Bancorp. The ability of the VIE to issue commercial paper was a function of general market conditions and the credit rating of the liquidity provider. In the event the VIE was unable to issue commercial paper, the Bancorp agreed to provide liquidity support in the form of a line of credit to the VIE and the repurchase of assets from the VIE. As of December 31, 2009, the LAPA was $1.4 billion. In addition to the liquidity support options discussed above, the Bancorp also purchased commercial paper issued by the VIE. 

 Beginning in 2008 and continuing through the year ended December 31, 2009, dislocation in the short-term funding market caused the VIE difficulty in obtaining sufficient funding through the issuance of commercial paper. As a result, the Bancorp purchased commercial paper throughout 2009. As of December 31, 2009, the Bancorp held $805 million of asset-backed commercial paper issued by the VIE, representing 87% of the total commercial paper issued by the VIE.  

Effective January 1, 2010, with the adoption of guidance amending the accounting for QSPEs and the consolidation of VIEs, the Bancorp determined it was the primary beneficiary (and therefore consolidator) of this VIE. Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the guidance and the related impact of adoption by the Bancorp.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  

The Bancorp has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts. The aggregate contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2010 are shown in Table 49. As of December 31, 2010, the Bancorp has unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate in future periods. Due to 

 the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such payments, all uncertain tax liabilities that have not been paid have been excluded from the Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments table. For further detail on the impact of income taxes see Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

TABLE 49: CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Includes demand, interest checking, savings, money market and foreign office deposits. For additional information, see the Deposits discussion in the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A.  

 (b) Includes other time and certificates $100,000 and over. For additional information, see the Deposits discussion in the Balance Sheet Analysis section of MD&A.  

 (c) In the banking industry, interest-bearing obligations are principally used to fund interest-earning assets. As such, interest charges on contractual obligations were excluded from reported amounts, as the potential cash outflows would have corresponding cash inflows from interest-earning assets. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these debt instruments.  

 (d) See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on forward contracts to sell residential mortgage loans.  

 (e) Includes federal funds purchased and borrowings with an original maturity of less than one year. For additional information, see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (f) Includes rental commitments.  

 (g) Includes low-income housing, historic tax investments and market tax credits.  

 (h) See Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on pension obligations.  

 (i) Represents agreements to purchase goods or services and includes commitments to various general contractors for work related to banking center construction.  

 (j) Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend, typically having fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses that may require payment of a fee. Many of the commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. The total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash flow requirements. For additional information, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  

 (k) Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. For additional information, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AS TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING  

The Bancorp conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Bancorps management, including the Bancorps Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Bancorps disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act). Based on the foregoing, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Bancorps Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Bancorps disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports the Bancorp files and submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and information is accumulated and communicated to management on a timely basis.  

The management of Fifth Third Bancorp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Bancorps management assessed the effectiveness of the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. Managements assessment is based on the criteria established in the Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and was designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Bancorp maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. The Bancorps independent registered public accounting firm, that audited the Bancorps consolidated financial statements included in this annual report, has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. This report appears on page 67 of the annual report.  

The Bancorps management also conducted an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the year covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, there has been no such change during the year covered by this report.

REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp:  

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the Bancorp) as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Bancorps management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Assessment as to the Effectiveness of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

In our opinion, the Bancorp maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010 of the Bancorp and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Fifth Third Bancorp:  

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries (the Bancorp) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Bancorps management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Fifth Third Bancorp and subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Bancorps internal control over financial reporting.
