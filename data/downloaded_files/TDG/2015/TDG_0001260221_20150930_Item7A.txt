ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rates. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate and floating-rate long-term debt. At September 30, 2015, we had borrowings under our term loans of approximately $4,377 million that were subject to interest rate risk. Borrowings under our term loans bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either an alternate base rate or an adjusted LIBOR for a one-, two-, three- or six-month (or to the extent available to each lender, nine- or twelve-month) interest period chosen by us, in each case, plus an applicable margin percentage. Accordingly, the Companyâ€™s cash flows and earnings will be exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes resulting from variable rate borrowings under our term loans. The effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the annual interest costs under our term loans by approximately $44 million based on the amount of outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2015. The weighted average interest rate on the $4,377 million of borrowings under our term loans on September 30, 2015 was 4.0%. 

At September 30, 2015, five forward-starting interest rate swap agreements beginning March 31, 2016 were in place to hedge the variable interest rates on the 2014 Term Loans for a fixed rate based on an aggregate notional amount of $750 million through June 30, 2020. These forward-starting interest rate swap agreements will effectively convert the variable interest rate on the aggregate notional amount of the 2014 Term Loans to a fixed rate of 5.8% (2.8% plus the 3% margin percentage) over the term of the interest rate swap agreements.

At September 30, 2015, three interest rate swap agreements beginning September 30, 2014 were in place to hedge the variable interest rates on the 2014 Term Loans for a fixed rate based on an aggregate notional amount of $1,000 million through June 30, 2019. These interest rate swap agreements converted the variable interest rate on the aggregate notional amount of the 2014 Term Loans to a fixed rate of 5.4% (2.4% plus the 3% margin percentage) over the term of the interest rate swap agreements.

During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, three forward-starting interest rate swap agreements were in place to swap variable rates on the 2014 Term Loans for a fixed rate based on an aggregate notional amount of $353 million through June 30, 2015. These interest rate swap agreements converted the variable interest rate on the aggregate notional amount of the 2014 Term Loans to a fixed rate of 5.2% (2.2% plus the 3% margin percentage) over the term of the interest rate swap agreements.

At September 30, 2015, six interest rate cap agreements beginning September 30, 2015 were in place to offset the variable interest rates on the 2015 Term Loans based on an aggregate notional amount of $750 million. These interest rate cap agreements offset the variability in expected future cash flows on the Company's variable rate debt attributable to fluctuations above the three month LIBOR of 2.5% through June 30, 2020.

The fair value of the approximately $4,377 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings under our term loans is exposed to the market risk of interest rates. The estimated fair value of such term loans approximated $4,344 million at September 30, 2015 based upon information provided to the Company from its agent under the term loans. The fair value of our $550 million 2020 Notes, our $500 million 2021 Notes, our $1,150 million 2022 Notes, our $1,200 million 2024 Notes and our $450 million 2025 Notes are exposed to the market risk of interest rate changes. The estimated fair value of the 2020 Notes approximated $520 million, the estimated fair value of the 2021 Notes approximated $524 million, the estimated fair value of the 2022 Notes approximated $1,081 million, the estimated fair value of the 2024 Notes approximated $1,119 million and the estimated fair value of the 2025 Notes approximated $417 million at September 30, 2015 based upon quoted market rates.
