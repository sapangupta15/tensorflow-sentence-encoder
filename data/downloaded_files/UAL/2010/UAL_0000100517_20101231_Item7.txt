ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

Overview  

United Continental Holdings, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, UAL) is a holding company and its principal, wholly-owned subsidiaries are United Air Lines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, United) and, effective October 1, 2010, Continental Airlines, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, Continental). Upon closing of the Merger UAL Corporation changed its name to United Continental Holdings, Inc. We sometimes use the words we, our, us, and the Company in this Form 10-K for disclosures that relate to all of UAL, United and Continental.  

This Annual Report on Form 10-K is a combined report of UAL, United, and Continental including their respective consolidated financial statements. As UAL consolidates United and Continental for financial statement purposes, disclosures that relate to United activities also apply to UAL and disclosures that relate to Continental activities after the Merger closing date also apply to UAL, unless otherwise noted. When appropriate, UAL, United and Continental are named specifically for their related activities and disclosures.  

2010 Financial Highlights  

       UAL recorded net income of $253 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to a net loss of $651 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. UALs financial performance improved significantly in 2010 primarily as a result of an improvement in global economic conditions following the severe recession in 2008 and 2009. Excluding special items, UAL recorded net income of $942 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared to a net loss of $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. See Item 6 for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP net income.  

       UAL passenger revenue increased 43% during 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to higher fares and an increase in high-yield business traffic resulting from improved economic conditions in 2010 and the impact of Continental passenger revenue after the closing date of the Merger.

       UALs unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balance at December 31, 2010 was a record $8.7 billion as compared to $3.0 billion at December 31, 2009. This increase in UALs cash, cash equivalents and short term investments balance was primarily due to $4.2 billion of Continentals cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments acquired in connection with the Merger and $1.9 billion of cash from operating activities.  

2010 Operational Highlights  

       For the year ended December 31, 2010, United and Continental achieved solid results in DOT on-time arrival and completion factor, as summarized in the following table:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

       Including Continentals fourth quarter results, consolidated ASMs for 2010 were up 20.5% while consolidated revenue passenger miles (RPMs) increased 23.3%, resulting in a consolidated load factor of 83.1%, as compared to 81.2% in 2009.  

       Continental took delivery of 14 new fuel-efficient Boeing aircraft during 2010. In addition, both United and Continental continue to improve their premium cabins, upgrading 109 aircraft with lie-flat seats and improving in-flight entertainment technology.  

Outlook  

Set forth below is a discussion of the principal matters that we believe could impact our financial and operating performance and cause our results of operations in future periods to differ materially from our historical operating results and/or from our anticipated results of operations described in our forward-looking statements in this report. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion of these and other factors that could affect us.  

Economic Conditions. The severe global economic recession significantly diminished the demand for air travel resulting in a difficult financial environment for U.S. network carriers in 2008 and 2009. UALs financial performance improved significantly in 2010 primarily as a result of improving global economic conditions. Although we continue to see indications that the airline industry is experiencing a recovery, including strengthening demand and improving revenue, we cannot predict whether the demand for air travel will continue to improve or the rate of such improvement. Worsening economic conditions resulting in diminished demand for air travel may impair our ability to sustain the profitability we achieved in 2010.  

Merger Integration. UAL expects the Merger to deliver $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion in net annual synergies on a run-rate basis by 2013, including between $800 million and $900 million of incremental annual revenues, in large part from expanded customer options resulting from the greater scope and scale of the network, fleet optimization and additional international service enabled by a broader combined network. UAL expects to realize between $200 million and $300 million of net cost synergies on a run-rate basis by 2013. In addition, UAL expects that approximately 25% of its gross synergies will be realized in 2011.  

The Company also expects to incur a significant amount of additional substantial merger-related expenses and charges. There are many factors that could affect the total amount or the timing of those expenses and charges, and many of the expenses and charges that will be incurred are, by their nature, uncertain and difficult to estimate accurately. See Note 1 and Note 21 to the financial statements in Item 8 and Item 1A, Risk Factors, for additional information.

Since the closing of the Merger, the Company has taken significant steps toward the operational integration of United and Continental. The Company has begun to optimize the gauge and frequency of its fleet in order to meet travel demand and capitalize on its combined global network efficiently. The introduction of new services to markets previously not served by either carrier allows the Company to meet the passenger demand created through the larger, more comprehensive network. The Company is also aligning revenue management and pricing systems, as well as inventory management strategies, allowing it to create new revenue opportunities and other efficiencies for the combined company. In addition, the Company has begun to align its employee incentive programs, including its on-time bonus, perfect attendance and profit sharing programs.  

During 2011 and into 2012, the Company expects to continue to harmonize into the new United brand the products and services offered by its two carriers. The harmonization will involve streamlined customer policies, aligned check-in and boarding procedures, migration to a single reservations system, and linkage of loyalty program accounts until the introduction of a combined loyalty program for 2012, among other events. The Company continues to integrate its operations and, by the end of the second quarter of 2011, expects to be co-located at more than 35 airports, including all of its hubs. By the end of 2011, the Company expects to receive a single operating certificate for United and Continental from the FAA. The Company has begun the transition to selected information technology platforms that support its commercial and operational processes, which is expected to take more than one year to complete.  

Fuel Costs. Fuel costs were less volatile in 2010 as compared to recent years; however, prices increased significantly late in 2010 and in the first two months of 2011. UALs average aircraft fuel price per gallon including related taxes and excluding hedge impact was $2.35 in 2010 as compared to $1.84 in 2009. If fuel prices rise significantly from their current levels, we may be unable to raise fares or other fees sufficiently to fully offset our increased costs. In addition, high fuel prices may impair our ability to sustain the profitability we achieved in 2010. Based on projected fuel consumption in 2011, a one dollar change in the price of a barrel of crude oil would change UALs annual fuel expense by approximately $100 million, assuming there are no changes to the crude oil to aircraft fuel refining margins and no impact from our fuel hedging program. To protect against increases in the prices of fuel, the Company routinely hedges a portion of its future fuel requirements, provided the hedges are expected to be cost effective. See Note 13 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional details regarding the Companys hedging activities.  

Additional Revenue-Generating and Cost Saving Measures. We intend to offer additional goods and services relating to air travel, a portion of which will come from the unbundling of our current product and a portion of which will come from future goods and services that we do not presently offer. The revenues that we derive from these products and services, which are generally referred to as ancillary revenues, typically have higher margins than that of our core transportation services and are an important element of our strategy to sustain the profitability that we achieved in 2010. The unbundling of our current products and services permits our customers flexibility in selecting the products and services they wish to purchase. An example of a new service that we have introduced is Continentals FareLock, introduced in December 2010, which is an option that offers customers the opportunity, for a fee, to hold reservations and lock-in ticket prices for either 72 hours or seven days with no commitment to purchase a ticket.  

Additionally, we expect to continue to invest in technology that is designed to both assist customers with self-service and allow us to make better operational decisions, while lowering our operating costs.  

Capacity. We announced new service to several international destinations in 2010, including Lagos, Nigeria, Cairo, Egypt and Auckland, New Zealand. We do not anticipate significant capacity growth in 2011 unless the level of demand for air travel, economic conditions and the expected financial benefit sufficiently justify such growth. We expect only modest capacity growth for 2011, with both our mainline and consolidated capacity increasing between 1.0% and 2.0%. We expect consolidated domestic capacity to decrease between 0.5% and 1.5% and consolidated international capacity to increase between 4.5% and 5.5%. Should fuel prices increase significantly, we would likely adjust our capacity plans downward.

Our future ability to grow or improve our efficiency could be adversely impacted by manufacturer delays in aircraft deliveries. We have not received a revised 787 delivery schedule, but we currently expect the first of our Boeing 787 aircraft to be delivered in the first half of 2012.  

Labor Costs. Our ability to achieve and sustain profitability also depends on continuing our efforts to implement and maintain a more competitive cost structure. As of December 31, 2010, United and Continental had approximately 82% and 60%, respectively, of employees represented by unions. All of Uniteds union-represented employees and 53% of Continentals union-represented employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are currently amendable. We are in the process of negotiating amended collective bargaining agreements with our employee groups. The Company cannot predict the outcome of negotiations with its unionized employee groups, although significant increases in the pay and benefits resulting from new collective bargaining agreements could have an adverse financial impact on the Company. See Note 17 to the financial statements in Item 8 and Item 1, Business, for additional information.  

Results of Operations   

To provide a more meaningful comparison of UALs 2010 financial performance to 2009, we have quantified the increases relating to our operating results that are due to Continental operations after the Merger closing date. The increases due to the Merger, presented in the tables below, represent actual Continental results for the fourth quarter of 2010. The discussion of UALs results excludes the impact of Continentals results in the fourth quarter of 2010. Intercompany transactions were immaterial.  

Operating Revenues.  

2010 compared to 2009  

The table below illustrates the year-over-year percentage change in UALs operating revenues for the years ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):

The table below presents UALs passenger revenues and selected operating data based on geographic region:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) See Item 6 for the definition of these statistics.  

Excluding the impact of the Merger, consolidated passenger revenue in 2010 increased approximately $2.9 billion, or 21%, as compared to 2009. These increases were due to increases of 19.0% and 16.1% in average fare and yield, respectively, over the same period as a result of strengthening economic conditions and industry capacity discipline. An increase in volume in 2010, as measured by passenger volume, also contributed to the increase in revenues in 2010 as compared to 2009. The revenue improvement in 2010 was also driven by the return of business and international premium cabin passengers whose higher ticket prices combined to increase average fares and yields. The international regions in particular had the largest increases in demand with international passenger revenue per ASM increasing 29.9% on a 1.8% increase in capacity. Passenger revenue in 2010 included approximately $250 million of additional revenue due to changes in the Companys estimate and methodology related to loyalty program accounting as noted in Critical Accounting Policies, below.  

Excluding the impact of the Merger, cargo revenue increased by $177 million, or 33%, in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to improved economic conditions resulting in improved traffic and yield. UALs freight ton miles improved by 22.1% in 2010 as compared to 2009, while mail ton miles dropped approximately 8.8% during the same period, for a composite cargo traffic gain of 18.3%. Freight yields in 2010 were 15.0% better than in 2009 due to stronger freight traffic, reduced industry capacity and numerous tactical rate recovery initiatives, particularly in UALs Pacific markets. On a composite basis, cargo yield in 2010 increased 12.6% as compared to 2009.  

Excluding the impact of the Merger, other operating revenue was up 14% in 2010, as compared to 2009, which was primarily due to growth in ancillary passenger-related charges such as baggage fees.  

2009 compared to 2008

The table below presents UALs passenger revenues and selected operating data based on geographic region:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Consistent with the rest of the airline industry, UALs decline in PRASM was partially driven by a precipitous decline in worldwide travel demand as a result of the severe global recession. Two key factors had a distinct impact on UALs revenue during 2009. First, network composition played a role in overall unit revenue decline. International markets, in particular the Pacific region, experienced more significant unit revenue declines as compared to the other regions. Given UALs significant international network and its historic relative contribution to passenger revenue, UALs revenue was significantly impacted by the contraction in travel demand in the Pacific. Second, while demand generally declined across all geographic regions, premium and business demand declined more significantly than leisure demand. As UALs business model is strongly aligned to serve premium and business travelers, both internationally and domestically, the decrease in travel by business travelers and the buy-down from premium class to economy class by some business travelers caused a significant negative impact on UALs results in 2009.  

In 2009, consolidated yield decreased 14.7% as compared to 2008, while consolidated average fare per passenger decreased 15.4% in the same period. The yield and average fare decreases were primarily a result of the weak economic environment in 2009 and the resulting adverse economic impacts on UAL, as discussed above. Consolidated revenue was also negatively impacted by lower volumes of traffic due to the effects of the severe global recession.  

Consolidated revenues were favorably impacted in 2009 by an adjustment of approximately $36 million related to certain tax accruals that were previously recorded as a reduction of revenue. This adjustment was recorded as a result of new information received by UAL related to these tax matters.  

Cargo revenue declined by $318 million, or 37%, in 2009 as compared to 2008, due to four key factors. First, United took significant steps to rationalize its capacity, with reduced international capacity affecting a number of key cargo markets. Second, as noted by industry statistical releases during 2009, virtually all carriers in the industry, including United, were sharply impacted by reduced air freight and mail volumes driven by lower recessionary demand, with the resulting oversupply of cargo capacity putting pressure on industry pricing in nearly all markets. Some of the largest industry demand reductions occurred in the Pacific cargo market, where United has a greater cargo capacity as compared to the Atlantic, Latin and Domestic cargo markets. Third, lower fuel costs in 2009 also reduced cargo revenue through lower fuel surcharges on cargo shipments as compared to 2008 when historically high fuel prices occurred. Finally, United, historically one of the largest carriers of U.S. international mail, was impacted by lower mail volumes and pricing beginning in third quarter of 2009 arising from U.S. international mail deregulation. The deregulation moved pricing from regulated rates set by the DOT to market-based pricing as a result of a competitive bidding process.  

44  

Table of Contents 

In 2009, the increase in other operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in ancillary passenger-related revenues, which includes baggage fees and other unbundled services. For the full year of 2009, ancillary passenger-related revenues totaled approximately $1.1 billion.  

Operating Expenses.  

2010 compared to 2009  

The table below includes data related to UALs operating expenses for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to increased market prices for fuel, as shown in the table below which reflects the significant changes in aircraft fuel cost per gallon for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The 2010 amounts presented in the table below exclude the impact of Continentals results after the closing date of the Merger. See Note 13 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional details regarding gains and losses from settled positions and unrealized gains and losses at the end of the period.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Excluding the impact of the Merger, salaries and related costs increased $297 million, or 8%, in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase was primarily due to increased accruals for profit sharing and other annual incentive plans. In 2010, UALs accrual for profit sharing was $166 million. Expense for the plan was not accrued in 2009 as the profit sharing and other incentive plan payouts were not earned based on UALs adjusted pre-tax losses.  

Excluding the impact of the Merger, regional capacity purchase expense increased $87 million, or 6%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in capacity in the same period.  

45  

Table of Contents 

Excluding the impact of the Merger, distribution expenses increased $86 million, or 13%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in passenger revenue on higher traffic and yields driving increases in commissions, credit card fees and GDS fees.  

Excluding the impact of the Merger, aircraft rent expense decreased by $20 million, or 6%, in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily as a result of Uniteds retirement of its entire fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, some of which were financed through operating leases. This fleet retirement was completed during 2009.  

Merger-related Costs and Special Charges.  

The table below presents asset impairments, merger-related costs and special items incurred by UAL during the years ended December 31 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

See Note 21 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional information related to special charges.  

Merger-related costs  

Merger-related costs consist of charges related to the Merger and include costs related to the planning and execution of the Merger, including costs for items such as financial advisor, legal and other advisory fees. Also included in merger-related costs are salary and severance related costs that are primarily associated with administrative headcount reductions and compensation costs related to the Merger. Merger-related costs also include integration costs, costs to terminate certain service contracts that will not be used by the combined company, costs to write-off system assets that are no longer used or planned to be used by the combined company and payments to third-party consultants to assist with integration planning and organization design. See Notes 1 and 21 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional information.  

Asset impairments  

The aircraft impairments in 2010 and 2009 are primarily related to a decrease in the estimated market value of UALs nonoperating Boeing 737 and 747 aircraft. In 2010, UAL recorded a $29 million impairment ($18 million net of taxes) of its indefinite-lived Brazil routes due to an estimated decrease in the value of these routes as a result of the new open skies agreement.  

During 2010, UAL determined it overstated its deferred tax liabilities by approximately $64 million when it applied fresh start accounting upon its exit from bankruptcy in 2006. Under applicable standards in 2008, this error would have been corrected with a decrease to goodwill, which would have resulted in a decrease in the amount of UALs 2008 goodwill impairment charge. Therefore, UAL corrected this overstatement in the fourth quarter of 2010 by reducing its deferred tax liabilities and recorded it as a goodwill impairment credit in its  

46  

Table of Contents 

 consolidated statement of operations. The adjustment was not made to prior periods as UAL does not believe the correction is material to the current or any prior period.  

In 2009, UAL recorded a $150 million intangible asset impairment ($95 million net of taxes) to decrease the value of Uniteds tradename, which was primarily due to a decrease in estimated future revenues resulting from the weak economic environment and Uniteds capacity reductions, among other factors.  

In 2009, UAL recorded special charges of $27 million related to the final settlement of the LAX municipal bond litigation and $104 million primarily related to Boeing 737 aircraft lease terminations.  

During the fourth quarter of 2010, UAL recorded $130 million to other operating expense, $65 million each for United and Continental, due to revenue sharing obligations related to the trans-Atlantic joint venture with Lufthansa and Air Canada. This expense relates to UALs payments for the first nine months of 2010, prior to contract execution.  

2009 compared to 2008  

UALs mainline capacity decreased 9.7% in 2009 as compared to 2008. The capacity reduction had a significantly favorable impact on certain UAL operating expenses, as further described below. The table below includes data related to UALs operating expenses for the year ended December 31 (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decrease in aircraft fuel expense was primarily attributable to decreased market prices for fuel, as shown in the table below, which reflects the significant changes in fuel cost per gallon in 2009 as compared to 2008. Lower mainline fuel consumption due to the mainline capacity reductions also benefited mainline fuel expense in 2009 as compared to the prior year. Prior to April 1, 2010, UAL did not designate any of its fuel hedge contracts under applicable accounting standards. Therefore, UAL marked-to-market changes in the fair value of its contracts through fuel expense in the case of economic hedges and through nonoperating expense in the case of hedges that were not considered to be economic hedges. The majority of the combined $1.1 billion of fuel hedge losses in 2008 was due to mark-to-market losses on open fuel hedge contracts at December 31, 2008. These contracts cash settled in 2009. These significant losses occurred because certain UAL hedge instruments required payments by UAL to the counterparty if fuel prices fell below specified floors or strike prices in the hedge contracts. Crude oil peaked at approximately $145 per barrel in July 2008 and subsequently fell to around $45 per barrel in December 2008. The hedge contract prices at which UAL was required to make payments to its counterparties were well above $45 per barrel, resulting in significant losses on the hedge contracts.  

47  

Table of Contents [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Salaries and related costs decreased $533 million, or 12%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to UALs reduced workforce in 2009 compared to 2008. UAL had approximately 43,700 average full-time equivalent employees for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 49,600 for the year ended December 31, 2008. A $73 million decrease in severance expense related to UALs operational plans and a $92 million year-over-year benefit due to changes in employee benefit expenses also contributed to the decrease in salaries and related costs. Salaries and related costs also decreased by $46 million due to UALs Success Sharing Program. UAL did not record any expense for this plan in 2009. Partially offsetting these benefits were the impacts of average wage and benefit cost increases and a $38 million increase related to on-time performance bonuses paid to operations employee groups during 2009, which were not paid in 2008.  

The increase in regional capacity purchase expense of 10% in 2009 as compared to 2008 is consistent with the 11% increase in regional capacity during the same period.  

Landing fees and other rent increased $57 million, or 6%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to higher rates.  

During 2009, aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased by $131 million, or 12%, as compared to the prior year primarily due to a lower volume of engine and airframe maintenance repairs as a result of Uniteds early retirement of 100 aircraft from its operating fleet and the timing of maintenance on other fleet types.  

Distribution expenses decreased $176 million, or 21%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to lower passenger revenues on lower traffic and yields driving reductions in commissions, credit card fees and GDS fees. UAL also implemented several operating cost savings programs for both commissions and GDS fees which produced realized savings in 2009.  

Aircraft rent expense decreased by $63 million, or 15%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily as a result of UALs retirement of its entire fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft, some of which were financed through operating leases.  

UALs other operating expenses decreased $376 million, or 13%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. This decrease was primarily due to cost savings initiatives and lower variable costs associated with a 9.7% decrease in mainline capacity. In addition, other operating expenses decreased due to a reduction in maintenance cost of sales, which was due to lower sales of engine maintenance services.  

Asset Impairments and Special Charges.  

See Operating Expenses2010 compared to 2009, above, for a discussion of 2009 impairments and special items. In 2008, UAL performed impairment tests of its goodwill, all intangible assets and certain of its long-lived assets (principally aircraft pre-delivery deposits, aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts) due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred. As a result of this impairment testing, UAL recorded asset impairment charges of $2.6 billion. See Critical Accounting Policies and Note 4 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional information.  

48  

Table of Contents 

In addition, lease termination and other charges of $25 million were recorded during 2008 which primarily relate to the accrual of future rents for the Boeing 737 leased aircraft that were removed from service and charges associated with the return of certain of these aircraft to their lessors.  

See Note 21 to the financial statements in Item 8 for further information regarding these special items.  

Nonoperating Income (Expense).  

2010 compared to 2009   

The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in UALs nonoperating income (expense) (in millions except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The increase in interest expense in 2010 as compared to 2009, excluding the Merger impact, was primarily due to higher interest rates on average debt outstanding in 2010 as compared to comparable rates on average debt outstanding in 2009, as certain of the Companys recent financings have terms with higher interest rates as compared to debt that has been repaid. The higher interest rates were due to distressed capital markets and the Companys credit and liquidity outlook at the time of the financings.  

In 2010, miscellaneous, net included a gain of $21 million from the distribution to United of the remaining United Series 2001-1 enhanced equipment trust certificate (EETC) assets upon repayment of the note obligations. In addition, miscellaneous, net included $10 million of hedge ineffectiveness gains in 2010 on fuel hedge contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges, as compared to $31 million of fuel hedge gains in 2009. The fuel hedge gains in 2009 resulted from hedge contracts that were not designated as cash flow hedges, as further discussed below under 2009 compared to 2008.   

2009 compared to 2008  

The following table illustrates the year-over-year dollar and percentage changes in UALs nonoperating income (expense) (in millions, except percentage changes):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

49  

Table of Contents 

Nonoperating expenses decreased by $478 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily due to a $559 million improvement in net fuel hedge gains and losses, partially offset by a $93 million decrease in interest income due to lower investment yields as a result of decreased market rates.  

As described in the discussion of changes in aircraft fuel expense above, prior to April 1, 2010, UAL did not designate any of its fuel hedges as cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards. UAL had a significant amount of hedges that it did not consider economic hedges and classified the related hedge losses in miscellaneous nonoperating expense. As noted above, the significant losses in 2008 were due to significant fuel price declines below the contractual prices in UALs fuel hedge portfolio that existed during and at the end of 2008. The Companys fuel derivative gain in 2009 was less significant compared to 2008 because the Company did not have any significant derivative activity for hedges that are classified in miscellaneous, net, in 2009, other than settlement of contracts that existed at December 31, 2008, and there was less fuel price volatility in 2009 as compared to 2008. See Note 13 to the financial statements in Item 8 for further information related to fuel hedges.  

Income Taxes.  

In 2010, UAL recorded a tax benefit of $11 million related to the impairment of its Brazil routes, offset by $12 million of state and other income tax expense. The tax benefits recorded in 2009 and 2008 are related to the impairment and sale of certain indefinite-lived intangible assets, partially offset by the impact of an increase in state tax rates. Excluding these items, the effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the following: change in valuation allowance, expenses that are not deductible for federal income tax purposes and state income taxes. UAL is required to provide a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities because management has concluded that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets ultimately will not be realized. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional information.  

United and ContinentalResults of Operations2010 Compared to 2009  

During the fourth quarter of 2010, United and Continental changed their classification of certain revenue and expense items. Historical amounts have been reclassified for comparability. See Note 1 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional information related to these reclassifications.  

Uniteds and Continentals Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been abbreviated pursuant to General Instruction I(2)(a) of Form 10-K.

United had a net income of $399 million in 2010 as compared to a net loss of $628 million in 2009. Excluding the impact of the Merger on UALs results of operations, Uniteds results of operations were consistent with the UAL results discussed above. Prior to the Merger, United was UALs only significant operating subsidiary. As compared to 2009, Uniteds consolidated revenue increased $3.3 billion, or 20%, to $19.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. This increase was primarily due to improved economic conditions in 2010 which drove higher fares. As discussed above, in 2010, United increased consolidated capacity only by approximately 1% due to the weak economic conditions in 2009 and 2008. Uniteds increase in consolidated passenger volume was consistent with this increase in capacity.  

Uniteds operating expenses increased approximately $2.2 billion in 2010 as compared to 2009, which was primarily due to the following:  

       An increase of approximately $1.5 billion in aircraft fuel expense, which was primarily driven by increased market prices for aircraft fuel, as highlighted in the fuel table in Operating Expenses2010 compared to 2009, above;  

       An increase of $293 million in salaries and related costs, which was primarily due to increased accruals for profit sharing and other annual incentive plans. In 2010, Uniteds profit sharing expense was $165 million. Expense for the plan was not accrued in 2009 as the profit sharing and other incentive plan payout expenses were not earned based on UALs adjusted pre-tax losses;  

       An $86 million, or 13%, increase in distribution expenses due to increased passenger volumes and higher ticket fares;  

       A $158 million increase in merger-related costs and special charges, primarily due to $363 million of costs associated with the Merger and the integration of United and Continental, as discussed above. In 2009, United incurred significant special charges associated with its fleet reduction plan. See Note 21 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional details regarding merger-related costs and special charges; and  

       Other operating expenses included a $65 million payment due to the revenue sharing obligations related to the trans-Atlantic joint venture with Lufthansa and Air Canada.  

Uniteds nonoperating expense increased $123 million, or 24%, in 2010 as compared to 2009, which was primarily due to the increased cost of debt financing as a result of distressed capital markets during 2008 and

 2009. Uniteds interest expense is consistent with UALs interest expense, excluding the Merger impact discussed above, except for approximately $21 million of interest expense in 2010 from UALs $345 million of 6% Senior Convertible Notes due 2029 that were not issued by United.  

Continental  

The table below presents the Continental Successor and Predecessor periods in 2010. The combined presentation for the year ended December 31, 2010 does not represent a GAAP presentation. Management believes that the combined non-GAAP results provide a more meaningful comparison to the full year 2009. Continentals operating income and net income in the combined 2010 period were $698 million and $346 million, respectively, as compared to operating and net losses of $144 million and $282 million, respectively, in 2009. This improvement was largely due to the improvement in global economic conditions following the severe recession in 2009, consistent with the improvement in UALs results described above.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total revenues increased 14% in the combined 2010 period, as compared to 2009, primarily due to higher passenger fares, which were driven by improving global economic conditions and an increased demand for air travel.  

In the combined 2010 period, aircraft fuel expense increased 13% as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in fuel prices. Fuel hedge losses were $9 million and $380 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Continentals fuel purchase cost, without hedge impacts, increased approximately 27% in 2010 as compared to 2009, which is relatively consistent with UALs unhedged cost of fuel summarized in the tables above.  

Salaries and related costs increased 6% in the combined 2010 period as compared to 2009. The significant factors contributing to the increase in 2010 were profit sharing and related taxes of $77 million, variable incentive compensation and annual employee wage increases.  

52  

Table of Contents 

Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs decreased 11% in the combined 2010 period as compared to 2009 primarily due to the timing of maintenance events and savings from renegotiated rates on certain contracts.  

Continentals depreciation and amortization expense increased in the combined 2010 period as compared to 2009 primarily due to increased expense in the Successor period associated with recording Continentals assets at fair value as of the Merger closing date.  

Distribution expenses increased 17% in the combined 2010 period as compared to 2009, which was primarily due to increases in ticket volumes and prices, as some distribution expenses are price-based and some are volume-based.  

Aircraft rent decreased 8% in the combined 2010 period as compared to 2009 primarily due to the amortization of a lease fair value adjustment which was recorded as part of acquisition accounting.  

During the fourth quarter of 2010, Continental recorded $65 million to other operating expense due to the revenue sharing obligations related to the trans-Atlantic joint venture with Lufthansa and Air Canada for the first three quarters of 2010.  

Merger-related costs and special charges in the combined 2010 period included $230 million of merger-related expenses due to costs associated with the Merger and integration of United and Continental, as discussed above. Aircraft-related charges of $89 million in 2009 included $31 million of non-cash impairments on Boeing 737-300 and 737-500 aircraft and related assets, $39 million of other aircraft-related charges and $19 million of losses related to subleasing regional jets. See Note 21 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional discussion of merger-related costs and special charges.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources.  

As of December 31, 2010, UAL had $8.7 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which is $5.6 billion higher than at December 31, 2009 primarily due to the Merger impact. At December 31, 2010, UAL also had $388 million of restricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which is primarily collateral for estimated future workers compensation claims, credit card processing contracts, letters of credit and performance bonds. We may be required to post significant additional cash collateral to meet such obligations in the future. Restricted cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2009 totaled $341 million. United has a $255 million revolving commitment under its Amended Credit Facility, maturing in February 2012, of which $253 million and $254 million had been used for letters of credit as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Unless this facility is renewed or replaced, these letters of credit will likely be replaced with cash collateral. In addition, under a separate agreement, United had a $150 million unused line of credit as of December 31, 2010.  

As is the case with many of our principal competitors, we have a high proportion of debt compared to our capital. We have a significant amount of fixed obligations, including debt, aircraft leases and financings, leases of airport property and other facilities and postretirement medical and pension obligations. At December 31, 2010, UAL had approximately $15.4 billion of debt and capital lease obligations. In addition, we have substantial non-cancelable commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of new aircraft and related spare engines.  

As of December 31, 2010 a substantial portion of the Companys assets, principally aircraft, spare engines, aircraft spare parts, route authorities and certain other intangible assets were pledged under various loan and other agreements. See Note 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on assets provided as collateral by the Company. The Company has limited undrawn lines of credit and most of our otherwise readily financeable assets are encumbered. The global economic recession severely disrupted the global capital

 markets, resulting in a diminished availability of financing and a higher cost for financing that was obtainable. Although access to the capital markets has improved, as evidenced by our recent financing transactions, we cannot give any assurances that we will be able to obtain additional financing or otherwise access the capital markets in the future on acceptable terms (or at all). We must sustain our profitability and/or access the capital markets to meet our significant long-term debt and capital lease obligations and future commitments for capital expenditures, including the acquisition of aircraft and related spare engines.  

The following is a discussion of UALs sources and uses of cash from 2008 to 2010. As UAL applied the acquisition method of accounting to the Merger, UALs cash activities discussed below include Continental activities only after October 1, 2010.  

Cash Flows from Operating Activities.  

2010 compared to 2009  

UALs cash from operating activities increased by $941 million in 2010, as compared to 2009. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased cash from passenger and cargo services. Higher cash operating expenses, including fuel, distribution costs and interest expense, partially offset the benefit from increased revenues. Net cash required for fuel increased in the 2010 period due to higher aircraft fuel prices, as shown in the fuel expense table in Results of OperationsOperating Expenses2010 Compared to 2009, above. Operating cash flows in the 2009 period included the receipt of $160 million related to the future relocation of UALs Chicago OHare cargo facility.  

2009 compared to 2008  

UALs cash from operating activities increased by $2.2 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008. This improvement was partly due to decreased cash required for aircraft fuel purchases as consolidated fuel purchase costs decreased by $4.1 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008. Decreases in UALs fuel hedge collateral requirements also provided operating cash of approximately $955 million in 2009, as compared to a use of cash of $965 million in 2008. In addition, UAL received $160 million during 2009 related to the future relocation of its Chicago OHare cargo facility.  

These operating cash flow benefits were partially offset by a decrease in operating cash flow due to decreased revenues, which decreased by $3.9 billion in 2009. In addition, UAL did not have a significant advance sale of miles in 2009 resulting in an unfavorable variance as compared to 2008, during which UAL received $600 million from its advanced sale of miles and license agreement with its co-branded credit card partner, as discussed below.  

Cash Flows from Investing Activities.  

2010 compared to 2009  

UALs capital expenditures were $371 million and $317 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Included in UALs capital expenditures are Continentals capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2010. In addition to cash capital expenditures, UALs asset additions include Continentals acquisition of three Boeing 737 aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2010. The proceeds of the EETC financing in the fourth quarter of 2010 (described below) were directly issued to the aircraft manufacturers; therefore, these proceeds are not presented as capital expenditures and financing proceeds in the statements of consolidated cash flows. UAL limited its spending in both 2010 and 2009 by focusing its capital resources only on its highest-value projects.  

In 2009, United received $175 million from three sale-leaseback agreements. These transactions were accounted for as capital leases, resulting in an increase to capital lease assets and capital lease obligations during 2009.  

54  

Table of Contents 

2009 compared to 2008  

The sale of $2.3 billion of short-term investments throughout 2008 generated significant investing cash flows in 2008 as compared to 2009. As discussed below, these investments were sold as part of UALs shift to invest available cash into money market funds. UALs capital expenditures, which included capitalized interest, were $317 million and $475 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures decreased significantly in the 2009 period as compared to 2008 because the Company acquired only one aircraft in 2009, as compared to ten aircraft acquired during 2008. The 2009 and 2008 aircraft acquisitions were completed pursuant to existing lease terms using pre-funded lease deposits, as described below in Cash Flows from Financing Activities below.  

In 2009, United received $175 million from three sale-leaseback agreements, described above. The 2008 period included proceeds of $274 million from one sale-leaseback transaction. Other asset sales, including airport slot sales, generated proceeds of $77 million and $94 million during 2009 and 2008, respectively.  

Cash Flows from Financing Activities.  

Significant financing events in 2010 were as follows:  

       In January 2010, United issued $500 million of 9.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2013 and $200 million of 12.0% Senior Second Lien Notes due 2013, which are secured by Uniteds route authority to operate between the United States and Japan and beyond Japan to points in other countries, certain airport takeoff and landing slots and airport gate leaseholds utilized in connection with these routes.  

       In January 2010, United issued the remaining $1.3 billion in principal amount of the equipment notes relating to the Series 2009-1 and 2009-2 EETCs. Issuance proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion were used to repay the Series 2000-2 and 2001-1 EETCs and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.  

       In December 2010, Continental issued approximately $427 million of Class A and Class B pass-through certificates through two pass-through trusts. In December 2010, using proceeds from the issuance of the pass-through certificates, Continental issued equipment notes relating to five currently owned aircraft, resulting in proceeds of approximately $90 million to be used for general corporate purposes. Also in December 2010, Continental issued equipment notes resulting in $98 million of proceeds that were used to purchase three new Boeing 737 aircraft. The proceeds used to purchase the three new Boeing 737 aircraft were accounted for as a noncash investing and financing activity. In 2011, Continental expects to receive $239 million in net proceeds from the issuance of equipment notes, of which $142 million relates to seven currently owned aircraft and will be used for general corporate purposes, and of which $97 million will be used to acquire three additional new Boeing 737 aircraft.  

       In 2010, United acquired six aircraft through the exercise of its lease purchase options. Aircraft lease deposits of $236 million provided financing cash that was primarily utilized by United to make the final payments due under these capital lease obligations.  

Significant financing events in 2009 for UAL and United were as follows:  

       $322 million from multiple financings by United that are secured by certain aircraft spare parts, aircraft and spare engines;  

       $345 million from UALs issuance of 6% Senior Convertible Notes due 2029 (the 6% Senior Convertible Notes);  

       $161 million from Uniteds partial issuance of equipment notes related to the Series 2009-1 and Series 2009-2 EETCs described above in 2010 financing activities; and  

55  

Table of Contents 

       $222 million in net proceeds from the issuance of UAL common stock, consisting of $90 million from the completion of UALs equity offering program that began in 2008 and $132 million, net of fees, from the issuance of 19.0 million shares of UAL common stock in an underwritten public offering for a price of $7.24 per share.  

The proceeds from these transactions were partially offset by $984 million used for scheduled long-term debt and capital lease payments during 2009, as well as $49 million used for payment of various costs associated with the financing activities above.  

2008 Activity  

UAL used $253 million for its special distribution to common stockholders (United issued a $257 million dividend to UAL for this distribution) and $919 million for scheduled long-term debt and capital lease payments. United used cash of $109 million in connection with an amendment to its Amended Credit Facility, as further discussed below. In 2008, United acquired ten aircraft that were being operated under existing leases. These aircraft were acquired pursuant to existing lease terms. Aircraft lease deposits of $155 million provided financing cash that was primarily utilized by United to make the final payments due under these lease obligations.  

United completed a $241 million credit agreement secured by 26 of Uniteds currently owned and mortgaged Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft. Borrowings under the agreement were at a variable interest rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a margin. The agreement requires periodic principal and interest payments through its final maturity in June 2019. United may not prepay the loan prior to July 2012.  

United also entered into an $84 million loan agreement secured by three aircraft, including two Airbus A320 aircraft and one Boeing 777 aircraft.  

UAL generated net proceeds of $107 million in 2008 related to the $200 million equity offering program described above in the 2009 financing activities.  

See Cash Flows from Investing Activities, above, for a discussion of Uniteds 2008 sale-leaseback transactions.  

For additional information regarding these matters and other liquidity events, see Notes 5, 14 and 15 to the financial statements in Item 8.  

Credit Ratings. As of the filing date of this report, UAL, United and Continental had the following corporate credit ratings:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

These credit ratings are below investment grade levels. Downgrades from these rating levels, among other things, could restrict the availability and/or increase the cost of future financing for the Company.  

Other Liquidity Matters  

Below is a summary of additional liquidity matters. See the indicated notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 for additional details related to these and other matters affecting our liquidity and commitments.  

56  

Table of Contents [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Debt Covenants. Certain of the Companys financing agreements impose certain operating and financial covenants, as applicable, on the Company, on United and its material subsidiaries, or on Continental and its subsidiaries. Among other covenants, the Amended Credit Facility requires UAL, United and certain of Uniteds material subsidiaries who are guarantors under the Amended Credit Facility to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) of $1.0 billion at all times; a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations (that may increase if a specified dollar value of the route collateral is released); and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.0 for twelve month periods measured at the end of each calendar quarter. Among other covenants, the indentures governing the Senior Notes require the issuer to maintain a minimum ratio of collateral value to debt obligations. If the value of the collateral underlying that issuers Senior Notes declines such that the issuer no longer maintains the minimum required ratio of collateral value to debt obligations, the issuer may be required to pay additional interest at the rate of 2% per annum, provide additional collateral to secure the noteholders lien or repay a portion of the Senior Notes. A breach of certain of the covenants or restrictions contained in the Amended Credit Facility or indentures governing the Senior Notes could result in a default and a subsequent acceleration of the applicable debt obligations. In addition, the indentures governing the United Senior Notes contain a cross-acceleration provision pursuant to which a default resulting in the acceleration of indebtedness under the Amended Credit Facility would result in a default under such indentures. A default under the indentures governing the United Senior Notes could allow holders of the United Senior Notes to accelerate the maturity of the obligations in these agreements.  

Credit Card Processing Agreements. United and Continental have agreements with financial institutions that process customer credit card transactions for the sale of air travel and other services. Under certain of Uniteds and Continentals credit card processing agreements, the financial institutions either require, or under certain circumstances have the right to require, that United and Continental maintain a reserve equal to a portion of advance ticket sales that have been processed by that financial institution, but for which United and Continental have not yet provided the air transportation.  

As of December 31, 2010, United and Continental provided a reserve of $25 million each, as required under their respective credit card processing agreements with JPMorgan Chase and affiliates of JPMorgan Chase. Additional reserves may be required under these or other credit card processing agreements of United or Continental in certain circumstances, such as decreases in credit ratings, decreases in Uniteds or Continentals unrestricted cash balance below amounts required by the processing agreements, or decreases in minimum ratios of unrestricted cash to current liabilities. In addition, in certain circumstances, an increase in the future reserve requirements as provided by the terms of one or more of Uniteds and Continentals material credit card processing agreements could materially reduce the Companys liquidity. See Note 17 to the financial statements in Item 8 for a detailed discussion of the obligations under the Companys credit card processing agreements.  

Capital Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Companys business is capital intensive, requiring significant amounts of capital to fund the acquisition of assets, particularly aircraft. In the past, the Company has funded the acquisition of aircraft through outright purchase, by issuing debt, by entering into capital or operating leases, or through vendor financings. The Company also often enters into long-term lease commitments with airports to ensure access to terminal, cargo, maintenance and other required facilities.

Table of Contents 

The table below provides a summary of UALs material contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 (in millions):  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Long-term debt presented in UALs financial statements is net of a $261 million debt discount which is being amortized over the debt terms. Contractual payments are not net of the debt discount. Contractual long-term debt includes $101 million of non-cash obligations as these debt payments are made directly to the creditor by a company that leases three aircraft from United. The creditors only recourse to United is repossession of the aircraft.  

 (b) Includes interest portion of capital lease obligations of $116 million in 2011, $98 million in 2012, $92 million in 2013, $81 million in 2014, $64 million in 2015 and $288 million thereafter. Future interest payments on variable rate debt are estimated using estimated future variable rates based on a yield curve.  

 (c) Represents our estimates of future minimum noncancelable commitments under our capacity purchase agreements and does not include the portion of the underlying obligations for aircraft and facility rent that is disclosed as part of aircraft and nonaircraft operating leases. Amounts also exclude a portion of Uniteds capital lease obligation recorded for certain of its capacity agreements. See Note 15 to the financial statements in Item 8 for the significant assumptions used to estimate the payments.  

 (d) Amounts represent postretirement benefit payments, net of subsidy receipts, through 2020. Benefit payments approximate plan contributions as plans are substantially unfunded.  

 (e) Represents estimate of the minimum funding requirements as determined by government regulations. Amounts are subject to change based on numerous assumptions, including the performance of assets in the plan and bond rates. See Critical Accounting Policies, below, for a discussion of our assumptions regarding UALs pension plans.  

 (f) Represents contractual commitments for firm order aircraft and spare engines only, net of previously paid purchase deposits, and noncancelable commitments to purchase goods and services, primarily information technology support. See Note 17 to the financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of our purchase commitments.  

Contingencies.  

Contingent Senior Unsecured Notes. UAL would be obligated under an indenture to issue to the PBGC up to $500 million aggregate principal amount of 8% Notes if certain financial triggering events occur. The 8% Notes would be issued to the PBGC in up to eight equal tranches of $62.5 million (with each tranche issued no later than 45 days following the end of any applicable year). A triggering event occurs when UALs EBITDAR (as defined in the PBGC indenture) exceeds $3.5 billion over the prior twelve months ending June 30 or December 31 of any applicable fiscal year. The twelve-month measurement periods will end with the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. In certain circumstances, UAL common stock may be issued in lieu of the issuance of the 8% Notes. A financial triggering event has not yet occurred under this indenture.

Legal and Environmental. The Company has certain contingencies resulting from litigation and claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Management believes, after considering a number of factors, including (but not limited to) the information currently available, the views of legal counsel, the nature of contingencies to which the Company is subject and prior experience, that the ultimate disposition of the litigation and claims will not materially affect the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. The Company records liabilities for legal and environmental claims when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. The amounts of these liabilities could increase or decrease in the near term, based on revisions to estimates relating to the various claims.  

Many aspects of the Companys operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state and local laws protecting the environment. Future environmental regulatory developments, such as climate change regulations in the U.S. and abroad, could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry. There are certain laws and regulations relating to climate change that apply to the Company, including the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) (which is subject to legal challenge), environmental taxes for certain international flights (including the United Kingdoms Air Passenger Duty and Germanys departure ticket tax), limited greenhouse gas reporting requirements, and the State of Californias cap and trade regulations (which impacts Uniteds San Francisco Maintenance Center and co-located cogeneration plant). In addition, there are land-based planning laws that could apply to airport expansion projects, requiring a review of greenhouse gas emissions, and could affect airlines in certain circumstances.  

In 2009, the EU issued a directive to member states to include aviation in its greenhouse gas ETS, which required the Company to begin monitoring emissions of carbon dioxide effective January 1, 2010. Beginning in 2012, the ETS would require the Company to ensure it has obtained sufficient emission allowances equal to the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from flights to and from EU member states with such allowances then surrendered on an annual basis to the government. In December 2009, the Air Transportation Association, joined by United, Continental and American Airlines, filed a lawsuit in the United Kingdom challenging regulations that transpose into UK law the EU ETS as applied to U.S. carriers. In addition, non-EU countries are considering filing a formal challenge before the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) with respect to the EUs inclusion of non-EU carriers. If the scheme is found to be valid, it could significantly increase the cost of carriers operating in the EU (by requiring the purchase of carbon credits), although the precise cost to the Company is difficult to calculate with certainty due to a number of variables. Those potential costs will depend, among other things, on the baseline carbon emissions yet to be determined by the EU, the Companys future carbon emissions from flights to and from the EU, and the price of carbon credits.  

In addition to current regulatory programs, there is also the potential for additional climate change regulation. In 2010, the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that current and projected concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere threaten the public health and welfare. Although legal challenges have been initiated and legislative proposals are expected that may invalidate this endangerment finding (and/or the EPAs assertion of authority under the Clean Air Act), the finding could result in EPA regulation of commercial aircraft emissions.  

In addition, the ICAO recently signaled through an ICAO Assembly Resolution that it will be developing a regulatory scheme for aviation greenhouse gas emissions. There could be other regulatory actions taken in the future by the U.S. government, state governments within the U.S., foreign governments, or through a separate United Nations global climate change treaty to regulate the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation industry, which could result in multiple schemes applying to the same emissions. The precise nature of any such requirements and their applicability to the Company are difficult to predict, but the financial impact to the Company and the aviation industry would likely be adverse and could be significant, including the potential for increased fuel costs, carbon taxes or fees, or a requirement to purchase carbon credits.  

The Company believes that it will have no financial exposure for claims arising out of the events of September 11, 2001 in light of the provisions of the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of

 2001, the resolution of the majority of the wrongful death and personal injury cases by settlement and the withdrawal of all related proofs of claim from UAL Corporations Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and the limitation of claimants recoveries to insurance proceeds.  

Other Contingencies. United is a party to a multiyear technology services agreement and has engaged in discussions with the counterparty to amend or restructure certain performance obligations. In the event that these discussions are not successful, the counterparty may assert claims for damages. The ultimate outcome of these discussions and the exact amount of the damages and costs, if any, to the Company cannot be predicted with certainty at this time.  

For further details on these and other matters, see Note 17 in Item 8.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. An off-balance sheet arrangement is any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has (1) made guarantees, (2) a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets, (3) an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or (4) any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support, or that engages in leasing, hedging or research and development arrangements. The Companys primary off-balance sheet arrangements include operating leases, which are summarized in the contractual obligations table in Capital Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, above, and certain municipal bond obligations, as discussed below. In addition, United has $253 million of letters of credit issued under its Amended Credit Facility at December 31, 2010. Continental had letters of credit and performance bonds relating to various real estate, customs and aircraft financing obligations at December 31, 2010 in the amount of $73 million. The Continental letters of credit and performance bonds have expiration dates through December 2014.  

Certain municipalities have issued municipal bonds on behalf of each of United and Continental to finance the construction of improvements at airport-related facilities. United and Continental also each lease facilities at airports where municipal bonds funded at least some of the construction of airport-related projects. As of December 31, 2010, United guaranteed interest and principal payments of $270 million in principal amount of Denver International Airport bonds (Denver Bonds) which are due in 2032, unless United elects not to extend its equipment and ground lease in which case the bonds are due in 2023. The outstanding bonds and related guarantee for Denver are not recorded in Uniteds financial statements because the related lease agreement is accounted for as an operating lease with the associated rent expense recorded on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term through 2032. The annual lease payments through 2023 and the final payment for the principal amount of the Denver Bonds are included in the operating lease payments in the contractual obligations table in Capital Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, above.  

As of December 31, 2010, Continental is the guarantor of approximately $1.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of tax-exempt special facilities revenue bonds and interest thereon, excluding the US Airways contingent liability described below. These bonds, issued by various airport municipalities, are payable solely from Continentals rentals paid under long-term agreements with the respective governing bodies. The leasing arrangements associated with approximately $1.5 billion of these obligations are accounted for as operating leases, and the leasing arrangements associated with approximately $190 million of these obligations are accounted for as capital leases.  

Continental is contingently liable for US Airways obligations under a lease agreement between US Airways and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey related to the East End Terminal at LaGuardia. These obligations include the payment of ground rentals to the Port Authority and the payment of other rentals in respect of the full amounts owed on special facilities revenue bonds issued by the Port Authority having an outstanding par amount of $95 million at December 31, 2010 and a final scheduled maturity in 2015. If US Airways defaults on these obligations, Continental would be obligated to cure the default and would have the right to occupy the terminal after US Airways interest in the lease had been terminated.

Increased Cost Provisions. In the Companys financing transactions that include loans, the Company typically agrees to reimburse lenders for any reduced returns with respect to the loans due to any change in capital requirements and, in the case of loans in which the interest rate is based on LIBOR, for certain other increased costs that the lenders incur in carrying these loans as a result of any change in law, subject in most cases to certain mitigation obligations of the lenders. At December 31, 2010, UAL had $3.3 billion of floating rate debt (consisting of Uniteds $2.3 billion and Continentals $1.0 billion of floating rate debt) and $483 million of fixed rate debt (consisting of Uniteds $233 million and Continentals $250 million of fixed rate debt), with remaining terms of up to ten years, that are subject to these increased cost provisions. In several financing transactions involving loans or leases from non-U.S. entities, with remaining terms of up to ten years and an aggregate carrying value of $3.7 billion (consisting of Uniteds $2.6 billion and Continentals $1.1 billion of carrying value), we bear the risk of any change in tax laws that would subject loan or lease payments thereunder to non-U.S. entities to withholding taxes, subject to customary exclusions.  

Fuel Consortia. The Company participates in numerous fuel consortia with other carriers at major airports to reduce the costs of fuel distribution and storage. Interline agreements govern the rights and responsibilities of the consortia members and provide for the allocation of the overall costs to operate the consortia based on usage. The consortia (and in limited cases, the participating carriers) have entered into long-term agreements to lease certain airport fuel storage and distribution facilities that are typically financed through tax-exempt bonds (either special facilities lease revenue bonds or general airport revenue bonds), issued by various local municipalities. In general, each consortium lease agreement requires the consortium to make lease payments in amounts sufficient to pay the maturing principal and interest payments on the bonds. As of December 31, 2010, approximately $1.2 billion principal amount of such bonds were secured by significant fuel facility leases in which UAL participates, as to which UAL and each of the signatory airlines have provided indirect guarantees of the debt. UALs contingent exposure is approximately $276 million principal amount of such bonds based on its recent consortia participation. As of December 31, 2010, Uniteds and Continentals contingent exposure related to these bonds, based on its recent consortia participation, was approximately $212 million and $64 million, respectively. The Companys exposure could increase if the participation of other carriers decreases. The guarantees will expire when the tax-exempt bonds are paid in full, which range from 2011 to 2040. The Company did not record a liability at the time these indirect guarantees were made.  

United and ContinentalCash Flow Activities2010 Compared to 2009  

United  

Operating Activities  

Uniteds cash from operating activities increased by $819 million in 2010, as compared to 2009. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased cash from passenger and cargo services. Higher cash operating expenses, including fuel, distribution costs and interest expense, partially offset the benefit from increased revenues. Net cash required for fuel increased in the 2010 period due to higher aircraft fuel prices. Operating cash flows in the 2009 period included the receipt of $160 million related to the future relocation of UALs Chicago OHare cargo facility.  

Investing Activities  

Uniteds capital expenditures were $318 million and $317 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. United limited its spending in both 2010 and 2009 by focusing its capital resources only on its highest-value projects. In 2009, United received $175 million from three sale-leaseback agreements. These transactions were accounted for as capital leases, resulting in an increase to capital lease assets and capital lease obligations during 2009.  

Financing Activities  

Uniteds significant financing activities in 2010 and 2009 are described in Cash Flows from Financing Activities, above, in this Item 7.

Continental  

Operating Activities  

Continentals cash from operating activities increased by $1.0 billion in the combined 2010 period, as compared to 2009. This year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased cash from passenger and cargo services. Higher cash operating expenses, including fuel and distribution costs, partially offset the benefit from increased revenues.  

Investing Activities  

Continentals capital expenditures were $300 million and $381 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. In addition, Continental acquired aircraft in both 2010 and 2009 with proceeds from financings that were delivered directly to the manufacturer. See Note 18 to the financial statements in Item 8 for information related to these non-cash financing and investing activities.  

In the combined 2010 period, cash used for purchases of short-term investments was $273 million, as compared to cash provided from sales of short-term investments of $180 million in 2009. This year-over-year variance was primarily due to investment of higher cash balances.  

Financing Activities  

Significant financing activities in 2010 and 2009 included the following:  

       In December 2010, Continental issued approximately $427 million of Class A and Class B pass-through certificates through two pass-through trusts. See the discussion above in Cash Flows from Financing Activities in this Item 7 for further information related to this financing.  

       In August 2010, Continental issued $800 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Secured Notes due 2015. In conjunction with the issuance of these notes, Continental repaid its $350 million senior secured term loan credit facility that was due in June 2011. See Note 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional information related to this financing.  

       In November 2009, Continental obtained financing for eight currently-owned Boeing aircraft and eleven new Boeing aircraft through an EETC financing, which included $528 million aggregate principal amount of Class A certificates that bear interest at 7.25% and $117 million aggregate principal amount of Class B certificates that bear interest at 9.25%. The obligation for this financing was recorded as debt in 2010 when the aircraft were delivered. The financing requires periodic principal and interest payments with final payments due in 2019 in the case of the Class A certificates and final payments due in 2017 in the case of the Class B certificates.  

       In December 2009, Continental issued $230 million in principal amount of 4.5% Convertible Notes due 2015. See Note 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional details related to this financing.  

       In August 2009, Continental completed a public offering of 14 million shares of Class B common stock at a price to the public of $11.20 per share, raising net proceeds of $158 million for general corporate purposes.  

       In July 2009, Continental obtained financing for 12 currently owned Boeing aircraft and five new Boeing aircraft through a $390 million EETC financing, which bears interest at 9%. The proceeds of the financing were used for general corporate purposes and to acquire new aircraft.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are affected by significant judgments and uncertainties which potentially could result in materially different accounting under different assumptions and conditions. The Company has prepared the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results could differ  

62  

Table of Contents 

 from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following critical accounting policies that impact the preparation of the financial statements.  

Passenger Revenue Recognition. The value of unused passenger tickets and miscellaneous charge orders (MCOs) is included in current liabilities as advance ticket sales. The Company records passenger ticket sales and tickets sold by other airlines for use on United and Continental as passenger revenues when the transportation is provided or upon estimated breakage. The Company records an estimate of breakage revenue for tickets that will expire in twelve months without usage at departure date. The Company records an estimate of tickets that have been used, but not recorded as revenue due to system processing errors, as revenue in the month of sale based on historical results. Due to complex industry pricing structures, refund and exchange policies and interline agreements with other airlines, certain amounts are recognized as revenue using estimates both as to the timing of recognition and the amount of revenue to be recognized. These estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results.  

Tickets sold by other airlines are recorded at the estimated values to be billed to the other airlines. Non-refundable tickets generally expire on the date of the intended flight, unless the date is extended by notification from the customer on or before the intended flight date. Fees charged in association with changes or extensions to non-refundable tickets are recorded as other revenue at the time the fee is collected. Change fees related to non-refundable tickets are considered a separate transaction from the air transportation because they represent a charge for the Companys additional service to modify a previous sale. Therefore, the pricing of the change fee and the initial customer reservation are separately determined and represent distinct earnings processes. Refundable tickets expire after one year. MCOs can be exchanged for a passenger ticket. The Company estimates the amount of MCO breakage revenue based on historical experience.  

See Note 3 to the financial statements in Item 8 for additional information related to accounting standards impacting revenue recognition that have been issued, but not yet adopted by the Company.  

Frequent Flyer Awards. United and Continental have loyalty programs to increase customer loyalty. Program participants earn mileage credits (miles) by flying on United, Continental and certain other participating airlines. Program participants can also earn miles through purchases from other non-airline partners that participate in the Companys loyalty programs. We sell miles to these partners, which include retail merchants, credit card issuers, hotels and car rental companies, among others. Miles can be redeemed for free, discounted or upgraded air travel and non-travel awards. The Company records its obligation for future award redemptions using a deferred revenue model.  

In the case of the sale of air services, the Company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as revenue when the air transportation occurs and defers a portion of the ticket sale that represents the fair value of the miles, as described further below. In the case of miles sold to third parties there are two revenue elements: marketing and air transportation, as described below.  

Marketing-related element. In addition to selling miles for future redemption, the Company may also provide marketing services with the sale of miles, which, depending on the particular customer, may include advertising and branding services, access to the program member list and other services. The amount of revenue from the marketing-related element is determined by subtracting the estimated fair value of the miles earned or future transportation element from the total proceeds. The residual portion of the sales proceeds related to marketing activities is recorded as other operating revenue when earned.  

Air transportation element. The Company defers the portion of the sales proceeds that represents the estimated fair value of the air transportation and recognizes that amount as revenue when transportation is provided. The fair value of the air transportation component is determined based upon the equivalent ticket value of similar Company fares and amounts paid to other airlines for air transportation. The initial revenue deferral is recorded as frequent flyer deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheets. The revenue related to the air transportation component is recorded as passenger revenue.  

63  

Table of Contents 

The value of miles is estimated assuming redemptions on the Company and other participating carriers in the loyalty programs and by estimating the relative proportions of awards to be redeemed by class of service within broad geographic regions of the Companys operations. This estimate also includes the cost of redemption on other airlines and the cost of certain other awards. The estimation of the fair value of each award mile requires the use of several significant assumptions, for which significant management judgment is required. For example, management must estimate how many miles are projected to be redeemed on its airline, versus on other airlines. Since the equivalent ticket value of miles redeemed on the Company and on other carriers can vary greatly, this assumption can materially affect the calculation of the weighted-average ticket value from period to period. Management uses historical customer redemption patterns as the best single indicator of future redemption behavior in making its estimates, but changes in customer redemption behavior to patterns which are not consistent with historical behavior may result in material changes to deferred revenue balances and to recognized revenue.  

The Company measures its deferred revenue obligation using all awarded and outstanding miles, regardless of whether the customer has accumulated enough miles to redeem an award. Some of these sold and awarded miles will never be redeemed by program members, which we refer to as breakage. UAL reviews its breakage estimates annually based upon the latest available information regarding redemption and expiration patterns. Prior to January 1, 2010, UAL and United recognized revenue related to expected expired miles over the estimated redemption period. The Companys estimate of the expected expiration of miles requires significant management judgment. Current and future changes to expiration assumptions or to the expiration policy, or to program rules and program redemption opportunities, may result in material changes to the deferred revenue balance as well as recognized revenues from the programs. For example, various program rule differences exist between the United and Continental programs. One such difference is for the expiration of miles, as under Uniteds program miles expire after eighteen months of inactivity, whereas miles do not expire under Continentals program. Although Continentals program does not cancel accounts for inactivity, Continental records breakage revenue by estimating that a portion of the miles will never be redeemed based on statistical analysis of several years of sales and redemptions of miles.  

During the first quarter of 2010, United obtained additional historical data, previously unavailable, which enabled it to refine its estimate of the amount of breakage in its population of miles. This new data enables United to identify historical differences between certain of its breakage estimates and the amounts that have actually been experienced more accurately. As a result, United increased its estimate of the number of miles expected to expire. In conjunction with this change in estimate, United also adopted a change to the accounting methodology used to recognize breakage. Both the change in estimate and methodology have been applied prospectively effective January 1, 2010. The new accounting method recognizes breakage as a component of the weighted average redemption rate on actual redemptions as compared to Uniteds prior method which recognized a pool of breakage dollars over an estimated redemption period. United believes that this is a preferable change to the accounting methodology for breakage because breakage will be recognized as a component of the rate at which actual miles are redeemed.  

UAL and United estimate these changes increased passenger revenue by approximately $250 million, or $1.21 per UAL basic share ($0.99 per UAL diluted share), in the year ended December 31, 2010.  

The following table summarizes information related to the Companys frequent flyer deferred revenue:

Asset Impairments. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, UAL performed interim and annual impairment tests of its intangible assets, including goodwill and certain of its long-lived assets, principally aircraft and related spare engines and spare parts. UAL tested its indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, on an annual basis. In addition, UAL performed additional tests due to events and changes in circumstances that indicated an impairment might have occurred. Certain factors deemed by management to have constituted a potential impairment triggering event were a significant decline in actual and forecasted revenues, the planned removal from UALs fleet of 100 aircraft, and a significant decrease in the fair value of UALs outstanding equity and debt securities, including a decline in UALs market capitalization to significantly below book value, among others.  

UAL recorded impairment charges of $165 million, $243 million and $2.6 billion during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The impairment charge in 2008 included a $2.3 billion goodwill impairment.  

Discussed below is the methodology used for each type of asset impairment:  

Aircraft Asset Impairments  

All of UALs aircraft impairments during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were due to aircraft that were grounded or planned to be grounded or aircraft that were not operated by UAL. The aircraft impairments primarily related to Uniteds Boeing 737 fleet, which it completely removed from service, and five of its Boeing 747 aircraft, which it removed from service as part of Uniteds capacity reduction plans, which were initiated in 2008. Fair value was estimated using the market approach. Asset appraisals, published aircraft pricing guides and recent transactions for similar aircraft were considered by United in its market value determination. Several impairments of the Boeing 737 and 747 aircraft occurred from 2008 to 2010 due to the weak economy and reduced demand for these particular aircraft, among other factors.  

In addition to the Boeing 737 and 747 aircraft, in 2009, UAL tested five of its owned regional jets, which were leased to a third party, for impairment due to a weak market for these aircraft and a remaining lease term of approximately one year. As a result of this testing, UAL recorded impairment charges of $19 million to record the regional aircraft at estimated fair value as of December 31, 2009.  

Due to the unfavorable economic and industry factors described above, UAL also determined in 2008 that it was required to perform an impairment test of its $105 million of pre-delivery aircraft deposits and related capitalized interest. UAL determined that these aircraft deposits were completely impaired and wrote off their full carrying value as UAL believed that it was highly unlikely that it would take these future aircraft deliveries and, therefore, United would be required to forfeit the deposits, which were not transferable based on existing contract terms.  

Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets  

UAL performs an annual impairment test of its indefinite-lived intangible assets on October 1 of each year and performs interim impairment tests of these assets throughout the year if events and changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment might have occurred.  

In 2010, UAL recorded a $29 million impairment of its Brazil routes primarily due to the recent open skies agreement between the U.S. and Brazil which, once enacted, may result in a decrease in revenue from these routes. The valuation of the Brazil routes is based on an income methodology using estimated future cash flows from operation of the routes.  

65  

Table of Contents 

In 2009, using an income methodology which was based on estimated future cash flows, United recorded impairment charges of $150 million to decrease the carrying value of its tradename. The most significant impact on the estimated fair value was a significant decrease in actual and forecasted revenues due to the poor global economic conditions.  

In 2008, UAL recorded a $64 million impairment charge to indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily codeshare agreements).  

In 2008, UAL estimated the fair value of the mainline reporting unit (to which all goodwill is allocated) utilizing several fair value measurement techniques, including two market estimates and one income estimate, and using relevant data available. The market approach is a valuation technique in which fair value is estimated based on observed prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for similar assets. The valuation process is essentially that of comparison and correlation between the subject asset and other similar assets. The income approach is a technique in which fair value is estimated based on the cash flows that an asset could be expected to generate over its useful life, including residual value cash flows. These cash flows are discounted to their present value equivalents using a rate of return that accounts for the relative risk of not realizing the estimated annual cash flows and for the time value of money.  

Under the market approaches, the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was estimated based upon the fair value of invested capital for UAL, as well as a separate comparison to revenue and EBITDAR multiples for similar publicly traded companies in the airline industry. The fair value estimates using both market approaches included a control premium similar to those observed for historical airline and transportation company market transactions.  

Under the income approach, the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was estimated based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows for UAL. The income approach is dependent on a number of critical management assumptions including estimates of future capacity, passenger yield, traffic, operating costs (including fuel prices), appropriate discount rates and other relevant assumptions. The Company estimated its future fuel-related cash flows for the income approach based on the five-year forward curve for crude oil as of May 31, 2008. The impacts of the Companys aircraft and other tangible and intangible asset impairments were considered in the fair value estimation of the mainline reporting unit.  

Taking into consideration an equal weighting of the two market estimates and the income estimate, which has been UALs practice when performing annual goodwill impairment tests, the indicated fair value of the mainline reporting unit was less than its carrying value, and therefore, UAL was required to perform additional goodwill impairment testing. For this testing, UAL determined the implied fair value of goodwill of the mainline reporting unit by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the mainline reporting unit, including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets, as if the mainline reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the mainline reporting unit was the acquisition price. As a result of this testing, UAL determined that goodwill was completely impaired and therefore recorded an impairment charge to write-off the full value of goodwill.  

Accounting for Long-Lived Assets. The net book value of operating property and equipment for UAL was $16.9 billion and $9.8 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The assets recorded value is impacted by a number of accounting policy elections, including the estimation of useful lives and residual values and, when necessary, the recognition of asset impairment charges.  

The Company records assets acquired, including aircraft, at acquisition cost. Depreciable life is determined through economic analysis, such as reviewing existing fleet plans, obtaining appraisals and comparing estimated lives to other airlines that operate similar fleets. Older generation aircraft are assigned lives that are generally consistent with the experience of United and Continental and the practice of other airlines. As aircraft technology has improved, useful life has increased and the Company has generally estimated the lives of those aircraft to be  

66  

Table of Contents 

 30 years. Residual values are estimated based on historical experience with regard to the sale of both aircraft and spare parts and are established in conjunction with the estimated useful lives of the related fleets. Residual values are based on current dollars when the aircraft are acquired and typically reflect asset values that have not reached the end of their physical life. Both depreciable lives and residual values are revised periodically to recognize changes in the Companys fleet plan and other relevant information. A one year increase in the average depreciable life of UALs flight equipment would reduce annual depreciation expense on flight equipment by approximately $36 million.  

Benefit Accounting. Uniteds obligations with respect to defined benefit pension plans were substantially eliminated in 2006 as most of the United defined benefit plans were assumed by the PBGC as part of UAL Corporations emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. UALs pension obligations increased significantly in 2010 due to UALs assumption of Continental obligations in the Merger. Under applicable accounting guidance, pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods. UAL only began recognizing the impact of Continentals plans in its financial statements beginning on October 1, 2010.  

UALs plans under-funded status was $1.5 billion at December 31, 2010, of which $1.4 billion is attributed to Continentals plans. Funding requirements for tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined by government regulations. We estimate that our minimum funding requirements for the Continental plans during calendar year 2011 is approximately $126 million. The fair value of the plans assets was $1.9 billion at December 31, 2010, of which $1.7 billion is attributed to assets of Continentals plans. 

The following discussion relates only to the Continental plans, as the United plans are not significant to UALs total obligations.  

When calculating pension expense for 2011, Continental assumed that its plans assets would generate a long-term rate of return of 7.75%. The expected long-term rate of return assumption was developed based on historical experience and input from the trustee managing the plans assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets, which is based on a goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels. Our projected long-term rate of return is slightly higher than some market indices due to the active management of our plans assets, and is supported by the historical returns on our plans assets. The plans strive to have assets sufficiently diversified so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio. We regularly review actual asset allocation and the pension plans investments are periodically rebalanced to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate.  

The defined benefit pension plans assets consist primarily of equity and fixed-income securities held through common collective trusts. Equity securities include investments in large-cap and small-cap companies. Fixed-income securities include corporate bonds of companies in diversified industries and asset and mortgage-backed securities. Investments in equity securities and fixed-income securities are commingled funds valued at the unit of participation value of shares held by the plans trusts. The private equity funds invest primarily in common stock of companies in diversified industries and in buyout, venture capital and special situation funds. Investments in private equity funds are valued at the net asset value of shares held by the plans trusts at year end. The allocation of assets was as follows at December 31, 2010:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

67  

Table of Contents 

Pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases. When calculating pension expense for 2011, we will assume that our plans assets will generate a weighted-average long-term rate of return of 7.75%. Lowering the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by an additional 50 basis points (from 7.75% to 7.25%) would increase UALs estimated 2011 pension expense by approximately $8 million.  

Future pension obligations for the Continental plans were discounted using a weighted average rate of 5.52% at December 31, 2010. UAL determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. This approach can result in different discount rates for different plans, depending on each plans projected benefit payments. The pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced. Lowering the discount rate by 50 basis points (from 5.52% to 5.02%) would increase the pension liability at December 31, 2010 by approximately $290 million and increase the estimated 2011 pension expense by approximately $36 million.  

Future changes in plan asset returns, plan provisions, assumed discount rates, pension funding law and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities. We cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future.  

Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting. Uniteds postretirement plan provides certain health care benefits, primarily in the U.S., to retirees and eligible dependents, as well as certain life insurance benefits to certain retirees reflected as Other Benefits. Continentals retiree medical programs permit retirees who meet certain age and service requirements to continue medical coverage between retirement and Medicare eligibility. Eligible employees are required to pay a portion of the costs of their retiree medical benefits, which in some cases may be offset by accumulated unused sick time at the time of their retirement. Plan benefits are subject to co-payments, deductibles and other limits as described in the plans.  

The Company accounts for other postretirement benefits by recognizing the difference between plan assets and obligations, or the plans funded status, in its financial statements. Under GAAP, other postretirement benefit expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods and is generally calculated independently of funding decisions or requirements. The Company has not been required to pre-fund its current and future plan obligations, which has resulted in a significant net obligation, as discussed below.  

UALs benefit obligation was $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion for the other postretirement benefit plans at December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The year-over-year increase is due to Continental plan obligations assumed by UAL in the Merger, as well as changes in the assumptions used to value the obligation for Uniteds plan, such as the decrease in the discount rate.  

The calculation of other postretirement benefit expense and obligations requires the use of a number of assumptions, including the assumed discount rate for measuring future payment obligations and the health care cost trend rate. UAL determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due. UALs weighted average discount rate to determine its benefit obligations as of December 31, 2010 was 5.13%, as compared to 5.69% for December 31, 2009. The health care cost trend rate assumed by United and Continental for 2010 was 8.5% and 7.5%, respectively, as compared to assumed trend rates for 2011 of 8.0% and 7.5%, respectively. A 1.0% increase/(decrease) in assumed health care trend rates would increase/(decrease) UALs total service and interest cost for the year ended December 31, 2010 by $20 million/($16 million), respectively. Detailed information regarding the Companys other postretirement plans, including key assumptions, is included in Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this report.  

Actuarial gains or losses are triggered by changes in assumptions or experience that differ from the original assumptions. Under the applicable accounting standards, those gains and losses are not required to be recognized currently as other postretirement expense, but instead may be deferred as part of accumulated other comprehensive  

68

 income and amortized into expense over the average remaining service life of the covered active employees. The Companys accounting policy is to not apply the corridor approach available under applicable GAAP with respect to amortization of amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income. Under the corridor approach, amortization of any gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income is required only if, at the beginning of the year, the accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of assets. If amortization is required, the minimum amount outside the corridor divided by the average remaining service period of active employees is recognized as expense. The corridor approach is intended to reduce volatility of amounts recorded in pension expense each year. Since the Company has elected not to apply the corridor approach, all gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income are amortized to expense over the remaining years of service of the covered active employees. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, UAL had unrecognized actuarial gains of $24 million and $155 million, respectively, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income for its other postretirement benefit plans.  

Business Combination Measurements. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, UAL estimated the fair value of Continentals assets and liabilities as of the closing date of the Merger, October 1, 2010. These fair value measurements did not result in gains or losses, but were instead an input to the calculation of goodwill related to the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Continental in the Merger. Additional changes in the fair values of these assets and liabilities from the current estimated values, as well as changes in other assumptions, could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill.  

The fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market, income and cost approaches. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market other than for derivative financial instruments and certain long-term debt assumed in the Merger. The market approach, which indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets, was utilized to estimate the fair value of Continentals aircraft and operating leases. The market approach used by the Company included prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable assets, as well as pricing guides and other sources. We considered the current market for the aircraft, the maintenance condition of the aircraft and the expected proceeds from the sale of the assets, among other factors. We also utilized the market approach to value certain intangible assets such as airport take-off and landing slots when sufficient market information was available. The income approach was primarily used to value intangible assets, including the frequent flyer database, international route authorities, alliances, the Continental logo and tradename, and certain airport take-off and landing slots. The income approach indicates value for a subject asset based on the present value of cash flows projected to be generated by the asset. Projected cash flows are discounted at a required market rate of return that reflects the relative risk of achieving the cash flows and the time value of money. The cost approach, which estimates value by determining the current cost of replacing an asset with another of equivalent economic utility, was used, as appropriate, for certain assets for which the market and income approaches could not be applied due to the nature of the asset. The cost to replace a given asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost for the asset, less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation.  

The fair value of Continentals pension and postretirement plans was determined by measuring the plans funded status as of the Merger closing date. Any excess projected benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets was recognized as a liability. One of the significant assumptions in determining the projected benefit obligation is the discount rate. We determined the appropriate discount rate for each of the plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due, which resulted in a discount rate of 5.2% for pension plans and 4.6% for postretirement plans. Other significant assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age, and mortality assumptions. These assumptions are discussed further in Note 9 to the financial statements in Item 8.

The fair value of Continentals OnePass frequent flyer program liability was determined based on the weighted average equivalent ticket value of outstanding miles at October 1, 2010 that were expected to be redeemed. The weighted-average equivalent ticket value reflects differing classes of service, domestic and international itineraries and the carrier providing the award travel. See the Frequent Flyer Awards critical accounting policy above for additional information.
