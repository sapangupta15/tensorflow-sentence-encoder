Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

CSX does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Historically, the Company has used derivative financial instruments to address market risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and the risk of volatility in its fuel costs. 

At December 2012, CSX had $25 million of floating rate debt obligations outstanding. A 1% fluctuation in interest rates on these notes would cause less than a $1 million change in interest expense. This amount was determined by considering the impact of a hypothetical interest rate fluctuation on the balances of our floating rate debt at December 28, 2012.
