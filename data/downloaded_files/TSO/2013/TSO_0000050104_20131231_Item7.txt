BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OVERVIEW

Strategy and Goals

Our vision is to create a safer and cleaner future as efficient providers of reliable transportation fuel solutions. To achieve these goals we are pursuing the following strategic priorities:

•improve operational efficiency and effectiveness by focusing on safety and reliability, system improvements and cost leadership;

•drive commercial excellence by strengthening our supply, trading and optimization activities to provide additional value to the business; 

•maintain our financial position by exercising capital discipline and focusing on a balanced use of free cash flow;

•capture value-driven growth through a focus on our logistics assets, growing our marketing business and other strategic opportunities accretive to shareholder value; and

•maintain a high performing culture by building leadership at all levels of the organization with employees from diverse backgrounds and experiences who are accountable for delivering on our commitments.

Our goals during 2013 were focused on these strategic priorities, and we accomplished the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 37
During 2014, we plan to continue to focus on our strategic priorities described above by:

•delivering the improved California synergies, resulting from our acquisition and integration of the Southern California refining, marketing and logistics business;

•enhancing gross margin through an increased focus on sourcing advantaged crude oil for our West Coast operations;

•continuing to improve our base business by maintaining high refinery availability and utilization rates and continuing efforts to enhance productivity;

•focusing on growing our logistics business and increasing third-party revenue; and

•maintaining strong financial discipline by focusing on our capital position and a balanced use of our free cash flow.

Tesoro Logistics LP

TLLP was formed to own, operate, develop and acquire logistics assets to gather crude oil and distribute, transport and store crude oil and refined products. Tesoro Logistics GP, LLC (“TLGP”), a 100% consolidated subsidiary, serves as the general partner of TLLP. We owned an approximate 36% interest in TLLP at December 31, 2013, including an approximate 2% general partner interest. In 2013, 87% of TLLP’s revenue was derived from us primarily under various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements that generally include minimum volume commitments.

TLLP intends to continue to expand its business through organic growth, including constructing new assets and increasing the utilization of existing assets, and by acquiring assets from us and third parties. Although we have historically operated our logistics assets primarily to support our refining and marketing business, we intend to grow the logistics operations to maximize the integrated value of assets within the midstream and downstream value chain. We believe TLLP is well positioned to achieve its primary business objectives and execute business strategies based on its:

•long-term fee-based contracts;

•relationship with us;

•assets positioned in the high demand Williston Basin; and 

•financial flexibility.

As the owner of the general partner of TLLP, the organic and third-party growth strategy discussed above will directly benefit us by optimizing the value of our assets within the midstream and downstream value chain. This includes creating shareholder value through the lower cost of capital available to TLLP as a limited partnership and receipt of TLLP’s quarterly distributions. As the distributions per unit increase, our proportion of the total distribution will grow at an accelerated rate due to our incentive distribution rights.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

Los Angeles Acquisition 

We acquired BP’s integrated Southern California refining, marketing and logistics business (the “Los Angeles Acquisition”) on June 1, 2013. The acquired assets include the 266 Mbpd Carson refinery located adjacent to our Wilmington refinery, related marine terminals, land terminals and pipelines. The assets also include the ARCO® brand and associated registered trademarks, as well as a master franchisee license for the ampm® convenience store brand and the supply rights to approximately 835 branded dealer-operated and branded wholesale stations in central and southern California, Nevada and Arizona. Additionally, we acquired an anode coke calcining operation and a 51% ownership in the Watson cogeneration facility, both located at the Carson refinery.

The final purchase price of these assets was $2.33 billion, including petroleum and non-hydrocarbon inventories of $1.1 billion. We expect to realize significant operational synergies from the Los Angeles Acquisition through the integrated crude oil supply, enhanced optimization of intermediate feedstocks and product distribution costs, improvements in light product yields and reductions in manufacturing costs and stationary source air emissions.

 38
BP West Coast Products, LLC and other affiliated sellers (the “Sellers”) retained certain obligations, responsibilities, liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of the pre-closing operations of the assets upon closing of the Los Angeles Acquisition. We assumed certain obligations, responsibilities, liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of or incurred in connection with decrees, orders and settlements the Sellers entered into with governmental and non-governmental entities prior to closing. We also assumed certain environmental liabilities, currently estimated to be $170 million as of the date of acquisition, primarily related to remediation obligations. See Note B and Note S to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding the acquisition and environmental liabilities.

Immediately subsequent to the closing of the Los Angeles Acquisition, TLLP acquired from us six marketing and storage terminals located in southern California (the “Los Angeles Terminal Assets”) for total consideration of $640 million. TLLP acquired the majority of the remaining logistics assets (the “Los Angeles Logistics Assets”) initially acquired by us as part of the Los Angeles Acquisition, for total consideration of $650 million effective December 6, 2013. The Los Angeles Logistics Assets, located near our Los Angeles refinery, include two marine terminals, over 100 miles of an active crude oil and refined products pipeline system connecting our Los Angeles refining complex with the acquired marine terminal facilities and the Los Angeles Terminal Assets, dedicated crude oil and refined products storage terminals, a petroleum coke handling and storage facility, and a refined products terminal. In connection with TLLP’s acquisitions of the Los Angeles Terminal Assets and Los Angeles Logistics Assets, we retained all of the liabilities assumed in the Los Angeles Acquisition to cleanup and monitor the environmental conditions existing prior to the date of each acquisition.

Northwest Product System Acquisition

TLLP completed its acquisition of Chevron Pipe Line Company’s (“Chevron”) northwest products system (the “Northwest Products System”) for a purchase price of approximately $355 million on June 19, 2013. The Northwest Products System consists of a regulated common carrier products pipeline running from Salt Lake City, Utah to Spokane, Washington and a jet fuel pipeline to the Salt Lake City International Airport (the “Northwest Products Pipeline”) and three refined products terminals in Idaho and Washington. In accordance with the amended sale and purchase agreements, Chevron retained financial and operational responsibility for a period of two years to remediate the site of a diesel fuel release that occurred on the Northwest Products Pipeline on March 18, 2013, in addition to paying any monetary fines and penalties assessed by any government authority arising from this incident. TLLP assumed responsibility for all other environmental contingencies. There was $13 million remaining of the environmental liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition of the Northwest Products System, including those obligations related to the diesel fuel release that were not indemnified by Chevron as of December 31, 2013. 

Hawaii Business

On September 25, 2013, we completed the sale of all of our interest in Tesoro Hawaii, LLC, which operated a 94 thousand barrel per day (“Mbpd”) Hawaii refinery, retail stations and associated logistics assets (the “Hawaii Business”). We received gross proceeds of $539 million, including $75 million from the sale of assets and $464 million from the sale of inventory and other net working capital. Additional contingent consideration includes an earnout arrangement payable over three years for an aggregate amount of up to $40 million based on future gross margins. Any income related to the earnout arrangement will not be recorded until it is considered realizable. We have also agreed to indemnify the purchaser for up to $15 million of environmental remediation costs related to the Hawaii Business, subject to limitations described in the purchase agreement. We recognized a gain of approximately $81 million, including the gain on the sale of the Hawaii Business and a $17 million curtailment gain related to the remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as a result of the sale of the Hawaii Business.

Equity Issuances

TLLP closed an equity offering of 9,775,000 common units representing limited partner interest, at a public offering price of $41.70 per unit on January 14, 2013. Net proceeds to TLLP from the sale of the units were approximately $392 million and were used primarily to fund TLLP’s acquisition of the Northwest Products System. In connection with the offering, TLGP purchased 199,490 general partner units at a price of $41.70 per unit to maintain its 2% general partner interest in TLLP.

 39
TLLP closed an equity offering of 6,300,000 common units representing limited partner interest, at a public offering price of $51.05 per unit on November 22, 2013. Net proceeds to TLLP from the sale of the units were approximately $310 million and were used to fund a portion of the Los Angeles Logistics Assets Acquisition.

Joint Venture

We entered into an equally owned joint venture effective April 22, 2013 with Savage Companies to construct, own and operate a unit train unloading and marine loading terminal at the Port of Vancouver, Washington. The construction of the terminal is subject to approval by regulatory agencies. The Port of Vancouver’s Board of Commissioners has approved the ground lease related to this project. The project will allow for the delivery of cost-advantaged North American crude oil to the U.S. West Coast. We expect our portion of the initial investment in the project will be between $50 million and $75 million. The facility, which is expected to be operational in late 2014 or early 2015, is designed to accommodate various grades of North American crude oil and handle an estimated initial volume of 120 Mbpd with potential near-term expansion capability up to 300 Mbpd. We are in the process of developing commercial agreements and an administrative service agreement related to the joint venture and intend to commit to the first 60 Mbpd of throughput at the facility. 

As part of our strategy to deliver cost-advantaged North American crude oil to the West Coast, we have ordered additional rail cars with an expected mid-2014 delivery. We expect to have adequate U.S.-flag marine capabilities to execute the strategy.

Industry Overview

Our profitability is heavily influenced by the cost of crude oil and the aggregate value of the products we make from that crude oil and is affected by changes in economic conditions and supply and demand balance. Product values and crude oil costs are set by the market and are outside of the control of independent refiners. The following charts illustrate average benchmark refined product differentials relevant to our markets.

Average Mid-Continent benchmark diesel and gasoline fuel margins were down 19% and 34%, respectively, in 2013, as compared to 2012. Average U.S. West Coast benchmark gasoline fuel margins were down 14%, in 2013, as compared to 2012, while average U.S. West Coast benchmark diesel fuel margins remained relatively flat. 

The following chart illustrates average benchmark crude oil pricing relevant to our markets.

Average Crude Oil Prices ($/bbl)

Source: PLATTS

Our Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest refineries continue to benefit from processing crude oil from inland U.S. and Canada, much of which is influenced by the price of West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude oil. This benefit is a result of discounts on the price of this crude oil compared to the crude oil processed at our other coastal refineries, much of which is benchmarked against Brent crude oil (“Brent”). The WTI discount to Brent, averaged $11 per barrel during 2013, compared to over $17 per barrel during 2012. 

 41
We supplied our North Dakota refinery primarily with Bakken crude oil, our Washington refinery primarily with Bakken crude oil and Canadian Light Sweet crude oil and our Utah refinery with light sweet crude oil from Wyoming and Colorado, as well as Uinta Basin waxy crude oil during 2013. The average discount of Bakken crude oil to WTI remained flat at about $5 per barrel in 2013, compared to 2012. The average discount of Canadian Light Sweet crude oil to WTI increased to approximately $8 per barrel during 2013 compared to an average discount of $7 per barrel during 2012. 

Our California refineries run a significant amount of South American heavy crude oil (“Oriente”), San Joaquin Valley Heavy (“SJVH”) and light crude oil from Iraq (“Basrah”), which continued to be priced at a discount to Brent throughout 2013.

Product Supply and Demand Factors

There are long-term factors, in addition to current market conditions, that may impact the supply and demand of refined products in the U.S. including:

•world crude oil prices; 

•increased federal fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles;

•increased volumes of renewable fuels, mandated by the Energy Independence and Security Act;

•various regulations of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary and mobile sources;

•potential enactment of federal climate change legislation; and

•possible promulgation of national regulations relative to gasoline composition and ozone standards.

 42
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

A discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below. The accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8, together with the following information, are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance. 

 Our results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include results of operations of the assets acquired in the Los Angeles Acquisition from the date of acquisition. In addition, the refining segment and California region operating highlights for the year ended December 31, 2013 include the results of the Carson refinery from the date of acquisition. We are integrating our Wilmington and Carson refineries and refer to the combined facility as the Los Angeles refinery. Additionally, the retail segment results for the year ended December 31, 2013 include the results of operations for the retail assets acquired as part of the Los Angeles Acquisition from the date of acquisition. The results of any assets acquired in the Los Angeles Acquisition that were subsequently purchased by TLLP are included in the operating results of the TLLP segment from the date of acquisition.

As of December 31, 2013, we began reporting the logistics assets and operations of TLLP as a separate operating segment. In previous periods, when certain quantitative thresholds had not been met, TLLP’s assets and operations were presented within our refining operating segment. TLLP’s assets and operations include certain crude oil gathering assets and crude oil and refined products terminalling and transportation assets acquired from Tesoro and third parties. The historical results of operations of these assets have been retrospectively adjusted to conform to current presentation. These adjustments resulted in lower gross refining margins. The refining segment now includes costs for transportation and terminalling services provided by TLLP that were previously eliminated with consolidated reporting of TLLP revenues within our refining segment results.

The TLLP financial and operational data presented include the historical results of all assets acquired from Tesoro prior to the acquisition dates. The acquisitions from Tesoro were transfers between entities under common control. Accordingly, the financial information of TLLP contained herein has been retrospectively adjusted to include the historical results of the assets acquired in the acquisitions from Tesoro prior to the effective date of each acquisition for all periods presented. The TLLP financial data is derived from the combined financial results of the TLLP predecessor (the “TLLP Predecessor”), TLLP’s predecessor for accounting purposes and the combined consolidated financial results of TLLP for the period beginning April 26, 2011, the date TLLP commenced operations. The TLLP Predecessor includes the financial results of the initial net assets acquired from Tesoro during the initial public offering through April 25, 2011. We refer to the TLLP Predecessor and, prior to each acquisition date, the acquisitions from Tesoro collectively, as “TLLP’s Predecessors”. 

On September 25, 2013, we completed the sale of the Hawaii Business. We have reflected its results of operations as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented, and, unless otherwise noted, we have excluded the Hawaii Business from the financial and operational data presented in the tables and discussion that follow. 

Our management uses a variety of financial and operating metrics to analyze operating segment performance. To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), our management uses additional metrics that are known as “non-GAAP” financial metrics in its evaluation of past performance and prospects for the future. These metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (“Adjusted EBITDA”). We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated earnings, including earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest, excluding net earnings (loss) from discontinued operations, before depreciation and amortization expense, net interest and financing costs, income taxes and interest income. 

We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe some investors and analysts use Adjusted EBITDA to help analyze our cash flows including our ability to satisfy principal and interest obligations with respect to our indebtedness and use cash for other purposes, including capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by some investors and analysts to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance and by management for internal analysis. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to U.S. GAAP net income or net cash from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, because it excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash from operating activities.

(a)For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA, see discussion above.

Our net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Tesoro Corporation in 2013 were $392 million ($2.85 per diluted share) compared with net earnings of $876 million ($6.20 per diluted share) in 2012. The decrease in net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Tesoro Corporation of $484 million, was primarily due to the following:

•a $5.92 per barrel decrease in gross refining margin per barrel, or 35%, in 2013 as compared to 2012, reflecting weaker industry gasoline and diesel margins in the Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest markets and lower discounts on advantaged crude oil. This decrease in margin per barrel resulted in a $385 million decline in the gross refining margin; and

•transaction and integration costs of $62 million related to the Los Angeles Acquisition and TLLP’s purchase of the Northwest Products System during 2013.

The decrease in net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Tesoro Corporation during 2013 relative to 2012 was partially offset by the following:

•a refund from the settlement of a rate proceeding from the CPUC of $54 million during 2013;

•expense of $28 million related to legal matters in 2012 compared to the release of a $16 million legal reserve as a result of the favorable settlement of litigation during 2013;

•a decrease in stock-based compensation charges of $20 million primarily related to a smaller increase in Tesoro’s stock price during 2013 as compared to 2012; and

•a decrease in interest and financing costs of $16 million primarily related to premiums paid and unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the debt refinancing during 2012. 

 45
Our net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Tesoro Corporation in 2012 were $876 million ($6.20 per diluted share) compared with $576 million ($4.02 per diluted share) in 2011. The increase in net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Tesoro Corporation of $300 million, was primarily due to the following:

•an increase in gross refining margins of $454 million driven by a strong margin environment and feedstock advantages in 2012;

•a $51 million impairment charge in 2011 related to a change in scope of a capital project at our Wilmington refinery; [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•a $34 million decrease in manufacturing costs primarily related to lower energy costs during 2012.

The increase in net earnings from continuing operations attributable to Tesoro Corporation during 2012 relative to 2011 was partially offset by the following:

•a $168 million increase in income tax expense in 2012 as compared to 2011 as a result of higher earnings during the year;

•a $59 million increase in stock and incentive-based compensation expense, primarily resulting from a significant increase in Tesoro’s stock price during 2012 as compared to 2011;

•$37 million of property and business interruption insurance recoveries related to the Washington refinery incident collected in 2011;

•expense of $28 million related to legal matters in 2012; and

•transaction and integration costs of $13 million related to the Los Angeles Acquisition, TLLP’s purchase of the Northwest Products System and various acquisitions of assets by TLLP from us during 2012.

(b)We define heavy crude oil as crude oil with an American Petroleum Institute gravity of 24 degrees or less.

(c)As of December 31, 2013, we began reporting the logistics assets and operations of TLLP, as a separate operating segment. In previous periods, TLLP’s assets and operations were presented within our refining operating segment. TLLP’s assets and operations include certain assets acquired from Tesoro and third parties. The TLLP financial and operational data presented include the historical results of all assets included in acquisitions from Tesoro prior to the acquisition dates. The historical results of operations of these assets have been retrospectively adjusted to conform to current presentation. These adjustments resulted in lower gross refining margins. The refining segment now includes costs for transportation and terminalling services provided by TLLP that were previously eliminated with consolidated reporting of TLLP revenues within our refining segment results.

(d)Management uses various measures to evaluate performance and efficiency, and to compare profitability to other companies in the industry, including gross refining margin per barrel, manufacturing costs before depreciation and amortization expense (“Manufacturing Costs”) per barrel and refined products sales margin per barrel. 

•Management uses gross refining margin per barrel to evaluate performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate gross refining margin per barrel; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate gross refining margin per barrel by dividing gross refining margin (revenues less costs of feedstocks, purchased refined products, transportation and distribution) by total refining throughput. 

•Management uses Manufacturing Costs per barrel to evaluate the efficiency of refining operations. There are a variety of ways to calculate Manufacturing Costs per barrel; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate Manufacturing Costs per barrel by dividing Manufacturing Costs by total refining throughput.

•Management uses refined product sales margin per barrel to evaluate the profitability of manufactured and purchased refined product sales. There are a variety of ways to calculate refined product sales margin per barrel; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate refined product sales margin per barrel by dividing refined product sales and refined product cost of sales by total refining throughput, and subtracting refined product cost of sales per barrel from refined product sales per barrel. 

Investors and analysts use these financial measures to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. These financial measures should not be considered alternatives to segment operating income, revenues, costs of sales, and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Refining Data by Region

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(h)We acquired the Carson refinery and related assets on June 1, 2013. The information presented includes the results of operations of these assets from the date of acquisition on June 1, 2013. We are integrating the operations of our Wilmington and Carson refineries and refer to the combined facility as the Los Angeles refinery.

2013 Compared to 2012

Overview. Operating income for our refining segment decreased by $841 million to $866 million from 2012 to 2013. The decrease is primarily due to lower gross refining margins driven by a reduction in feedstock advantages from narrowing crude oil discounts relative to industry benchmarks during 2013, and an increase in manufacturing costs mainly resulting from the Los Angeles Acquisition in 2013 as compared to 2012.

Gross Refining Margins. Our gross refining margin per barrel decreased by $5.92 per barrel, or 35%, to $11.19 per barrel in 2013 as compared to 2012, reflecting weaker industry gasoline and diesel margins in the Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest markets and lower discounts on advantaged crude oil. 

Total gross refining margin decreased by $385 million, or 12%, to $2.8 billion in 2013 as compared to 2012. The decrease is driven by lower industry margins during 2013. Gross refining margin in the Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest region decreased by $405 million and $321 million, respectively, and in the California region, increased by $338 million. The $338 million increase in gross refining margin at our California refineries was primarily attributable to additional throughput from the acquisition of the Carson refinery and a turnaround at our Martinez refinery during 2012. Lower throughput at our Washington and Utah refineries during 2013 also contributed to the decrease in gross refining margin. We were able to transport cost-advantaged Bakken crude oil, which continued to price at a discount to Alaska North Slope crude oil during 2013 to our Washington refinery via TLLP’s Anacortes rail facility; however, these feedstock advantages were offset by lower gasoline and diesel margins in the region as compared to 2012. 

Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput increased 180 Mbpd, or 35%, to 697 Mbpd in 2013 as compared to 517 Mbpd in 2012. The increase is primarily a result of higher throughput in the California region due to the June 1, 2013 acquisition of the Carson refinery. Throughput also increased at our North Dakota refinery during 2013 as a result of the refinery expansion completed in 2012 and from higher utilization rates at our Alaska and Martinez refineries in 2013 due to turnarounds in 2012. These increases were partially offset by lower throughput at our Washington and Utah refineries as a result of turnarounds in 2013. 

 49
Refined Product Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased $6.6 billion, or 23% to $35.0 billion in 2013 as compared to $28.3 billion in 2012, primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes as a result of the Los Angeles Acquisition, partially offset by lower average refined product sales prices. Total refined product sales volumes increased by 181 Mbpd, or 29%, to 808 Mbpd in 2013 as compared to 627 Mbpd in 2012. Refined product sales volumes were impacted by an increase in refining and marketing integration driven by the Los Angeles Acquisition in 2013 and the transition of additional retail sites during 2012. Our average product sales price decreased $5.24 per barrel, or 4%, to $118.40 per barrel in 2013 as compared to $123.64 per barrel in 2012. 

Cost of Sales and Expenses. Our average costs of sales decreased by $1.30 per barrel, or 1%, to $109.64 per barrel in 2013 as compared to $110.94 per barrel in 2012, reflecting slightly lower crude oil prices as compared to 2012. Manufacturing and other operating expenses increased by $414 million, or 36%, to $1.6 billion in 2013 due to higher throughput volumes at our Los Angeles refinery from the integration of assets acquired in the Los Angeles Acquisition and at our Martinez refinery due to a large turnaround in the first quarter of 2012. In addition, there were increases in repairs and maintenance expenses and natural gas costs, primarily at our California refineries. We recorded $16 million of business interruption insurance recoveries, which reduced cost of sales during 2013. There were no comparable insurance recoveries during 2012.

2012 Compared to 2011

Overview. Operating income for our refining segment increased by $501 million to $1.7 billion from 2011 to 2012. The increase is primarily due to increased gross refining margins driven by feedstock advantages from crude oil discounts relative to industry benchmarks during 2012.

Gross Refining Margins. Our gross refining margin per barrel increased by $2.13 per barrel, or 14%, to $17.11 per barrel in 2012 as compared to 2011, reflecting strong industry margins and lower crude oil cost relative to industry benchmarks in the Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest markets. Decreased crude oil costs for our Mid-Continent and Pacific Northwest refineries contributed to strong refining margins for these regions. Industry distillate and gasoline margins on the U.S. West Coast increased 7% and 35%, respectively, while industry distillate and gasoline margins in the Mid-Continent increased 12% and 13%, respectively during 2012. The significantly higher gross refining margin per barrel and increased throughputs in these regions positively impacted gross refining margins by $454 million in 2012 as compared to 2011. Total refinery utilization at our refineries was 90% in 2012 as compared to 89% in 2011.

Refining Throughput. Total refining throughput increased 9 Mbpd, or 2%, to 517 Mbpd in 2012 as compared to 508 Mbpd in 2011 primarily due to the expansion of our North Dakota refinery, which was completed during 2012 and higher throughputs at our Washington refinery as a result of favorable market conditions. The increase was partially offset by scheduled turnarounds at our Alaska refinery during 2012.

Refined Product Sales. Revenues from sales of refined products increased $2.3 billion, or 9% to $28.3 billion in 2012 as compared to $26.0 billion in 2011, primarily due to higher average refined product sales prices and increased refined product sales volumes. Our average product sales price increased $2.70 per barrel, or 2%, to $123.64 per barrel in 2012 as compared to $120.94 per barrel in 2011. Total refined product sales increased by 35 Mbpd, or 6%, to 627 Mbpd in 2012 as compared to 592 Mbpd in 2011. Refined product sales volumes were impacted by increased demand for diesel fuel and gasoline and additional branded marketing supply agreements.

Cost of Sales and Expenses. Our average costs of sales increased by $1.77 per barrel, or 2%, to $110.94 per barrel in 2012 as compared to $109.17 per barrel in 2011, reflecting slightly higher crude oil prices as compared to 2011. Manufacturing and other operating expenses increased by $2 million, from 2011 to 2012 as a result of increased throughput and catalyst costs during 2012. Additionally, we received $5 million in property insurance recoveries during 2011, which were recorded as a reduction to operating expenses, with no comparable insurance recoveries in 2012. The increase was partially offset by lower energy costs, primarily natural gas. Loss on asset disposals decreased to $13 million in 2012, as compared to $59 million in 2011. In 2011, we recorded a $51 million loss as a result of a change in scope of a capital project at our Wilmington refinery.

TLLP Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

____________________

(a)Includes historical results of TLLP’s Predecessors for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011. See additional information regarding TLLP’s Predecessors on page 43.

(b)Management uses average revenue per barrel to evaluate performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate average revenue per barrel; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate average revenue per barrel as revenue divided by the number of days in the period divided by throughput. Investors and analysts use this financial measure to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. This financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to segment operating income, revenues and operating expenses or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

(c)TLLP segment revenues from services provided to our refining segment were $265 million, $143 million and $77 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts are eliminated upon consolidation.

(d)TLLP segment operating expenses include amounts billed by Tesoro for services provided to TLLP under various operational contracts. These amounts totaled $27 million, $15 million and $27 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts are eliminated upon consolidation. TLLP segment third-party operating expenses related to the transportation of crude oil and refined products are reclassified to cost of sales in our statements of consolidated operations upon consolidation.

(e)TLLP segment general and administrative expenses include amounts charged by Tesoro for general and administrative services provided to TLLP under various operational and administrative contracts. These amounts totaled $18 million, $13 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts are eliminated upon consolidation.

2013 Compared to 2012

Operating Income. Operating income for our TLLP segment increased by $17 million, or 27%, to $81 million in 2013 as compared to $64 million in 2012, due to an increase in revenues, partially offset by higher operating and maintenance costs, which include TLLP Predecessors’ costs. Revenues increased by $148 million, or 94%, to $305 million in 2013 as compared to $157 million in 2012. This increase was driven by TLLP’s acquisitions of the Northwest Product System, the Los Angeles Logistics Assets, and the Los Angeles Terminal Assets in 2013, and the operation of the Anacortes rail facility acquired during 2012 for a full year. TLLP also had higher volumes on the crude oil gathering assets, which resulted in a $17 million increase in revenue during 2013 as compared to 2012.

 51
Operating expenses increased $87 million, or 138%, to $150 million in 2013 as compared to $63 million in 2012, primarily as a result of increased labor and operating costs associated with the operations of the Northwest Product System, the Los Angeles Logistics Assets, and the Los Angeles Terminal Assets acquired in 2013 and the Anacortes Rail Facility, acquired in 2012. Operating expenses also include the impact of TLLP Predecessors’ costs. TLLP also experienced higher costs in the crude oil gathering system associated with the higher throughput during 2013. Depreciation expense increased $30 million, or 231%, to $43 million in 2013 compared to $13 million in 2012 a result of the assets acquired in 2013. TLLP also incurred higher general and administrative expenses in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily as a result of increased overhead allocations and increased transaction and integration costs related to TLLP’s 2013 acquisitions.

2012 Compared to 2011

Operating Income. Operating income for our TLLP segment increased by $44 million, to $64 million in 2012 from $20 million in 2011. The increase is primarily related to an increase in revenues of $70 million, or 80%, to $157 million in 2012 as compared to $87 million in 2011. The increase was driven by new commercial agreements between Tesoro and TLLP that went into effect at the time of the initial public offering in April 2011 (“Initial Offering”) and TLLP’s 2012 acquisitions of our assets and includes an increase of $18 million from TLLP’s 2012 acquisitions. Increased utilization of TLLP’s assets resulted in higher system-wide throughput volumes in 2012. 

Operating expenses increased $16 million, or 34%, to $63 million in 2012 as compared to $47 million in 2011, primarily as a result of additional costs related to higher contract trucking volumes and higher repair and maintenance expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $7 million, or 78%, to $16 million in 2012 compared to $9 million in 2011. TLLP incurred higher general and administrative expenses as a result of increased overhead allocations related to additional resources utilized for management and growth of the TLLP assets and a full year of expense under the Second Amended and Restated Omnibus Agreement.

 52
Retail Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(a)Reflects the acquisition of supply rights for approximately 835 dealer-operated and branded wholesale retail stations with the Los Angeles Acquisition in 2013, and 49 retail stations from SUPERVALU, Inc. and the transition of 174 retail stations from Thrifty Oil Co. during 2012.

(b)Management uses fuel margin per gallon to compare profitability to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate fuel margin per gallon; different companies may calculate it in different ways. We calculate fuel margin per gallon by dividing fuel gross margin by fuel sales volumes. Investors and analysts use fuel margin per gallon to help analyze and compare companies in the industry on the basis of operating performance. This financial measure should not be considered an alternative to revenues, segment operating income or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Fuel margin and fuel margin per gallon include the effect of intersegment purchases from the refining segment at prices which approximate market.

2013 Compared to 2012

Operating Income. Operating income for our retail segment decreased $6 million, or 5%, to $120 million in 2013, as compared to $126 million in 2012, primarily as a result of lower fuel margin per gallon and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher total fuel sales volumes. Retail fuel margin per gallon decreased 43% to $0.12 per gallon in 2013 primarily due to lower industry gasoline margins from the acquisition of additional dealer-operated sites in 2013 in connection with the Los Angeles Acquisition. The addition of these dealer-operated sites changed the ratio of dealer to company-operated sites, which impacted fuel margins in 2013. These dealer-operated sites generate lower fuel margin per gallon than our other retail sites. 

 53
Total gross margin increased $54 million, or 12% to $489 million in 2013 compared to $435 million in 2012, which was primarily driven by higher fuel sales volumes. Fuel sales volumes increased 1.5 billion gallons, or 87%, to 3.2 billion gallons during 2013 as compared to 2012 reflecting higher average station count from the Los Angeles Acquisition in 2013 and transition of additional retail stations in the second half of 2012. Merchandise and other non-fuel gross margin also increased to $99 million during 2013 compared to $74 million in 2012 due to the higher average station count.

Fuel sales revenues increased $4.2 billion, or 71%, to $10.1 billion in 2013 as compared to $5.9 billion in 2012, reflecting higher average sales prices and increased fuel sales volumes as a result of higher average station count in 2013. Operating expenses increased $66 million, or 26%, to $318 million during 2013 as compared to $252 million in 2012. The increase is a result of expenses incurred to operate additional stations acquired and transitioned during the second half of 2012 and the second quarter of 2013. Our other expenses remained relatively consistent compared to 2012.

2012 Compared to 2011

Operating Income. Our retail segment operating income increased $39 million, or 45% to $126 million in 2012 as compared to $87 million in 2011. Higher retail industry fuel margins positively impacted operating income during 2012. Total gross margin increased $114 million, or 36%, to $435 million in 2012 compared to $321 million in 2011. Retail fuel margin per gallon increased 24% to $0.21 per gallon in 2012 causing fuel gross margins to increase $107 million from 2011. Additionally, fuel sales volumes increased by 212 million gallons, or 14%, increase in fuel sales volumes in 2012 as compared to 2011 reflecting additional volumes as a result of higher average station count from the acquisition and transition of additional retail stations in 2012. Merchandise and other non-fuel gross margin also increased by $7 million to $74 million during 2012 compared to $67 million in 2011 due to the higher average station count.

Fuel sale revenues increased $974 million, or 20%, to $5.9 billion in 2012 as compared to $4.9 billion in 2011, reflecting significantly higher average sales prices and increased fuel sales volumes as a result of higher average station count in 2012. Operating expenses increased $73 million, or 41%, to $252 million during 2012 as compared to $179 million in 2011, primarily due to additional expenses incurred to operate the stations acquired and transitioned in 2012. Our other expenses remained relatively consistent compared to 2011.

Consolidated Results of Operations

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $40 million, or 14%, to $337 million in 2013 from $297 million in 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to transaction and integration costs of $62 million related to the Los Angeles Acquisition and TLLP’s acquisition of the Northwest Products System during 2013. The increase was offset by lower stock-based compensation expense, which decreased by $20 million during 2013, as compared to 2012, primarily attributable to our stock appreciation rights. Our stock appreciation rights are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period using a Black-Scholes model where stock price is a significant assumption. Our stock price increased 33% during 2013 compared to an 89% increase during 2012. Other increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were driven by an increase in headcount during 2013 as compared to 2012.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $70 million or 31% to $297 million in 2012 from $227 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to a $54 million increase in stock and incentive-based compensation expense. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was driven by higher expense recorded for our stock appreciation rights and performance share awards, which are adjusted to fair value at the end of each reporting period, and increased by $34 million and $11 million, respectively. Additionally, we incurred transaction and integration costs of approximately $10 million related to the Los Angeles Acquisition and TLLP’s purchase of the Northwest Products System during 2012.

Interest and Financing Costs, Net. Net interest and financing costs decreased $16 million, or 10%, to $151 million in 2013 from $167 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by a $27 million charge for premiums paid and unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the redemption of our 6.625% Senior Notes and 6.500% Senior Notes in 2012. This reduction in expense was partially offset by interest expense on borrowings outstanding during 2013 under the Tesoro Corporation revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) and our term loan credit facility agreement (the “Term Loan Facility”), which were used to finance the Los Angeles Acquisition, in addition to TLLP debt totaling $800 million to fund their acquisitions of the Los Angeles Terminal Assets and Los Angeles Logistics Assets. Capitalized interest increased $3 million during 2013 to $19 million from $16 million during 2012, which is recorded as a reduction to net interest and financing costs.

 54
Net interest and financing costs decreased $12 million, or 7% to $167 million in 2012 from $179 million in 2011. We redeemed $328 million of our Junior Subordinated Notes and senior notes in 2011 and $299 million of our senior notes in 2012, resulting in a decrease in interest expense in 2012. The decrease in interest expense was partially offset by an increase of $6 million for charges associated with the early redemption of debt during 2012 as compared to 2011. Capitalized interest increased $2 million during 2012 to $16 million from $14 million during 2011, which is recorded as a reduction to net interest and financing costs.

Other Income (Expense), Net. We recorded other income, net, of $63 million in 2013 compared to other expense, net of $26 million in 2012. The increase was driven by a refund from the settlement of a rate proceeding from the California Public Utilities Commission of $54 million and the release of a $16 million legal reserve as a result of the favorable settlement of litigation during 2013. Other expense, net, of $26 million recorded in 2012, includes accruals related to certain legal matters partially offset by receipts associated with the settlement of a pipeline rate proceeding during the year. 

Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $246 million in 2013 compared to $527 million in 2012 and $359 million in 2011. The combined federal and state effective income tax rates were 36%, 37% and 38% in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The 2013 and 2012 rates benefited from an increased share of non-taxable minority interest income attributable to growth in TLLP income.

Earnings (loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Income Tax. Earnings from discontinued operations related to the Hawaii Business, net of tax, were $20 million in 2013, compared to losses of $133 million in 2012 and $30 million in 2011. We ceased refining operations at the Hawaii refinery in April 2013. However, we entered into an agreement to sell all of our Hawaii Business in June 2013, which required us to restart the refinery before closing the transaction. The Hawaii refinery was not operating for the majority of 2013, which resulted in a pre-tax net loss of $47 million during the year, prior to the sale on September 25, 2013. We recorded an $81 million gain on the sale of the Hawaii Business during 2013, which includes a $17 million curtailment gain related to the remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Earnings from discontinued operations in 2013 also include a benefit from a downward asset retirement obligations (“AROs”) adjustment of $14 million. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, existing AROs were assumed by the purchaser upon the close of the transaction.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Overview

We operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined products, availability of trade credit, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control. These factors include the level of consumer demand for transportation fuels, weather conditions, fluctuations in seasonal demand, governmental regulations, geo-political conditions and overall market and global economic conditions. See “Important Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” on page 36 for further information related to risks and other factors. Future capital expenditures, as well as borrowings under our credit agreements and other sources of capital, may be affected by these conditions.

Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit. We had additional cash flows related to TLLP’s acquisition of assets from us during 2013 and 2012. We ended 2013 with $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility or the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. We believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure, working capital and debt service requirements.

We closed the Los Angeles Acquisition on June 1, 2013 and funded the purchase with a combination of cash and debt, including $700 million of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and $500 million under the Term Loan Facility. We amended our Revolving Credit Facility to allow for an increase in the capacity to $3.0 billion in May 2013. The remaining $544 million of the purchase price was funded with cash received from TLLP for its acquisition of the Los Angeles Terminal Assets that occurred directly after the Los Angeles Acquisition. TLLP funded the acquisition with borrowings under its TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. We received an additional $585 million of cash in December 2013, when TLLP acquired the Los Angeles Logistics Assets from us. TLLP funded the acquisition with borrowings under its TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and the issuance of equity. We repaid all of the borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility and $102 million of the borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility during 2013.

 55
Capitalization

Our capital structure at December 31, 2013 was comprised of the following (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our debt to capitalization ratio at December 31, 2013, excluding capital leases associated with our discontinued operations, had increased to 34% as compared to 25% at December 31, 2012, primarily caused by the borrowings related to the Los Angeles Acquisition as discussed above.

Our debt to capitalization ratio, excluding TLLP and capital leases associated with discontinued operations, was 28% and 22%, at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, which excludes TLLP total debt, including capital leases, of $1.2 billion and $354 million. The ratio also excludes noncontrolling interest of $1.2 billion and $486 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. TLLP’s debt is non-recourse to Tesoro, except for Tesoro Logistics GP.

Credit Facilities Overview

We had available capacity under our credit agreements as follows at December 31, 2013 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(a)Borrowing base is the lesser of the amount of the periodically adjusted borrowing base or the agreement’s total capacity.

 56
As of December 31, 2013, our credit facilities were subject to the following expenses and fees:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(b)We can elect the interest rate to apply to the facility between a base rate plus the base rate margin, or a Eurodollar rate, for the applicable term, plus the Eurodollar margin at the time of the borrowing. The applicable margin on the Revolving Credit Facility varies primarily based upon its credit ratings. Letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility incur fees at the Eurodollar margin rate. 

(c)TLLP has the option to elect if the borrowings will bear interest at either, a base rate plus the base rate margin or a Eurodollar rate, for the applicable period, plus the Eurodollar margin at the time of the borrowing. The applicable margin varies based upon a certain leverage ratio, as defined by the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. TLLP incurs commitment fees for the unused portion of the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility. Letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility incur fees at the Eurodollar margin rate.

Tesoro Corporation Revolving Credit Facility 

We entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement effective January 4, 2013, which permitted us to increase the capacity of our Revolving Credit Facility to an aggregate of $3.0 billion on May 21, 2013. We borrowed $700 million on May 30, 2013 under the Revolving Credit Facility to fund a portion of the Los Angeles Acquisition. We repaid all of the borrowings outstanding under this facility during the fourth quarter of 2013.

At December 31, 2013, our Revolving Credit Facility provided for borrowings (including letters of credit) up to the lesser of the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base of approximately $3.3 billion, consisting of Tesoro’s eligible cash and cash equivalents, receivables and petroleum inventories, net of the standard reserve as defined, or the Revolving Credit Facility’s total capacity of $3.0 billion. The total available capacity can be increased up to an aggregate amount of $4.0 billion, subject to receiving increased commitments from the lenders; however, we must offer to reduce the commitments by at least $500 million on or prior to November 21, 2014 and by an additional $500 million on or prior to May 21, 2015. We had unused credit availability of approximately 74% of the eligible borrowing base at December 31, 2013. 

The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by substantially all of Tesoro’s active domestic subsidiaries excluding TLGP, TLLP and its subsidiaries, and certain foreign subsidiaries, and is secured by substantially all of Tesoro’s active domestic subsidiaries’ crude oil and refined product inventories, cash and receivables.

Our Revolving Credit Facility, senior notes and Term Loan Facility each limit our ability to make certain restricted payments (as defined in our debt agreements), which include dividends, purchases of our stock or voluntary prepayments of subordinate debt. The aggregate amount of restricted payments cannot exceed an amount defined in each of the debt agreements. The indentures for our senior notes also limit certain of our subsidiaries ability to make certain payments and distributions. We do not believe that the limitations will restrict our ability to pay dividends or buy back stock under our current programs. These existing covenants and restrictions may limit, among other things, our ability to:

•pay dividends and make other distributions with respect to our capital stock and purchase, redeem or retire our capital stock;

•incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock;

•make voluntary prepayments of subordinate debt;

•sell assets unless the proceeds from those sales are used to repay debt or are reinvested in our business;

•incur liens on assets to secure certain debt;

•engage in certain business activities;

•make certain payments and distributions from our subsidiaries;

•engage in certain mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets; and

•enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

 57
We have a default covenant that requires us to maintain specified levels of tangible net worth. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013.

TLLP Revolving Credit Facility

The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility provided for total loan availability of $575 million as of December 31, 2013, and TLLP may request that the loan availability be increased up to an aggregate of $650 million, subject to receiving increased commitments from the lenders. The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility is non-recourse to Tesoro, except for TLGP, and is guaranteed by all of TLLP’s subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of TLLP’s assets. Borrowings are available under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility up to the total loan availability of the facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2013. The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on December 31, 2017. 

The TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and our TLLP Senior Notes contain certain covenants that may, among other things, limit or restrict TLLP’s ability (as well as those of TLLP’s subsidiaries) to:

•incur additional indebtedness and incur liens on assets to secure certain debt;

•pay and make certain restricted payments; 

•make distributions from its subsidiaries;

•dispose of assets in excess of an annual threshold amount;

•in the case of the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility, make certain amendments, modifications or supplements to organization documents and material contracts;

•in the case of the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility, engage in certain business activities;

•engage in certain mergers or consolidations and transfers of assets; and

•enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

We do not believe that the limitations imposed by the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility will restrict TLLP’s ability to pay distributions. Additionally, the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants that require TLLP to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. TLLP was in compliance with all TLLP Revolving Credit Facility covenants and conditions as of and for the year ended December 31, 2013. 

Term Loan Facility

We entered into a term loan facility in January 2013, which allowed us to borrow up to an aggregate of $500 million. We borrowed $500 million to fund a portion of the Los Angeles Acquisition on May 30, 2013. The obligations under the Term Loan Facility are secured by all equity interests of Tesoro Refining & Marketing Company LLC and Tesoro Alaska Company, the Tesoro and USA Gasoline trademarks and those trademarks containing the name “ARCO” acquired in the Los Angeles Acquisition, and junior liens on certain assets. We repaid $102 million of the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility during the year ended December 31, 2013. The Term Loan Facility may be repaid at any time but amounts may not be re-borrowed. The borrowings under our Term Loan Facility incurred interest at a rate of 2.42% as of December 31, 2013. The Term Loan Facility matures three years from the initial borrowing on May 30, 2016.

The Term Loan Facility contains affirmative covenants, representations and warranties and events of default substantially similar to those set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility and contains negative covenants substantially similar to those set forth in the indentures for the 4.250% Senior Notes due 2017 (“2017 Notes”) and 5.375% Senior Notes due 2022 (“2022 Notes”).

Letter of Credit Agreements

The Revolving Credit Facility allows us to obtain letters of credit under separate letter of credit agreements for foreign crude oil purchases. Our uncommitted letter of credit agreements had $635 million outstanding as of December 31, 2013. Letters of credit outstanding under these agreements incur fees and are secured by the crude oil inventories for which they are issued. Capacity under these letter of credit agreements is available on an uncommitted basis and can be terminated by either party at any time.

 58
5.875% TLLP Senior Notes due 2020 

Effective December 17, 2013, TLLP completed a private offering of $250 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “December 2013 TLLP Debt Offering”) pursuant to a private placement transaction conducted under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The December 2013 TLLP Debt Offering was issued under the Indenture governing the $350 million of TLLP’s 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020 issued on September 14, 2012 (the “September 2012 TLLP Debt Offering”) and has the same terms as the September 2012 TLLP Debt Offering (together with the December 2013 TLLP Debt Offering, the “TLLP 2020 Notes”). The December 2013 TLLP Debt Offering was issued at 102.25% of face value for an effective rate of 5.334%. The proceeds of the December 2013 TLLP Debt Offering were used (i) to repay the amounts outstanding under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility, which were used to fund a portion of its acquisition of the Los Angeles Logistics Assets, (ii) to pay for the fees and expenses related to the December 2013 TLLP Debt Offering and (iii) for general partnership purposes. 

The TLLP 2020 Notes have no sinking fund requirements. TLLP may redeem some or all of the TLLP 2020 Notes, prior to October 1, 2016, at a make-whole price plus accrued and unpaid interest. On or after October 1, 2016, the TLLP 2020 Notes may be redeemed at premiums equal to 2.938% through October 1, 2017; 1.469% from October 1, 2017 through October 1, 2018; and at par thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest in all circumstances. TLLP will have the right to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount at 105.875% of face value with proceeds from certain equity issuances through October 1, 2015. The TLLP 2020 Notes are unsecured and guaranteed by all of TLLP’s domestic subsidiaries, except Tesoro Logistics Finance Corp., the co-issuer, and are non-recourse to Tesoro, except for TLGP. The TLLP 2020 Notes also contain customary terms, events of default and covenants for an issuance of non-investment grade securities. 

6.125% TLLP Senior Notes due 2021

TLLP completed a private offering of $550 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “TLLP 2021 Notes”) effective August 1, 2013. The proceeds of this offering were used to repay the amounts outstanding under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility, which were used to fund a significant portion of TLLP’s acquisition of the Los Angeles Terminal Assets, and to pay a portion of the fees and expenses related to the offering of the TLLP 2021 Notes. 

The TLLP 2021 Notes have no sinking fund requirements. TLLP may redeem some or all of the TLLP 2021 Notes, prior to October 15, 2016, at a make-whole price plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. On or after October 15, 2016, the TLLP 2021 Notes may be redeemed at premiums equal to 4.594% through October 15, 2017; 3.063% from October 15, 2017 through October 15, 2018; 1.531% from October 15, 2018 through October 15, 2019; and at par thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest in all circumstances. TLLP will have the right to redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount at 106.125% of face value with proceeds from certain equity issuances through October 15, 2016. The TLLP 2021 Notes are unsecured and guaranteed by all of TLLP’s domestic subsidiaries, except Tesoro Logistics Finance Corp., the co-issuer, and are non-recourse to Tesoro, except for TLGP. The TLLP 2021 Notes also contain customary terms, events of default and covenants for an issuance of non-investment grade securities.

Registration Rights Agreement and Exchange Offer

TLLP completed an offer on September 12, 2013 to exchange $350 million of the TLLP 2020 Notes from the September 2012 TLLP Debt Offering and the TLLP 2021 Notes (the “Unregistered Notes”) for an equal principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020 and 6.125% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “Exchange Notes”), respectively, that were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The terms of the Exchange Notes are identical in all material respects (including principal amount, interest rate, maturity and redemption rights) to the Unregistered Notes for which they were exchanged, except that the Exchange Notes generally are not subject to transfer restrictions. The exchange offer fulfills all of the requirements of the registration rights agreements for such Unregistered notes. 

The $250 million aggregate principal amount of the TLLP 2020 Notes that were issued in the December 2013 TLLP Debt Offering are subject to registration rights agreements whereby TLLP has agreed to exchange the notes for registered publicly-traded notes having substantially identical terms as the unregistered notes.

Share Repurchase Programs

Management is permitted to purchase Tesoro common stock at its discretion in the open market under a share repurchase program. The program was originally authorized by our Board in 2012 in the amount of $500 million, and increased to $1.0 billion by our Board on November 6, 2013. The shares will continue to be purchased at management’s discretion in the open market. The authorization has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. We purchased approximately 7.8 million shares and 2.5 million shares of our common stock under this program, for $400 million and $100 million during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. 

Our Board approved a program designed to offset the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation awards during 2011. We used this program to purchase approximately 0.6 million shares of our common stock for approximately $36 million during 2013, and 1.0 million shares of our common stock for approximately $26 million during 2012.

Cash Dividends

We paid cash dividends on common stock totaling $121 million and $38 million during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We did not pay any cash dividends during 2011. Our Board declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of $0.25 per share on February 5, 2014. The dividend is payable on March 14, 2014 to holders of record at the close of business on February 28, 2014. 

Cash Flow Summary

Components of our cash flows are set forth below (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2013 Compared to 2012

Net cash from operating activities decreased $726 million, or 46%, to $859 million in 2013, as compared to $1.6 billion in 2012. The decrease in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to lower earnings in 2013, which includes an $81 million gain related to the sale of the Hawaii Business, as compared to 2012. There was also a $174 million increase in deferred charges primarily as a result of increased turnaround spending of $105 million and the purchase of $63 million of emissions credits during 2013.

Net cash used in investing activities increased $1.9 billion, or 270% to $2.6 billion in 2013, as compared to $696 million in 2012. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the Los Angeles Acquisition, TLLP’s acquisition of the Northwest Products System and increased cash capital expenditures of $41 million. Partially offsetting these uses of cash during 2013 was the receipt of gross proceeds of $539 million from the sale of the Hawaii Business and advance payments made for acquisitions during 2012 of $130 million. 

Net cash from financing activities during 2013 totaled $1.3 billion as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $150 million in 2012. Proceeds from financing activities during 2013 include $700 million and $544 million in proceeds from borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and TLLP’s Revolving Credit Facility, respectively, and $500 million of proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, all of which were used to fund the Los Angeles Acquisition during 2013. TLLP completed two private offerings of debt during August and December 2013, and used the net proceeds of $806 million primarily to repay borrowings outstanding under the TLLP Revolving Credit Facility and to partially fund the Los Angeles Logistics Assets acquisition. Additional net proceeds of approximately $702 million from the issuance of TLLP common units were subsequently used by TLLP to fund the acquisition of the Northwest Products System and the remainder of TLLP’s Los Angeles Logistics Assets acquisition. We used cash on hand to repay all of the borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and $102 million of the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility in 2013. Additionally, purchases of common stock under our share repurchase programs increased $315 million during 2013 as compared to 2012.

 60
Working capital (excluding cash) increased $564 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily related to the acquisition of $1.1 billion of inventories and other working capital in conjunction with the Los Angeles Acquisition. These amounts were offset by an increase in accounts payable as a result of increased purchases of feedstocks associated with the higher throughput in 2013, and a decrease in working capital of $277 million, related to the sale of the Hawaii Business.

2012 Compared to 2011

Net cash from operating activities increased $896 million, or 130%, to $1.6 billion in 2012 as compared to $689 million in 2011. The increase in net cash from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in inventories of approximately 1.5 million barrels during 2012 compared to a significant increase in inventories of approximately 4.1 million barrels during 2011, as well as higher net earnings of $207 million in 2012, which includes a non-cash impairment charge of $228 million related to the Hawaii refinery. 

Net cash used in investing activities increased $405 million, or 139% to $696 million in 2012 as compared to $291 million in 2011 primarily due to increased cash capital expenditures of $231 million as a result of our 2012 capital programs. We also made advance payments to secure the Los Angeles Acquisition and TLLP’s acquisition of the Northwest Products System of $90 million and $40 million, respectively, and paid $37 million to acquire 49 retail stations from SUPERVALU, Inc. during 2012.

Net cash used in financing activities increased $4 million from $146 million in 2011 to $150 million in 2012. The primary uses of cash during 2012 were the redemption of the remaining 6.250% Senior Notes outstanding for $299 million, the purchase of common stock for approximately $131 million, total net repayments on the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility and TLLP Revolving Credit Facility of $167 million, and dividend payments of $38 million. Sources of cash during 2012 include proceeds from TLLP’s issuance of $350 million aggregate principal amount 5.875% Senior Notes and proceeds from TLLP’s issuance of its common units of $171 million. In addition, we issued $925 million aggregate principal amount senior notes, to refinance the remaining outstanding 6.625% Senior Notes and 6.500% Senior Notes. Net cash used in financing activities during 2011 is comprised of $178 million for the redemption of a portion of the 6.250% Senior Notes and 6.500% Senior Notes, $150 million for the redemption of the Junior Subordinated Notes, the purchase of common stock for $101 million, and a reduction in borrowings under the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility of $33 million, offset by proceeds from TLLP’s Initial Offering of $288 million. 

Working capital (excluding cash) increased $114 million in 2012, primarily as a result of a decrease in current maturities of debt during 2012, including the redemption of the $299 million remaining 6.250% Senior Notes due 2012 and net repayments of $117 million of short-term borrowings on the TPSA Revolving Credit Facility. The increase was partially offset by a reduction in inventories of approximately 1.5 million barrels during 2012, and increases in accrued liabilities as a result of higher accrued employee costs and tax liabilities.

 61
Capital Expenditures

Our capital expenditures, excluding discontinued operations of the Hawaii Business, during 2013 were $558 million, including $79 million of TLLP capital spending. Our capital spending budget for 2014 of $670 million reflects the Company’s emphasis on long term strategic priorities including continued focus on safety and reliability and greater focus on value-driven growth. The 2014 capital budget excludes TLLP expected capital spending of $160 million, which is primarily financed by TLLP. Our 2014 budgeted and 2013 actual capital expenditure amounts, excluding TLLP capital spending, are comprised of the following project categories at December 31, 2013:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The cost estimates for capital expenditures, described below are subject to further review and analysis and permitting requirements. Our capital spending plans include the following major projects (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(a)The cost estimates for capital expenditures exclude estimates for capitalized interest and labor costs. 

(b)2013 actual capital expenditure disclosures include capitalized interest and labor costs associated with the project.

(c)The expansion project at the Utah refinery is designed to improve yields of gasoline and diesel, improve the flexibility of processing crude feedstocks and increase throughput capacity by 4 Mbpd. The first phase of this project was completed in the second quarter of 2013 and the second phase is expected to be completed in 2015. 

(d)The integration project at the Los Angeles refinery is designed to improve the flexibility of gasoline and diesel yields and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.

(e)The expansion of the diesel desulfurization unit increased the capacity of the unit from 17 Mbpd to 22 Mbpd and improved diesel fuel yield at the North Dakota refinery.

Turnarounds and Other Expenditures

Our 2014 budget for refinery turnarounds is $205 million. The turnaround spending is expected to be primarily at our California refineries. Refining throughput and yields in 2014 will be affected by these turnarounds. Our budget for 2014 also includes $65 million for other expenditures. We spent $360 million for refinery turnarounds during 2013, primarily at our Washington, California and Utah refineries, and approximately $21 million for other expenditures, primarily for branding related to our California retail network.

Investment in Joint Ventures

We entered into a joint venture with Savage Companies to construct, own and operate a unit train unloading and marine loading terminal at the Port of Vancouver, Washington with an initial capacity of 120 Mbpd. The project will allow for the delivery of cost-advantaged North American crude oil to the U.S. West Coast. Our contribution to the investment is expected to be between $50 million and $75 million. These contributions are considered investments in joint ventures and are presented in net cash used in investing activities in our statements of consolidated cash flows. We contributed $5 million during 2013. The construction is expected to be completed in late 2014 or early 2015.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements, other than our leasing arrangements described in Note S to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.

 62
Environmental and Tax Matters

We are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations, including environmental and income tax matters, arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters with certainty, we have accrued for the estimated liabilities when appropriate. We believe that the outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position, although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations. Additionally, if applicable, we accrue receivables for probable third-party recoveries.

We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws, which change frequently, regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites, install additional controls or make other modifications to certain emission sources, equipment or facilities.

Future expenditures may be required to comply with the Clean Air Act and other federal, state and local requirements for our various sites, including our refineries, tank farms, pipelines and currently and previously owned or operated terminal and retail station properties. The impact of these legislative and regulatory developments, including any greenhouse gas cap-and-trade program or low carbon fuel standards, could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions on our business and an increase in the cost of the products we manufacture, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) proposed regulating greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions under the Clean Air Act. The first of these regulations, finalized on April 1, 2010, set standards for the control of GHG emissions from light trucks and cars, which could reduce the demand for our manufactured transportation fuels. In addition, the EPA has also finalized regulations to establish permitting requirements for stationary sources that emit GHG above a certain threshold. While these regulations were challenged and upheld by the courts, on October 15, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear challenges to the EPA’s GHG regulations but limited the argument to whether the EPA’s GHG regulations for vehicles necessarily trigger Clean Air Act permitting requirements for stationary sources. If the U.S. Supreme Court upholds the EPA’s stationary source GHG regulations, the stationary source permitting requirements could impose emission controls that increase required capital expenditures at our refineries. We cannot currently predict the impact of these regulations on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

In December 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act was enacted into federal law, which created a second Renewable Fuels Standard (“RFS2”). This standard, based on current legislation, requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels (including ethanol and advanced biofuels) sold or introduced in the U.S. to reach 18.2 billion gallons in 2014 and to increase to 36 billion gallons by 2022. However, the EPA has proposed to reduce the total renewable fuel and advanced biofuel requirement to 15.2 billion for 2014. The requirements could reduce future demand growth for petroleum products that we manufacture. In the near term, the RFS2 presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for the ethanol, alternative fuel and refining and marketing industries. We are currently meeting the RFS2 requirements through a combination of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) that were carried over from prior periods, blending renewable fuels obtained from third parties and purchases of RINs in the open market. The spending related to the purchases of RINs for 2014 is not expected to be material based on our operations and the current regulatory environment. Actual cost related to RINs may differ due to changes in the market price of RINs and the ultimate destinations of our products. Additional expenditures could be required to logistically accommodate the increased use of renewable transportation fuels. While we cannot currently estimate the ultimate impact of this statute, and currently believe that the outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position or liquidity, the ultimate outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations. 

In California, Assembly Bill 32 (“AB 32”) created a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions and requires that the state return to 1990 emission levels by 2020. AB 32 focuses on using market mechanisms, such as a cap-and-trade program and a low carbon fuel standard (“LCFS”), to achieve emissions reduction targets. The LCFS became effective in January 2010 and requires a 10% reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel fuel by 2020. The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) approved cap-and-trade requirements in 2011, and all of AB 32 related regulations are to be fully implemented by 2020. In December 2011, a U.S. District Court ruled that the LCFS violate the U.S. Constitution. CARB appealed the decision and on September 18, 2013, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court’s decision and remanded the case to the lower court to rule on whether the ethanol provisions of the LCFS are unconstitutional. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the lower court’s ruling on the LCFS, and the implementation and implications of AB 32 will take many years to realize. Consequently, we cannot currently predict the impact of the LCFS on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

 63
We are subject to extensive federal, state and foreign tax laws and regulations. Newly enacted tax laws and regulations, and changes in existing tax laws and regulations, could result in increased expenditures in the future. We are also subject to audits by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities in the normal course of business. It is possible that tax audits could result in claims against us in excess of recorded liabilities. We believe that resolution of any such claim(s) would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

Environmental Liabilities

We are incurring and expect to continue to incur expenses for environmental liabilities at a number of currently and previously owned or operated refining, pipeline, terminal and retail station properties. We have accrued liabilities for these expenses and believe these accruals are adequate based on current information and projections that can be reasonably estimated. Our environmental accruals are based on estimates including engineering assessments, and it is possible that our projections will change and that additional costs will be recorded as more information becomes available. Changes in our environmental liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, were as follows (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The environmental remediation liabilities assumed in the Los Angeles Acquisition include amounts estimated for site cleanup activities and monitoring activities arising from operations at the Carson refinery, certain terminals and pipelines, and retail stations prior to our acquisition on June 1, 2013. These estimates for environmental liabilities are based on third-party assessments and available information. It is possible these estimates will change as additional information becomes available.

Our environmental liabilities also include $56 million and $54 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, related to amounts estimated for site cleanup activities assumed from a prior owner, arising from operations at our Martinez refinery prior to August 2000. Of the $56 million accrued at December 31, 2013, approximately $47 million is subject to a cost-share agreement where we are responsible for 75% of the expenditures. We cannot reasonably determine the full extent of remedial activities that may be required at the Martinez refinery. Therefore, it is possible that we will identify additional investigation and material remediation costs as more information becomes available and those remediation costs could have a material impact on our future interim or annual results of operations. However, we do not believe that the costs will have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position. We have filed insurance claims under environmental insurance policies for some of these remediation costs. These policies provide coverage up to $190 million for expenditures in excess of $50 million in self-insurance, but the insurer has challenged coverage and filed a declaratory relief action in federal court. We have not recognized possible insurance recoveries related to this matter. 

We have investigated conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our Martinez refinery. The investigation was driven by an order received in 2004 from the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board. The order named us as well as two previous owners of the Martinez refinery. We cannot currently estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of the order, but we believe it will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

 64
Washington Refinery Fire

The naphtha hydrotreater unit at our Washington refinery was involved in a fire in April 2010, which fatally injured seven employees and rendered the unit inoperable. The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries (“L&I”), the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (“CSB”) and the EPA initiated separate investigations of the incident. L&I completed its investigation in October 2010, issued citations and assessed a $2.4 million fine, which we appealed. L&I reassumed jurisdiction of the citation and affirmed the allegations in December 2010. We disagree with L&I’s characterizations of operations at our Washington refinery and believe, based on available evidence and scientific reviews, that many of the agency’s conclusions are mistaken. We filed an appeal of the citation in January 2011. In separate September 2013 and November 2013 orders, the Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals granted partial summary judgment in our favor and dismissed most of the citations. We have established an accrual for this matter although we cannot currently estimate the final amount or timing of its resolution. The outcome of this matter will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The CSB issued a draft report on January 30, 2014, regarding its investigation of the April 2010 Washington refinery naphtha hydrotreater fire. The draft report is available at www.csb.gov. While we cannot currently predict the timing of the finalization of the report, this matter will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

The EPA, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), is continuing its criminal investigation of the Washington naphtha hydrotreater fire, but we cannot predict what action, if any, the EPA and DOJ will take. As a result, we cannot currently estimate the amount or timing of the resolution of any action that may result from this investigation.

Other Matters

In the ordinary course of business, we become party to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and governmental investigations, including environmental, regulatory and other matters. Large, and sometimes unspecified, damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters. We have not established accruals for these matters unless a loss is probable, and the amount of loss is currently estimable. On the basis of existing information, we believe that the resolution of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our liquidity or financial position, although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material impact on our interim or annual results of operations.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as the Financial Reform Act of 2010, was enacted into federal law in July 2010. Key provisions of the act require that certain standardized swaps be cleared through a registered clearinghouse and executed on a registered trading platform with specific margin requirements. These requirements could make these products more complicated or costly by creating new regulatory risks and increasing reporting, capital, and administrative requirements for companies that use derivatives for hedging and trading activities. With the implementation of several final rules currently underway, we believe they will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

Legal

In 2007, we obtained a ruling from the CPUC that an intrastate crude oil pipeline, which transports heated crude oil to our Martinez Refinery from the area around Bakersfield, California, was a common carrier subject to the jurisdiction of the CPUC. After that time, we participated in rate proceedings to determine an appropriate rate structure for this pipeline. In May 2013, the CPUC issued final orders establishing just and reasonable rates for the pipeline for the period between April 1, 2005 and June 30, 2011, and held that we were entitled to receive refunds, including interest. In accordance with this ruling, we received a refund of $54 million in June 2013, which is included in other income (expense), net in our statements of consolidated operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. 

We are a defendant, along with other manufacturing, supply and marketing defendants, in one remaining lawsuit brought by the Orange County Water District, alleging methyl tertiary butyl ether (“MTBE”) contamination in groundwater. The Court granted our motion for summary judgment in the lawsuit brought by the City of Fresno, California, in September 2013. The defendants in the remaining lawsuit, which is proceeding in the United States District Court of the Southern District of New York, are being sued for having manufactured MTBE and having manufactured, supplied and distributed gasoline containing MTBE. The plaintiff alleges, in part, that the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product. The suit generally seeks individual, unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorney’s fees. We intend to vigorously assert our defenses against this claim. While we cannot currently estimate the final amount or timing of the resolution of this matter, we have established an accrual and believe that the outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

 65
During 2009, Chevron filed a lawsuit against us claiming they are entitled to a share of the refunds we received in 2008 from the owners of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (“TAPS”). We received $50 million in 2008, net of contingent legal fees, for excessive intrastate rates charged by TAPS during 1997 through 2000 and the period of 2001 through June 2003. Chevron asserted that it was entitled to a share of its portion of the refunds for retroactive price adjustments under our previous crude oil contracts with them. The trial court judge granted Chevron’s motion for summary judgment and awarded them $16 million, including interest, in September 2010. We disagreed with the trial court and appealed the decision to the Alaska Supreme Court. The Alaska Supreme Court issued an order requiring the Superior Court to enter summary judgment in our favor in July 2013. We had previously established an accrual of $16 million for this matter, which was released in the third quarter of 2013. The benefit was recorded in other income (expense), net, in our statement of consolidated operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Environmental 

Certain non-governmental organizations filed a Request for Agency Action (the “Request”) in October 2012 with the Utah Department of Environmental Quality (“UDEQ”) concerning our Utah refinery. The Request challenges the UDEQ’s permitting of our refinery conversion project alleging that the permits do not conform to the requirements of the Clean Air Act. As the permittee, we are the real party in interest and will be defending the permits with UDEQ. While we are still evaluating the Request and cannot estimate the timing or estimated amount, if any, associated with the outcome, we do not believe it will have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.

The EPA has alleged that we have violated certain Clean Air Act regulations at our Alaska, Washington, Martinez, North Dakota and Utah refineries. We also retained the responsibility for resolving similar allegations relating to our former Hawaii refinery, which we sold in September 2013. We previously received a notice of violation (“NOV”) in March 2011 from the EPA alleging violations of Title V of the Clean Air Act at our Alaska refinery, which arose from a 2007 state of Alaska inspection and inspections by the EPA in 2008 and 2010. We also previously received NOVs in 2005 and 2008 alleging violations of the Clean Air Act at our Washington refinery. We are continuing discussions of all EPA claims with the EPA and the DOJ. The ultimate resolution of these matters could have a material impact on our future interim or annual results of operations, as we may be required to incur material capital expenditures and/or civil penalties. However, we do not believe that the outcome will have a material impact on our liquidity or financial position.

 66
Long-Term Commitments

Contractual Commitments

We have numerous contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our refineries, debt service and leases (see Notes O and S to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8). We also have minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects. The contractual commitments detailed below do not include our contractual obligations to TLLP under our various fee-based commercial agreements as these related-party transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The following table summarizes our annual contractual commitments as of December 31, 2013 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

________________

(a)Includes maturities of principal and interest payments, excluding capital lease obligations. Amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings.

(b)Capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest. Operating lease obligations primarily represent our future minimum noncancellable lease commitments. Operating lease obligations primarily include lease arrangements with initial or remaining noncancellable terms in excess of one year and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d)Represents long-term commitments primarily for the transportation of crude oil and refined products as well as to purchase industrial gases, chemical processing services and utilities at our refineries. These purchase obligations are based on the contract’s minimum volume requirements.

(e)Minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects.

We also have other noncurrent liabilities pertaining to our defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations. With the exception of amounts classified as current there is uncertainty as to the timing of future cash flows related to these obligations. As such, we have excluded the future cash flows from the contractual commitments table above. See additional information on pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental liabilities and asset retirement obligations in Note R, Note S and Note P, respectively, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.

In addition, due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows with our unrecognized tax benefits, with the exception of amounts classified as current, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement. Accordingly, we have excluded from the table $4 million of unrecognized tax benefits recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Related to these unrecognized tax benefits, and also excluded from the table, is a liability for potential interest and penalties of $1 million at December 31, 2013. See Note Q to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

 67
Pension Funding

We provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan for all eligible employees, with benefits based on years of service and compensation. Our long-term expected return on plan assets is 6.50% as of December 31, 2013, and the return on our funded employee pension plan assets was $15 million, or 4.0%, in 2013 and $34 million, or 9.8%, in 2012. Based on a 4.96% discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of December 31, 2013, the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately 70% of the projected benefit obligation. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (“MAP-21”) was signed into law in July 2012, which includes provisions for pension funding relief for plan sponsors by stabilizing the interest rates used to determine their pension funding requirements. Previous funding rules required using a discount rate based on a two-year average of high quality corporate bond rates to determine pension liabilities and minimum contributions. The new legislation stipulates that the discount rate must remain within a specified corridor of a 25-year average corporate bond rate, with such corridor widening from 10% to 30% between 2012 and 2016. The provisions of MAP-21 were effective for plan years beginning on or after January 2012. On this new MAP-21 basis, at January 1, 2013 the adjusted funding target attainment percentage (a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations) was 110%. Tesoro contributed $48 million during 2013, a portion of which was in excess of the minimum required.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Critical Accounting Policies

Our accounting policies are described in Note A to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Property, Plant and Equipment and Acquired Intangibles — We calculate depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives and salvage values of our assets. When assets are placed into service, we make estimates with respect to their useful lives that we believe are reasonable. However, factors such as maintenance levels, economic conditions impacting the demand for these assets, and regulatory or environmental requirements could cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization. 

We evaluate these assets for potential impairment when an asset disposition is probable or when there are indicators of impairment (for example, current period operating losses combined with a history of operating losses or a temporary shutdown of a refinery) and, if so, assessing whether the asset net book values are recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The actual amount of an impairment loss to be recorded, if any, is equal to the amount by which the asset’s net book value exceeds its fair market value. Fair market value is based on the present values of estimated future cash flows in the absence of quoted market prices. Estimates of future cash flows and fair market values of assets require subjective assumptions with regard to several factors, including an assessment of global market conditions, future operating results and forecasts of the remaining useful lives of the assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Providing sensitivity analysis if other assumptions were used in performing the impairment evaluations is not practicable due to the significant number of assumptions involved in the estimates. At December 31, 2012, we evaluated certain of our refineries for potential impairment. See Notes D and K to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion of the impairment analysis and certain losses resulting from the analysis.

Income Taxes — As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. We must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely. Significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $8 million on certain state tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2013, based on our estimates of taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred income tax assets will be recoverable. We may need to establish an additional valuation allowance if actual results differ from these estimates or we make adjustments to these estimates in future periods. 

We also recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. Tax positions that are not recognized that we have taken or expect to take are generally recorded as liabilities. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties totaled $5 million and $17 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits — Accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves several assumptions and estimates including discount rates, expected rate of return on plan assets, rates of compensation, health care cost trends, inflation, retirement rates and mortality rates. We must assume a rate of return on funded pension plan assets in order to estimate our obligations under our defined benefit plans. Due to the nature of these calculations, we engage an actuarial firm to assist with these estimates and the calculation of certain employee benefit expenses. We record an asset for our plans overfunded status or a liability if the plans are underfunded. The funded status represents the difference between the fair value of our plans’ assets and the projected benefit obligations. While we believe the assumptions we used are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations. We determine the discount rate primarily by reference to the effective yields on high quality corporate bonds that have a comparable cash flow pattern to the expected payments to be made under our plans. The expected return on plan assets is based upon the weighted averages of the expected long-term rates of return for the broad categories of investments held in our plans and also uses a three-year average of the market value of plan assets. These assumptions can have a significant effect on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements.

A one-percentage-point change in the expected return on plan assets and discount rate for the funded qualified employee retirement plan would have had the following effects in 2013 (in millions):

See Note R to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information regarding costs and assumptions.

Environmental Liabilities — At December 31, 2013 and 2012, our total environmental liabilities included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities were $262 million and $85 million, respectively. We record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or proposed environmental remedies are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Usually, the timing of our accruals coincides with assessing the liability and then completing a feasibility study or committing to a formal plan of action. When we complete our analysis or when we commit to a plan of action, we accrue a liability based on the minimum range of the expected costs, unless we consider another amount more likely. We base our cost estimates on the extent of remedial actions required by applicable governing agencies, experience gained from similar environmental projects and the amounts to be paid by other responsible parties. 

Accruals for our environmental liabilities require judgment due to the uncertainties related to the magnitude of the liability and timing of the remediation effort. Our environmental liability estimates are subject to change due to potential changes in environmental laws, regulations or interpretations, additional information related to the extent and nature of the liability, and potential improvements in remediation technologies. We do not discount our estimated liabilities to present value.

Acquisitions — We use the acquisition method of accounting for the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed with acquisitions at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition. Any excess consideration transferred over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired. As a result, in the case of significant acquisitions, we obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.

Stock-Based Compensation — We follow the fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation. We estimate the fair value of options and certain other stock-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or a Monte Carlo simulation with assumptions based primarily on historical data. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires assumptions including the expected term the stock-based awards are held until exercised, the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term, and the number of awards that will be forfeited prior to vesting. The Monte Carlo simulation takes into account the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as outlined above; however, it also incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied and impact of the possible differing stock price paths. Changes in our assumptions, including forfeiture and volatility estimates, may impact the expenses related to our stock-based awards. The fair values of our stock appreciation rights, phantom stock options, and performance share awards based on market conditions are remeasured at the end of each reporting period and are recorded as other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 

New Accounting Standards and Disclosures

Presentation of Comprehensive Income

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) in June 2011, regarding the presentation of comprehensive income. This ASU eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) as part of the statement of shareholders’ equity. Instead, the company must report comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income, which contains two sections, net income and OCI, or in two separate but consecutive statements. We adopted these presentation requirements and are presenting components of OCI in two consecutive statements. 

 70
Additionally, the FASB issued an ASU in February 2013 that provides entities the option of presenting information related to reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements or in the notes to the financial statements for items that are reclassified from OCI to net income in the statement where those components are presented. The requirements from the new ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of these requirements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

The FASB issued an ASU in December 2011, which requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of these arrangements on its financial position. The guidance requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the balance sheet and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. In January 2013, the FASB amended and clarified the scope of the disclosures to include only derivative instruments, repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions. The provisions for this ASU are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2013. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
