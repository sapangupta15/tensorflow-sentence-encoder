RISK FACTORS

For an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could affect our business and financial results. The factors described below are considered to be the most significant. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on the Company’s future results. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The following discussion of risk factors should be read in conjunction with “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.

A Decline in Advertising Expenditures Could Cause the Company’s Revenues and Operating Results to Decline Significantly in Any Given Period or in Specific Markets

The Company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on its broadcast and basic cable networks, television stations, radio stations, syndicated programming, and online properties. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers, the economy in general or the economy of any individual geographic market, particularly a major market such as Los Angeles, New York or Chicago, in which the Company owns and operates sizeable businesses, could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities. Natural and other disasters, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of disrupted programming and services, uninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty. Advertising expenditures may also be affected by increasing competition for the leisure time of audiences. In addition, advertising expenditures by companies in 

I-18

certain sectors of the economy, including the automotive, financial and pharmaceutical segments, represent a significant portion of the Company’s advertising revenues. Any political, economic, social or technological change resulting in a reduction in these sectors’ advertising expenditures may adversely affect the Company’s revenue. Advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from the Company may also be affected by a decline in audience ratings for the Company’s programming, the inability of the Company to retain the rights to popular programming, increasing audience fragmentation caused by new program channels and the proliferation of new media formats, including the Internet and video‑on‑demand and the deployment of portable digital devices and new technologies, which allow consumers to live stream and time shift programming, make and store digital copies and skip or fast‑forward through advertisements. Any reduction in advertising expenditures could have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues and results of operations.

The Company’s Success and Profitability Are Dependent Upon Audience Acceptance of Its Content, Including Its Television and Radio Programs and Motion Pictures, Which Is Difficult to Predict

Television, radio and motion picture content production and distribution are inherently risky businesses because the revenues derived from the production and distribution of a television or radio program or motion picture, and the licensing of rights to the associated intellectual property, depend primarily upon their acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of a television or radio program or motion picture also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs and motion pictures released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict. Rating points are also factors that are weighed when determining the advertising rates that the Company receives. The use of new ratings technologies and measurements, and viewership on new platforms or devices that is not being measured, could have an impact on the Company’s program ratings. For example, while C-3, a current television industry ratings system, measures live commercial viewing plus three days of DVR and video-on-demand playback, the growing viewership occurring on subsequent days of DVR and video‑on‑demand playback is excluded from C-3 ratings. Poor ratings can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending. For example, there can be no assurance that any replacement programming on the Company’s radio or television stations will generate the same level of revenues or profitability of previous programming. In addition, the success of the Company’s cable networks and Simon & Schuster is similarly dependent on audience acceptance of its programming and publications, respectively. The theatrical success of a motion picture, based in large part upon audience acceptance, is a significant factor in determining the revenues it is likely to generate in home entertainment sales, licensing fees and other exploitation during the various other distribution windows. Consequently, low public acceptance of the Company’s content, including its television and radio programs, motion pictures and publications, will have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. In addition, any decreased popularity of programming for which the Company has incurred significant commitments could have an adverse effect on its profitability. Programming and talent commitments of the Company, estimated to aggregate approximately $13.72 billion as of December 31, 2014, primarily included $10.23 billion for sports programming rights, $2.70 billion relating to the production and licensing of television, radio, and film programming, and $797 million for talent contracts with $4.32 billion of these amounts payable in and after 2020. A shortfall, now or in the future, in the expected popularity of the sports events for which the Company has acquired rights, or in the television and radio programming the Company expects to distribute, could lead to decreased profitability or losses for a significant period of time.

Failure by the Company to Obtain, Create and Retain the Rights Related to Popular Programming Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Revenues

The Company’s revenue from its television, radio, cable networks and motion picture business is partially dependent on the Company’s continued ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behavior on a timely basis. Moreover, the Company derives a portion of its revenues from the exploitation of its extensive library of television programming. Generally, a television series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic syndication. If the content of its television programming library ceases to be widely accepted by audiences or is not continuously replenished with popular content, the Company’s revenues could be adversely affected. The Company obtains a significant portion of its popular programming from third parties. For example, some of CBS Television Network’s most widely viewed broadcasts, including golf’s Masters Tournament, 

I-19

the PGA Championship, NFL games, NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament games, and series such as The Big Bang Theory, are made available based upon programming rights of varying duration that the Company has negotiated with third parties. In addition, Showtime Networks enters into commitments to acquire rights to certain programming for Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix from motion picture producers and other suppliers for varying durations, and CBS Radio acquires the broadcast rights to syndicated shows and to various programs, such as sports events from third parties. CBS Films competes for compelling source material for and the talent necessary to produce motion pictures, as well as with other buyers for the acquisition of third‑party produced motion pictures. Competition for popular programming that is licensed from third parties is intense, and the Company may be outbid by its competitors for the rights to new, popular programming or in connection with the renewal of popular programming currently licensed by the Company. The Company’s failure to obtain or retain rights to popular content could adversely affect the Company’s revenues.

The Company Must Respond to Rapid Changes in Technology, Content Creation, Services and Standards in Order to Remain Competitive

Video, telecommunications, radio and data services technologies used in the entertainment industry are changing rapidly as are the digital distribution models for books. Advances in technologies or alternative methods of product delivery or storage, or certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these or other technologies and methods of delivery and storage, could have a negative effect on the Company’s businesses. Examples of the foregoing include the convergence of television broadcasts and online delivery of programming to televisions, video-on-demand platforms, tablets, satellite radio, new video and electronic book formats, user-generated content sites, Internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading, and place-shifting of content from the home to portable devices on which content is viewable outside the home. For example, devices that allow users to view or listen to television or radio programs on a time-delayed basis; technologies, such as DVRs, that enable users to fast-forward or skip advertisements or increase the sharing of subscription content; systems that allow users to access copyrighted product of the Company over the Internet or other media; and portable digital devices and systems that enable users to view programming or store or make portable copies of programming, may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the Company’s offerings to advertisers and adversely affect its revenues. Also, the growing uses of user-generated content sites and live and stored video streaming sites, which deliver unauthorized copies of copyrighted content, including those emanating from other countries in various languages, may adversely impact the Company’s businesses. In addition, further increases in the use of digital devices which allow users to view or listen to content of their own choosing, in their own time and remote locations, while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements or subscription payments, could adversely affect the Company’s radio and television broadcasting advertising and subscription revenues. Cable providers and DBS operators are developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment to highly targeted audiences, reducing the cost of creating channels and potentially leading to the division of the television marketplace into more specialized niche audiences. More television and video programming options increase competition for viewers and competitors targeting programming to narrowly defined audiences may gain an advantage over the Company for television advertising and subscription revenues. Television manufacturers, cable providers and others are developing and offering technology to enable viewers to locate digital copies of programming from the Internet to view on television monitors or other devices, which could diminish viewership of the Company’s programming. Generally, changing consumer behavior may impact the Company’s traditional distribution methods, for example, by reducing viewership of its programming (including motion pictures), the demand for DVD and Blu-ray Disc product and/or the desire to see motion pictures in theaters, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s revenues and profitability. Also, the impact of technological changes on traditional distributors of video programming may adversely affect the Company’s cable networks’ ability to grow revenue. Anticipating and adapting to changes in technology on a timely basis and exploiting new sources of revenue from these changes will affect the Company’s ability to continue to increase its revenue.

I-20

Piracy of the Company's Programming and Other Content, Including Digital Piracy, May Decrease Revenue Received from the Exploitation of the Company's Programming and Other Content and Adversely Affect Its Businesses and Profitability

Piracy of programming (including motion pictures), books and other copyrighted material is prevalent in many parts of the world and is made easier by the availability of digital copies of content and technological advances allowing conversion of such programming and other content into digital formats, which facilitate the creation, transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copies of the Company's content. Technological advances, which facilitate the streaming of programming via the Internet to television screens and other devices, may increase piracy. The proliferation of unauthorized access to programming has an adverse effect on the Company's businesses and profitability because these unauthorized actions reduce the revenue that the Company potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its products and services. In addition, if piracy were to increase, it would have an adverse effect on the Company's businesses and profitability. Also, while legal protections exist, piracy and technological tools with which to carry it out continue to escalate, evolve and present challenges for enforcement. The Company vigorously defends itself against entities that illegally secure and exhibit its content, including streaming the Company’s broadcast content without obtaining the consent of or paying compensation to the Company. Failure of legal protections to evolve and enable enhanced enforcement efforts to combat piracy could make it more difficult for the Company to adequately protect its intellectual property, which could negatively impact its value and further increase the Company's enforcement costs. 

The Company’s Businesses Operate in Highly Competitive and Consolidating Industries

The Company competes with other media companies for high quality content to achieve large audiences and to generate advertising revenue. The Company also competes for distribution on various MVPD platforms. The Company’s ability to attract audiences and advertisers and obtain favorable distribution depends in part on its ability to provide popular television programming and radio programming, motion pictures and books. The consolidation of advertising agencies, distributors and television service providers also has made competition for audiences, advertising revenue, and distribution more intense. In addition, consolidation among book retailers and the growth of on-line sales and electronic books sales have resulted in increased competition for limited physical shelf space for the Company’s publications and for the attention of consumers on-line. Competition for audiences and advertising comes from: broadcast television stations and networks; cable television systems and networks; motion picture studios; the Internet; new, non-traditional programming services; technological innovations in content distribution; terrestrial and satellite radio and portable devices; local, regional and national newspapers; direct mail; and other communications and advertising media that operate in these markets. Other television and radio stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming, a new station or new network may adopt a format to compete directly with the Company’s stations or networks, or stations or networks might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns. In book publishing, competition among electronic and print book retailers could decrease the prices for new releases and the outlets available for book sales. Moreover, the growing use of self-publishing technologies by authors increases competition and could result in decreased use of traditional publishing services. This competition could result in lower ratings and advertising and subscription and other revenues or increased promotional and other expenses and, consequently, lower earnings and cash flow for the Company. The Company cannot be assured that it will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing, new or potential competitors, or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.

The Loss of Affiliation Agreements or Retransmission Agreements Could Materially Adversely Affect the Company’s Results of Operations

The CBS Television Network provides its affiliates with up to approximately 98 hours of regularly scheduled programming per week. In return, the CBS Television Network’s affiliated stations broadcast network-inserted commercials during that programming. Loss of station affiliation agreements of the CBS Television Network could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations by reducing the reach of the Company’s programming and therefore its attractiveness to advertisers, and renewal of these affiliation agreements on less favorable terms may also adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. The non-renewal or termination of retransmission agreements 

I-21

with MVPDs or continued distribution on less favorable terms, could also adversely affect the Company’s revenues and its ability to distribute its network programming to a nationwide audience and affect the Company’s ability to sell advertising, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. Showtime Networks, CBS Sports Network and Smithsonian Networks are also dependent upon the maintenance of affiliation agreements with MVPDs, and there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed in the future on terms acceptable to such programmers. The loss of one or more of these arrangements could reduce the distribution of Showtime Networks’, CBS Sports Network’s and Smithsonian Networks’ program services and reduce revenues from subscriber fees and advertising, as applicable. Further, the loss of favorable packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing opportunities with any distributor could reduce revenues from subscriber fees. Also, consolidation among MVPDs and increased vertical integration of such distributors into the cable or broadcast network business have provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect the Company’s ability to maintain or obtain distribution for its network programming or distribution and/or marketing of its subscription program services on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

The Company’s Operating Results Are Subject to Seasonal Variations and Other Factors

The Company’s business has experienced and is expected to continue to experience seasonality due to, among other things, seasonal advertising patterns and seasonal influences, on people’s viewing, reading, attendance and listening habits. Typically, the Company’s revenue from advertising increases in the fourth quarter, Simon & Schuster generates a substantial portion of its revenues in the fourth quarter, and license fees for television programming and CBS Films’ revenue from motion pictures are dependent on the timing, mix, number and availability of the Company’s television programming and motion pictures, as applicable, which may cause operating results to increase or decrease during a period and create non-comparable results relative to the corresponding period in the prior year. In addition, advertising revenues in even-numbered years benefit from advertising placed by candidates for political offices. The effects of such seasonality make it difficult to estimate future operating results based on the previous results of any specific quarter and may adversely affect operating results.

Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect the Company’s Businesses and Customers

The U.S. and other countries where the Company operates have experienced slowdowns and volatilities in their economies. A downturn could lead to lower consumer and business spending for the Company’s products and services, particularly if customers, including advertisers, subscribers, licensees, retailers, theater operators and other consumers of the Company’s content offerings and services, reduce demands for the Company’s products and services. In addition, in unfavorable economic environments, the Company’s customers may have difficulties obtaining capital at adequate or historical levels to finance their ongoing business and operations and may face insolvency, all of which could impair their ability to make timely payments and continue operations, including distribution of the Company’s content. The Company is unable to predict the duration and severity of weakened economic conditions and such conditions and resultant effects could adversely impact the Company’s businesses, operating results, and financial condition.

Volatility and Weakness in Capital Markets May Adversely Affect Credit Availability and Related Financing Costs for the Company

Bank and capital markets can experience periods of volatility and disruption. If the disruption in these markets is prolonged, the Company’s ability to refinance, and the related cost of refinancing, some or all of its debt could be adversely affected. Although the Company can currently access the bank and capital markets, there is no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of financing for the Company. In addition, the Company’s access to and cost of borrowing can be affected by the Company’s short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by ratings agencies. These factors, including the tightening of credit markets, or a decrease in the Company’s debt ratings, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to obtain cost‑effective financing.

I-22

Increased Programming and Content Costs May Adversely Affect the Company’s Profits

The Company produces and acquires programming (including motion pictures) and other content and incurs costs with respect to its content, including for all types of creative talent, including actors, authors, writers and producers, composers and publishers of music, as well as for marketing and distribution. An increase in any of these costs and increased competition from new entrants into the market for the production and acquisition of new content may lead to decreased profitability.

Changes in Communications Laws or Other Regulations May Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Business

The television and radio broadcasting and distribution industries in the U.S. are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. The television and radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. For example, the Company is required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate its radio and television stations. The Company cannot be assured that the FCC will approve its future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full terms or will not include conditions or qualifications. The non-renewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of the Company’s licenses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s revenues. The Company must also comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies in the ownership and operation of its television and radio stations and its television networks. FCC regulations prohibit the common ownership of more than one of the top four networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, and limit the number of television and radio stations that a licensee can own in a market and the number of television stations that can be owned nationwide, which could restrict the Company’s ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require it to divest some television or radio stations. The U.S. Congress and the FCC currently have under consideration, and may in the future adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could, directly or indirectly, affect the operation and ownership of the Company’s radio and television properties. For example, from time to time, proposals have been advanced in the U.S. Congress and at the FCC to require radio and television broadcast stations to provide advertising time to political candidates for free or at a reduced charge. Any restrictions on political advertising may adversely affect the Company’s advertising revenues. The FCC has initiated a proceeding to examine and potentially regulate more closely embedded advertising such as product placement and product integration. Enhanced restrictions affecting these means of delivering advertising messages may adversely affect the Company’s advertising revenues. Changes to the media ownership and other FCC rules may affect the competitive landscape in ways that could increase the competition faced by the Company. Proposals have also been advanced from time to time before the U.S. Congress and the FCC to extend the program access rules (currently applicable only to those cable program services which also own or are owned by cable distribution systems) to all cable program services. The Company’s ability to obtain the most favorable terms available for its content could be adversely affected should such an extension be enacted into law. In response to the FCC’s March 2010 National Broadband Plan, which seeks to provide affordable broadband access throughout the U.S., Congress passed legislation in February 2012 authorizing the FCC to conduct voluntary auctions of spectrum utilized by broadcast television stations to provide additional spectrum for wireless broadband services. The television stations that continue their operations may have to change channels once the FCC “repacks” the broadcast spectrum dedicated to broadcast television use. Such auctions are expected to begin in 2016 followed by repacking, which could adversely impact the Company’s broadcast coverage and related revenues. It is difficult to predict the timing or outcome of the FCC’s actions or their effect, if any, on the Company’s broadcasting properties. Legislation could be enacted, which could remove over-the-air broadcasters’ existing exemption from payment of a performance royalty to record companies and performers of music which is broadcast on radio stations and could have an adverse impact on the cost of music programming for the Company. In addition, changes in or new interpretations of international laws and regulations governing competition and the Internet, including those affecting data privacy, may have an adverse impact on the Company’s international businesses and Internet properties. The Company is unable to predict the effect that any such laws, regulations or policies may have on its operations.

I-23

Vigorous Enforcement or Enhancement of FCC Indecency and Other Program Content Rules Against the Broadcast and Cable Industries Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Businesses and Results of Operations

The FCC’s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material on television or radio broadcast stations between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent material because of the vagueness of the FCC’s indecency/profanity definition, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming. The FCC enforces its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry. The FCC has found on a number of occasions that the content of radio and television broadcasts has contained indecent material. In such instances, the FCC issued fines or advisory warnings to the offending licensees. Moreover, the FCC has in some instances imposed separate fines for each allegedly indecent “utterance,” in contrast with its previous policy, which generally considered all indecent words or phrases within a given program as constituting a single violation. The fines for broadcasting indecent material per station are a maximum of $325,000 per utterance. If the FCC denied a license renewal or revoked the license for one of the Company’s broadcast radio or television stations, the Company would lose its authority to operate the station. The determination of whether content is indecent is inherently subjective and, as such, it can be difficult to predict whether particular content could violate indecency standards. The difficulty in predicting whether individual programs, words or phrases may violate the FCC’s indecency rules adds significant uncertainty to the Company’s ability to comply with the rules. Violation of the indecency rules could lead to sanctions which may adversely affect the Company’s businesses and results of operations. Some policymakers support the extension of the indecency rules that are applicable to over-the-air broadcasters to cover cable and satellite programming and/or attempts to increase enforcement of or otherwise expand existing laws and rules. If such an extension, attempt to increase enforcement or other expansion took place and were found to be constitutional, some of the Company’s cable content could be subject to additional regulation and might not be able to attract the same subscription and viewership levels.

The Failure or Destruction of Satellites and Transmitter Facilities that the Company Depends Upon to Distribute Its Programming Could Materially Adversely Affect the Company’s Businesses and Results of Operations

The Company uses satellite systems to transmit its broadcast and cable networks to affiliates. The distribution facilities include uplinks, communications satellites and downlinks. Transmissions may be disrupted as a result of local disasters including extreme weather that impair on-ground uplinks or downlinks, or as a result of an impairment of a satellite. Currently, there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming. If a disruption occurs, failure to secure alternate distribution facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses and results of operations. Each of the Company’s television and radio stations and cable networks uses studio and transmitter facilities that are subject to damage or destruction. Failure to restore such facilities in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses and results of operations.

Breach of Security Measures Regarding Information Systems Could Disrupt Operations and Damage the Company’s Reputation and Could Materially Adversely Affect the Company’s Businesses and Results of Operations

Network and information systems and other technologies are important to the Company’s business activities. Despite the Company’s security measures, network and information systems‑related events, such as computer hackings, cyber threats, security breaches, viruses, or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns or malicious or other activities, and natural or other disasters could result in a disruption of the Company’s services and operations or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information, which could damage the Company’s reputation and require the Company to expend resources to remedy any such breaches. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.

I-24

The Company Could Suffer Losses Due to Asset Impairment Charges for Goodwill, Intangible Assets, FCC Licenses and Programming

The Company will test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including FCC licenses, for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year and between annual tests if events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment. A downward revision in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible assets, including FCC licenses, could result in a non-cash impairment charge. Also, any significant shortfall, now or in the future, in the expected popularity of the programming for which the Company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of such assets. Any such impairment charge for goodwill, intangible assets and/or programming could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reported net earnings.

Dividends and Dividend Rates Cannot Be Guaranteed

The Company’s Board of Directors assesses relevant factors when considering the declaration of a dividend on the Company’s common stock. The Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to declare dividends, including at the same or similar rates.

The Loss of Key Personnel, Including Talent, Could Disrupt the Management or Operations of the Company’s Business and Adversely Affect Its Revenues

The Company’s business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of its chief executive officer and other key employees and entertainment personalities. The Company believes that the unique combination of skills and experience possessed by its executive officers would be difficult to replace, and that the loss of its executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, including the impairment of the Company’s ability to execute its business strategy. While the Company does not maintain a written succession plan with respect to Chairman of the Board, in accordance with the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, designated independent committees of the CBS Board together periodically review succession planning for the position of Chairman and report to the non-management directors of the CBS Board. Because approximately 79.6% of the voting shares are controlled by Sumner Redstone there can be no assurance now or in the future that he or the successors to the voting control may not seek to effect succession of the Chairman; however, and in all cases, the Board will elect the next Chairman by a majority vote of the Board. Additionally, the Company employs or independently contracts with several entertainment personalities and authors with significant loyal audiences or readership. Entertainment personalities are sometimes significantly responsible for the ranking of a television or radio station and, therefore, the ability of the station to sell advertising, and an author’s popularity can be significantly responsible for the success of a particular book. The Company’s cable networks, CBS Television Studios and CBS Television Distribution produce programming and CBS Films produces motion pictures with highly regarded directors, actors and other talent who are important to attracting and retaining audiences for their content. There can be no assurance that these entertainment personalities, authors and talent will remain with or be drawn to the Company or will retain their current audiences or readership. If the Company fails to retain or attract these entertainment personalities, authors and talent or they lose their current audiences or readership, the Company’s revenues could be adversely affected.

Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Rates Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company’s Results of Operations

Certain of the Company’s revenues are earned and expenses are incurred in foreign currencies. The value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, the Company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations.

The Company’s Liabilities Related to Discontinued Operations and Former Businesses Could Adversely Impact Its Financial Condition

The Company has both recognized and potential liabilities and costs related to discontinued operations and former businesses, certain of which are unrelated to the media business, including leases, guarantees, environmental liabilities, liabilities related to the pensions and medical expenses of retirees, asbestos liabilities, contractual disputes and other 

I-25

pending and threatened litigation. The Company cannot be assured that its reserves are sufficient to cover these liabilities in their entirety or any one of these liabilities when it becomes due or at what point any of these liabilities may come due. Therefore, there can be no assurances that these liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, operating performance or cash flow.

The Company Could Be Adversely Affected by Strikes and Other Union Activity

The Company and its suppliers engage the services of writers, directors, actors and other talent, trade employees and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. If the Company or its suppliers are unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements, it is possible that the affected unions or others could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages. Such actions, higher costs in connection with these agreements or a significant labor dispute could adversely affect the Company’s television, radio, cable networks, interactive and motion picture businesses by disrupting the Company’s ability to provide scheduled services and programming or by causing delays in the production of the Company’s television or radio programming or motion pictures. Depending on its duration, any lockout, strike or work stoppage could have an adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, cash flows and/or operating income and/or the timing thereof.

Political and Economic Risks Associated with the Company’s International Businesses Could Harm the Company’s Financial Condition or Results of Operations

The Company’s businesses operate and have customers worldwide. Inherent risks of doing business in international markets include, among other risks, changes in the economic environment, export restrictions, exchange controls, tariffs and other trade barriers and longer payment cycles. The Company may incur substantial expense as a result of the imposition of new restrictions or changes in the existing economic environment in the regions where it does business. In addition, acts of terrorism or other hostilities, or other future financial, political, economic or other uncertainties, could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures, which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.

NAI, Through Its Voting Control of the Company, Is in a Position to Control Actions that Require Stockholder Approval

NAI, through its direct and indirect ownership of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, has voting control of the Company. Mr. Sumner M. Redstone, the controlling stockholder, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of NAI, serves as Executive Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors, and Ms. Shari Redstone, the president and a director of NAI, serves as Vice Chair of the Company’s Board of Directors. In addition, Mr. David R. Andelman is a director of NAI and serves as a director of the Company. NAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require stockholder approval, including the election of directors and transactions involving a change of control. Other stockholders who may have different interests are unable to affect the outcome of the corporate actions of the Company for so long as NAI retains voting control.

Sales of Shares of Common Stock by NAI Could Adversely Affect the Stock Price

NAI, through its direct and indirect ownership of the Company’s Class A Common Stock, has voting control of the Company. Based on information received from NAI, shares of the Company’s voting Class A common stock and non-voting Class B common stock owned by NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC (“NAI EH”), a wholly‑owned subsidiary of NAI, are pledged to NAI EH’s lenders. NAI holds more than 50% of the Company’s voting Class A shares directly and these shares are not pledged. If NAI EH defaults on its obligations and the lenders foreclose on the collateral, the lenders or anyone to whom the lenders transfer the Company’s shares could sell such shares or convert those shares of voting Class A Common Stock into shares of non-voting Class B Common Stock and sell such shares, which could adversely affect the Company’s share price. Additionally, if the lenders foreclose on the pledged shares of voting Class A Common Stock, NAI will no longer directly or indirectly own those shares and such lenders or other transferees would have voting rights in the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that NAI 

I-26

or NAI EH at some future time will not sell or pledge additional shares of the Company’s stock, which could adversely affect the Company’s share price.

Many Factors May Cause the Stock Price of the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock to Fluctuate

The stock price of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock may fluctuate significantly as a result of many factors. These factors, some or all of which are beyond the Company’s control, include:

•actual or anticipated fluctuations in the Company’s operating results;

•changes in expectations as to the Company’s future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of securities analysts;

•success of the Company’s operating and growth strategies;

•investor anticipation of strategic, technological or regulatory threats, whether or not warranted by actual events;

•operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies; and

•realization of any of the risks described in these risk factors.

In addition, the stock market has experienced volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading prices of the Company’s common stock, regardless of the Company’s actual operating performance.

The Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities

So long as the Company and Viacom Inc. are under common control, each company’s businesses, as well as the businesses of any other commonly controlled company, will be attributable to the other company for purposes of certain rules and regulations of the FCC, U.S. and non-U.S. antitrust rules and regulations and certain rules regarding political campaign contributions in the U.S., among others potentially. The businesses of one company will continue to be attributable to the other company for certain FCC and other purposes even after the two companies cease to be commonly controlled, if the two companies share common officers, directors, or attributable stockholders. As a result, the businesses and conduct of Viacom Inc. may have the effect of limiting and affecting the activities, strategic business alternatives and business terms available to the Company, including limitations to which the Company contractually agreed in connection with the Company’s separation of former Viacom Inc. (“Former Viacom”) into two publicly traded entities, CBS Corporation and new Viacom Inc., which was completed on December 31, 2005 (the “Separation”).

In Connection with the Separation, Each Company Will Rely on the Other Company’s Performance Under Various Agreements Between the Companies

In connection with the Separation, the Company and Viacom Inc. entered into various agreements, including the Separation Agreement, a tax matters agreement dated December 30, 2005, which is filed as an exhibit to this report, effective as of the Separation (the “Tax Matters Agreement”) and certain related party arrangements pursuant to which the Company and Viacom Inc. will provide services and products to each other from and after the Separation. The Separation Agreement sets forth the allocation of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations of the Company and Viacom Inc. following the Separation, and includes indemnification obligations for such liabilities and obligations. In addition, pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, certain income tax liabilities and related responsibilities are allocated between, and indemnification obligations are assumed by, each of the Company and Viacom Inc. Each company will rely on the other to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements. Certain of the liabilities to be assumed or indemnified by the Company or Viacom Inc. under these agreements are legal or contractual liabilities of the other company. If Viacom Inc. were to breach or be unable to satisfy its material obligations under these 

I-27

agreements, including a failure to satisfy its indemnification obligations, the Company could suffer operational difficulties or significant losses.

Certain Members of Management, Directors and Stockholders May Face Actual or Potential Conflicts of Interest

The management and directors of the Company may own both CBS Corp. common stock and Viacom Inc. common stock, and both the Company and Viacom Inc. are controlled by NAI. Mr. Redstone, the controlling stockholder, chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer of NAI, serves as Executive Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors and executive chairman of Viacom Inc.’s board of directors. Ms. Redstone, the president and a director of NAI, serves as Vice Chair of the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Viacom Inc. Mr. David R. Andelman is a director of NAI and serves as a director of the Company. Mr. Frederic V. Salerno is a director of Viacom Inc. and serves as a director of the Company. This ownership overlap and these common directors could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the Company’s and Viacom Inc.’s management, directors and controlling stockholder face decisions that could have different implications for the Company and Viacom Inc. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between the Company and Viacom Inc. regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Separation and the relationship between the Company and Viacom Inc. thereafter. These agreements include, among others, the Separation Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement and any commercial agreements between the parties or their affiliates. On occasion, the Company and Viacom Inc. may compete with each other in various commercial enterprises. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if the Company and Viacom Inc. enter into any commercial arrangements with each other in the future. Each of Mr. Redstone and Ms. Redstone may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of his or her time between the Company and Viacom Inc. CBS Corp.’s certificate of incorporation contains provisions related to corporate opportunities that may be of interest to both the Company and Viacom Inc. CBS Corp.’s certificate of incorporation provides that in the event that a director, officer or controlling stockholder of the Company who is also a director, officer or controlling stockholder of Viacom Inc. acquires knowledge of a potential corporate opportunity for both the Company and Viacom Inc., such director, officer or controlling stockholder may present such opportunity to the Company or Viacom Inc. or both, as such director, officer or controlling stockholder deems appropriate in his or her sole discretion, and that by doing so such person will have satisfied his or her fiduciary duties to the Company and its stockholders. In addition, CBS Corp.’s certificate of incorporation provides that the Company renounces any interest in any such opportunity presented to Viacom Inc. These provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity of one of such companies may be used for the benefit of the other company.
