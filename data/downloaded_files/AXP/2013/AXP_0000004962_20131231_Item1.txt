 ITEM 1. BUSINESS  

 INTRODUCTION  

Overview  

American Express Company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries (American Express, the Company, we, us or our), is a global services company that provides customers with access to products, insights and experiences that enrich lives and build business success. Our principal products and services are charge and credit payment card products and travel-related services offered to consumers and businesses around the world.  

We were founded in 1850 as a joint stock association. We were incorporated in 1965 as a New York corporation. American Express Company and its principal operating subsidiary, American Express Travel Related Services Company, Inc. (TRS), are bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act), subject to supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve).  

Our headquarters are located in New York, New York in lower Manhattan. We also have offices in other locations in North America, as well as throughout the world.  

We are principally engaged in businesses comprising four reportable operating segments: U.S. Card Services, International Card Services, Global Commercial Services and Global Network & Merchant Services, all of which are described below. Corporate functions and auxiliary businesses, including the Companys Enterprise Growth Group, are included in Corporate & Other.  

We compete in the global payments industry with charge, credit and debit card networks, issuers and acquirers, as well as evolving alternative payment mechanisms, systems and products. As the payments industry continues to evolve, we are facing increasing competition from non-traditional players that leverage new technologies and customers existing card accounts and bank relationships to create payment or other fee-based solutions. We are transforming our existing businesses and creating new products and services for the digital marketplace as we seek to enhance our customers digital experiences and develop platforms for online and mobile commerce. Emerging technologies also provide an opportunity to deliver financial products and services that help new and existing customer segments move and manage their money, which we are pursuing through our Enterprise Growth Group.

2013 Highlights  

Our results for 2013 reflected healthy spending growth, continuing strong credit quality, effective control of operating expenses and a strong capital position. Compared with 2012, we delivered:  

       Total revenues net of interest expense of $33.0 billion, up 4 percent from $31.6 billion  

       Net income of $5.4 billion, up 20 percent from $4.5 billion  

       Diluted earnings per share based on net income attributable to common shareholders of $4.88, up 25 percent from $3.89  

       Return on average equity of 27.8 percent, compared with 23.1 percent  

Despite a challenging economic environment, billed business grew 7 percent over the prior year. Our average loans also continued to grow year over year. At the same time, lending write-off rates remained at historically low levels. While we expect lending write-off rates will increase from such levels, we have not experienced overall credit deterioration, as total delinquency rates remained consistently low during the year. We effectively controlled our expenses, while continuing to invest in growth opportunities in the United States and internationally.

For a discussion of our principal sources of revenue, see pages 65-66 of our 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders.  

Products and Services  

Our range of products and services includes:  

       Charge and credit card products  

       Expense management products and services  

       Consumer and business travel services  

       Stored value/prepaid products such as American Express Serve, Bluebird and Travelers Cheques  

       Network services

Table of Contents 

       Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale, marketing and information products and services for merchants  

       Fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design of customized customer loyalty and rewards programs  

Our various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including direct mail, online applications, in-house and third-party sales forces and direct response advertising.  

Our products and services generate the following types of revenue:  

       Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, which represents fees generally charged to merchants when Card Members use their cards to purchase goods and services at merchants on our network  

       Net card fees, which represent revenue earned for annual Card Memberships  

       Travel commissions and fees, which are earned by charging a transaction or management fee to both customers and suppliers for travel-related transactions  

       Other commissions and fees, which are earned on foreign exchange conversions, card-related fees and assessments and other service fees  

       Other revenue, which represents revenues arising from contracts with partners of our Global Network Services (GNS) business (including royalties and signing fees), insurance premiums earned from Card Member travel and other insurance programs, Travelers Cheques and prepaid card-related revenues and other miscellaneous revenue and fees  

       Interest on loans, which principally represents interest income earned on outstanding balances  

Our general-purpose card network, card-issuing and merchant-acquiring and processing businesses are global in scope. We are a world leader in providing charge and credit cards to consumers, small businesses and corporations. These cards include cards issued by American Express as well as cards issued by third-party banks and other institutions that are accepted by merchants on the American Express network (collectively, Cards). American Express Cards permit Card Members to charge purchases of goods and services in most countries around the world at the millions of merchants that accept Cards bearing our logo. At December 31, 2013, we had total worldwide Cards-in-force of 107.2 million (including Cards issued by third parties). In 2013, our worldwide billed business (spending on American Express® Cards, including Cards issued by third parties) was $952.4 billion.  

Our business as a whole has not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations, although Card billed business tends to be moderately higher in the fourth quarter than in other quarters. As a result, the amount of Card Member loans outstanding tends to be moderately higher during that quarter. The average discount rate also tends to be slightly lower during the fourth quarter due to a higher level of retail-related billed business volumes.  

Competitive Advantages of our Closed-Loop Network and Spend-Centric Model  

We believe our closed-loop network and spend-centric business model continue to be competitive advantages by giving us the ability to provide more value to Card Members, merchants and our Card-issuing partners.  

Wherever we manage both the acquiring relationship with merchants and the Card-issuing side of the business, there is a closed-loop, which distinguishes our network from the bankcard networks, in that we have access to information at both ends of the Card transaction. We maintain direct relationships with both our Card  

3  

Table of Contents 

 Members (as a card issuer) and our merchants (as an acquirer), and we handle all key aspects of those relationships. This allows us to analyze information on Card Member spending and build algorithms and other analytical tools that enable us to provide targeted marketing and other information services for merchants and special offers and services to Card Members through a variety of channels, while at the same time respecting Card Member preferences and protecting Card Member data in compliance with applicable policies and legal requirements.  

Our spend-centric business model focuses on generating revenues primarily by driving spending on our Cards and secondarily by finance charges and fees. Spending on our Cards, which is higher on average on a per-card basis versus our competitors, offers greater value to merchants in the form of loyal customers and higher sales. This enables us to earn discount revenue that allows us to invest in greater value-added services for merchants and Card Members. Because of the revenues generated from having higher-spending Card Members, we have the flexibility to invest in attractive rewards and other benefits to Card Members, as well as targeted marketing and other programs and investments for merchants, all of which in turn create incentives for Card Members to spend more on their Cards. The significant investments we make in rewards and other compelling value propositions for Card Members incent Card usage at merchants and Card Member loyalty.  

The American Express Brand  

Our brand and its attributes  trust, security, integrity, quality and customer service  are key assets of the Company. We continue to focus on our brand, and our programs, products and services are evidence of our commitment to its attributes. Our brand has consistently been rated one of the most valuable brands in the world in published studies, and we believe it provides us with a significant competitive advantage.  

We believe our brand and its attributes are critical to our success, and we invest heavily in managing, marketing, promoting and protecting it. We place significant importance on trademarks, service marks and patents, and seek to secure our intellectual property rights around the world.  

GLOBAL NETWORK & MERCHANT SERVICES  

The Global Network & Merchant Services (GNMS) segment operates a global payments network that processes and settles proprietary and non-proprietary card transactions. GNMS acquires merchants, provides point-of-sale products and services, and leverages our closed-loop network to offer multi-channel marketing programs and capabilities, services, and reporting and analytical data to our merchants around the world. It enters into agreements with third-party card issuers and acquirers, licensing the American Express brand and extending the reach of the global network.  

The majority of Cards bearing our logo are issued by our principal operating subsidiary, TRS, by the Companys U.S. banking subsidiaries, American Express Centurion Bank (Centurion Bank) and American Express Bank, FSB (AEBFSB), and by other operating and banking subsidiaries outside the United States. In addition, our GNS business establishes and maintains relationships with banks and other institutions around the world that issue Cards and, in certain countries, acquire local merchants on the American Express network. GNS is key to our strategy of broadening the Card Member and merchant base for our network worldwide. Cards bearing our logo are accepted at all merchant locations worldwide that accept American Express-branded Cards and, depending on the product, they are generally accepted at ATM locations worldwide that accept Cards.  

Our Global Merchant Services (GMS) business provides us with access to transaction and merchant data through our closed-loop network, which encompasses relationships with both the Card Member and the merchant. This capability helps us acquire new merchants, deepen relationships with existing merchants, process transactions, and provide targeted marketing, analytics and other value-added services to merchants on our network. In addition, it allows us to analyze trends and spending patterns among various segments of our customer base.

Global Network Services  

We continue to pursue a strategy, through our GNS business, of inviting U.S. and foreign banks and other institutions to issue Cards and, in some countries, act as merchant acquirers on the American Express network. By leveraging our global infrastructure and the appeal of the American Express brand, we broaden our Card Member and merchant bases for our network worldwide. This strategy also enables us to enhance our presence in countries where we already do business and expand our presence into new geographic areas at economic scale and cost levels that would be difficult for us to achieve on our own. The GNS business has established 148 Card-issuing and/or merchant-acquiring arrangements with banks and other institutions in 136 countries. In assessing whether we should pursue a proprietary or GNS strategy in a given country, or some combination thereof, we consider a wide range of country-specific factors, including the stability and attractiveness of financial returns, the size of the affluent segment, the strength of available marketing and credit data, the size of co-brand opportunities and how we can best create strong merchant value. For a discussion of our proprietary Card-issuing business, see U.S. Card Services and International Card Services below.  

In 2013, GNS signed five new partners to issue Cards and/or acquire merchants on the American Express network, including new card-issuing partnerships with Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank in the United States, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank in China, IndusInd Bank in India and Barclaycard in the United Kingdom. GNS also supported existing partners in launching approximately 95 new products during 2013, with the total number of American Express-branded GNS partner products standing at over 1,200. New products launched in 2013 include the Centurion® Card from American Express issued by Nedbank in South Africa, the TSB Avios Credit Card Account in the United Kingdom and the KB Kookmin Good Day Platinum American Express® Card in South Korea.  

GNS focuses on partnering with qualified third-party banks and other institutions to issue Cards accepted on our global network and/or acquire merchants on our network. Although we customize our network arrangements to the particular country and each partners requirements, as well as to our strategic plans in that marketplace, all GNS arrangements are designed to help issuers develop products for their highest-spending and most affluent customers and to support the value of American Express Card acceptance to merchants. We choose to partner with institutions that share a core set of attributes compatible with the American Express brand, such as commitment to high quality standards and strong marketing expertise, and we require adherence to our product, brand and service standards.**  

With over 1,200 different Card products launched on our network so far by our partners, GNS is an increasingly important business that is strengthening our brand visibility around the world, driving more transaction volume onto our merchant network and increasing the number of merchants choosing to accept the American Express Card. GNS enables us to expand our networks global presence generally without assuming additional Card Member credit risk or having to invest a large amount of resources, as our GNS partners already have established attractive customer bases to whom they can target American Express-branded products, and are responsible for managing the credit risk associated with the Cards they issue. Since 1999, Cards-in-force issued by GNS partners have grown at a compound annual growth rate of 21 percent, and totaled over 40 million Cards at the end of 2013. Outside the United States, approximately 80 percent of new Cards issued in 2013 were Cards issued by GNS partners. Spending on GNS Cards has grown at a compound annual rate of 23 percent since 1999, with spending on these Cards at $144 billion in 2013, up 12 percent from a year ago.  

GNS Arrangements  

Although the structures and details of each of the GNS arrangements vary, all of them generate revenues for us from the Card transaction volumes they drive on the American Express network. Gross revenues we receive  

 ** The use of the term partner or partnering does not mean or imply a formal legal partnership, and is not meant in any way to alter the terms of American Express relationship with third-party issuers and merchant acquirers.

 per dollar spent on a Card issued by a GNS partner are generally lower than those from our proprietary Card-issuing business. However, because the GNS partner is responsible for most of the operating costs and risk of its Card-issuing business, our operating expenses and credit losses are generally lower than those in our proprietary Card-issuing business. The GNS business model generates an attractive earnings stream and risk profile that requires a lower level of capital support. The return on equity in our GNS business can thus be significantly higher than that of our proprietary Card-issuing business. In addition, since the majority of GNS costs are fixed, the business is highly scalable. GNS partners benefit from their association with the American Express brand and their ability to gain attractive revenue streams and expand and differentiate their product offerings with innovative marketing programs.  

Our GNS arrangements fall into the following three main categories: Independent Operator Arrangements, Network Card License Arrangements and Joint Venture Arrangements.  

Independent Operator Arrangements. The first type of GNS arrangement is known as an independent operator (IO) arrangement. As of the end of 2013, we had 65 of these arrangements around the world. We pursue these arrangements to expand the presence of the American Express network in countries in which we do not offer a proprietary local currency Card. The partners local presence and relationships help us enhance the impact of our brand in the country, reach merchant coverage goals more quickly, and operate at economic scale and cost levels that would be difficult for us to achieve on our own. Subject to meeting our standards, IO partners are licensed to issue local currency Cards in their countries, including the American Express classic Green, Gold, Platinum and Centurion Cards. In addition, most of these partners serve as the merchant acquirer and processor for local merchants. American Express retains the relationship with multinational merchants. Our IO partners own the customer relationships and credit risk for the Cards they issue, and make the decisions about which customers will be issued Cards. GNS generates revenues in IO arrangements from Card licensing fees, royalties on Card Member billings, foreign exchange conversion revenue, royalties on charge volume at merchants, share of discount revenue and, in some partnerships, royalties on net spread revenue or royalties on Cards-in-force. Our IO partners are responsible for transaction authorization, billing and pricing, Card Member and merchant servicing, and funding Card receivables for their Cards and payables for their merchants.  

We bear the credit risk arising from the IO partners potential failure to meet its settlement obligations to us. This exposure arises when their Card Members make purchases at merchants on the American Express network or use the Card for cash advances at ATMs and we submit such transactions to the IO partner for settlement. We mitigate this risk by partnering with institutions that we believe are financially sound and will meet their obligations, and by monitoring their financial health, their compliance with the terms of their relationship with us and the political, economic and regulatory environment in which they operate. In addition, depending on an IO partners credit rating and other indicators of financial health, we may require an IO partner to post a letter of credit, bank guarantee or other collateral to reduce this risk.  

Examples of countries where we have entered into IO arrangements include Brazil, Colombia, Croatia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Peru, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey and Vietnam. Through our IO partnerships, we believe we can accelerate growth in Card Member spending, Cards-in-force and merchant acceptance in these countries.  

Network Card License Arrangements. The second type of GNS arrangement is known as a network Card license (NCL). At the end of 2013, we had 79 of these arrangements in place worldwide. We pursue these arrangements to increase our brand presence and gain share in countries in which we have a proprietary Card-issuing and/or merchant acquiring business and, in a few cases, those in which we have IO partners. In an NCL arrangement, we grant the third-party institution a license to issue American Express-branded Cards. The NCL issuer owns the customer relationships for all Cards it issues, provides customer service to its Card Members, authorizes transactions, manages billing and credit, is responsible for marketing the Cards, and designs Card product features (including rewards and other incentives for Card Members), subject to meeting certain standards. We operate the merchant network, route and process Card transactions from the merchants point of  

6  

Table of Contents 

 sale through submission to the issuer, and settle with issuers. The NCL is the type of arrangement we have implemented with banks in Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.  

GNS revenues in NCL arrangements are driven by a variety of factors, including the level of Card Member spending, royalties, currency conversions and licensing fees paid by the NCL issuer and fees charged to the NCL issuer based on charge volume, plus our provision of value-added services such as Card Member insurance products and other Card features and benefits for the NCL issuers Cards. As indicated above, the NCL issuer bears the credit risk for the issued Cards, as well as the Card marketing and acquisition costs, Card Member fraud risks, and costs of rewards and other loyalty initiatives. We bear the risk arising from the NCL issuers potential failure to meet its settlement obligations to us. This exposure arises when their Card Members make purchases at merchants on the American Express network or use the Card for cash advances at ATMs and we submit such transactions to the NCL partner for settlement. We mitigate this risk by partnering with institutions that we believe are financially sound and will meet their obligations, and by monitoring their financial health, their compliance with the terms of their relationship with us and the political, economic and regulatory environment in which they operate. In addition, depending on an NCL issuers credit rating and other indicators of financial health, we may require an NCL issuer to post a letter of credit, bank guarantee or other collateral to reduce this risk.  

Examples of NCL arrangements include our relationships with Wells Fargo in the United States, Lloyds Bank in the United Kingdom and Westpac Banking Corporation in Australia.  

Joint Venture Arrangements. The third type of GNS arrangement is a joint venture (JV) arrangement. We have utilized this type of arrangement in Switzerland and Belgium, as well as in other countries. In these countries, we join with a third party to establish a separate business in which we have a significant ownership stake. The JV typically signs new merchants to accept Cards on the American Express network and issues local and U.S. dollar-denominated currency Cards that carry our logo. In a JV arrangement, the JV is responsible for the Card Member credit risk and bears the operating and marketing costs. Unlike the other two types of GNS arrangements, we share management, risk, and profit and loss responsibility with our JV partners. Income is generated by discount revenues, Card fees and net spread revenues. The economics of the JV are similar to those of our proprietary Card-issuing business, which we discuss under U.S. Card Services, and we receive a portion of the JVs income depending on, among other things, the level of our ownership interest. Our subsidiary, American Express Overseas Credit Corporation Limited, purchases Card receivables from certain of the GNS JVs from time to time.  

Global Merchant Services  

Our GMS business builds and maintains relationships with merchants, processes Card transactions and settles with merchants that choose to accept Cards for Card purchases (Charges). We sign merchants to accept Cards and provide marketing information and other programs and services to merchants, leveraging the capabilities provided by our closed-loop network. We also offer point-of-sale products and services, support for Card acceptance, fraud prevention and other value-added services.  

Our objective is for Card Members to be able to use the Card wherever and however they desire, and to increase merchant acceptance in key geographic areas and industries that have not traditionally accepted the Card. We add new merchants to our network through a number of sales channels: an in-house sales force; third-party sales and service agents; third-party acquirers; aggregators; strategic alliances with banks and processors; the internet; telemarketing; and inbound Want to Honor calls (i.e., where merchants desiring to accept the Card contact us directly). As discussed in the Global Network Services section, our IO partners and JVs also add new local merchants to the American Express network.  

We continued expanding our integrated American Express OnePoint® program in 2013 by adding third-party agents to service many of our small- and medium-sized merchants in the United States. Under this  

7  

Table of Contents 

 program, third-party service agents identify potential new merchants and provide payment processing services to merchants on our behalf for Card transactions, while we retain the Card acceptance agreement with participating merchants, determine the merchant pricing, and receive the same transactional information we always have received through our closed-loop network. This program simplifies Card processing for small- and medium-sized merchants by providing them with a single source for statements, settlement and customer service. We have similar arrangements in Spain and Mexico.  

During 2013, we also launched a program called OptBlueSM in order to expand Card acceptance by U.S. small merchants that have a projected American Express charge volume of less than $1 million per year. Under OptBlue, a third-party acquirer or processor will have the Card acceptance agreement with the merchant and determine the merchant pricing. Small merchants who sign up through OptBlue will be able to work with a single source  the third-party acquirer  for all the major card brands the merchant chooses to accept. OptBlue acquirers will provide relevant merchant data back to us so we can maintain our closed loop of transaction data.  

GMS continues to expand the number of merchants that accept our Cards as well as the kinds of businesses that accept the Card in order to address Card Member needs. Over the last several years, we have focused our efforts on increasing the use of our Cards for everyday spending. In 1990, 64 percent of our U.S. billings came from the travel and entertainment sectors and 36 percent came from retail and other sectors. In 2013, only 26 percent of U.S. billings came from the travel and entertainment sectors. This shift resulted, in part, from the growth, over time, in the types of merchants that began to accept payment cards in response to consumers increased desire to use these cards for more of their purchases, our focus on expanding Card acceptance to meet Card Members needs, and increased competition for travel and entertainment sector spending.  

During 2013, we continued our efforts to bring Card acceptance to industries where cash or checks are the predominant form of payment. For example, we have made headway in promoting Card acceptance in industries such as construction, industrial supply and insurance. We also continued our drive to expand Card acceptance among small merchants and for retail, everyday, online and business-to-business spending categories.  

Globally, acceptance of general-purpose cards continues to increase. As in prior years, during 2013, we continued to grow merchant acceptance of Cards around the world and to refine our approach to calculating merchant coverage in accordance with changes in the marketplace. We estimate that, as of the end of 2013, our merchant network in the United States accommodated more than 90 percent of our Card Members general-purpose card spending. Our international spend coverage is more limited, although we continue to expand our merchant network in locations outside the United States. We estimate that our international merchant network as a whole accommodated approximately 80 percent of our Card Members general-purpose card spending. These percentages are based on comparing our Card Members spending on our network currently with our estimate of what our Card Members would spend on our network if all merchants that accept general-purpose credit and charge cards accepted American Express Cards.  

Discount Revenue  

We earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants for accepting Cards as payment for goods or services sold. The merchant discount, or discount rate, is a fee charged to the merchant for accepting Cards and is generally expressed as a percentage of the Charge amount. In some instances, an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the amount of the payment that the merchant acquirer (in most cases, TRS or one of its subsidiaries) pays to a merchant for Charges submitted. A merchant acquirer is the entity that contracts for Card acceptance with the merchant, accepts transactions from the merchant, pays the merchant for these transactions and submits the transactions to the American Express network, which submits the transactions to the appropriate Card issuer. When a Card Member presents the Card for payment, the merchant creates a record of charge for the transaction and submits it to the merchant acquirer for payment. To the extent that TRS or one of its subsidiaries is the merchant acquirer, the merchant discount is recorded by us as discount revenue at the time the transaction is received by us. We may  

8  

Table of Contents 

 also charge additional fees to merchants, such as a variable fee for non-swiped Card transactions or for transactions using Cards issued outside the United States and used at merchants located in the United States.  

Where we act as the merchant acquirer and the Card presented at a merchant is issued by a third-party bank or financial institution, such as in the case of our GNS partners, we will make financial settlement to the merchant and receive the discount revenue. In our role as the operator of the Card network, we will also receive financial settlement from the GNS Card issuer, who receives an issuer rate (i.e., the individually negotiated amount that GNS Card issuers receive for transactions charged on our network with Cards they issue, which is usually expressed as a percentage of the Charge amount). The difference between the discount revenue (received by us in the form of the merchant discount) and the issuer rate received by the GNS Card issuer generates a return to us. In cases where American Express is the Card issuer and the merchant acquirer is a third party (which can be the case in a country in which the IO is the local merchant acquirer or in the United States under our new OptBlue program with certain third-party merchant acquirers), we receive an individually negotiated network rate in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is recorded by us as discount revenue. By contrast with networks such as those operated by Visa Inc. (Visa) and MasterCard International, Inc. (MasterCard), there is no collectively set interchange rate on the American Express network and no fees are agreed or due between third-party banks or financial institutions on the network.  

The following diagrams depict the relationships among the parties in a point-of-sale transaction effected on the American Express network where we act as both the Card issuer and merchant acquirer and under an NCL arrangement where third-party financial institutions act as Card issuers:  

The merchant discount we charge reflects the value we deliver to the merchant and the investments we make in providing that value. We deliver greater value to merchants as compared to our competitors in a variety of ways, including through higher spending by our Card Members relative to users of cards issued on competing card networks, our product and network features and functionality, our marketing expertise and programs, information services, fraud prevention services, our dedicated client management group, and other investments that enhance the merchant value propositions associated with acceptance of the Card.

Table of Contents 

The merchant discount varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant does business, the merchants Charge volume, the timing and method of payment to the merchant, the method of submission of Charges and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the Card acceptance agreement signed with us (e.g., local or global) and the Charge amount. In the United States and Canada, we charge a different discount rate for our prepaid cards.  

In recent years, we experienced some reduction in our global weighted average merchant discount rate. The average discount rate was 2.51 percent and 2.52 percent for 2013 and 2012, respectively. Over time, changes in the mix of spending by location and industry, volume-related pricing discounts, strategic investments, certain pricing initiatives and other factors will likely result in further erosion of the average discount rate. In addition, differentiated payment models from non-traditional players in the alternative payments space (such as PayPal and Square) could pose challenges to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average discount rate or our ability to access transaction data through our closed-loop network.  

While we believe merchants that accept our Cards understand our merchant discount pricing in relation to the value provided, we do encounter merchants that accept our Cards, but tell their customers that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of the Card. Our Card Members value the ability to use their Cards where and when they want to, and we, therefore, take steps to meet our Card Members expectations and to protect the American Express brand, subject to local legal requirements, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) in the United States. We make efforts to limit Card suppression by focusing on acquiring merchants where Card Members want to use the Card; continuing to enhance the value we provide to merchants through marketing programs such as our Small Business Saturday® event targeted to encourage Card Members to shop at small merchants; and providing earlier and more frequent communication of our value proposition. We have the right, when appropriate, to terminate Card acceptance agreements with merchants who seek to suppress the use of our Card products. We have a client management organization dedicated to growing our merchants businesses and finding ways to enhance the effectiveness of our relationships with these key business partners. Most importantly, we recognize that it is the merchants choice whether or not to accept American Express Cards and that all merchants have numerous options given the intense competition from new and traditional forms of payment. Therefore, we dedicate substantial resources to delivering superior and differentiated value to attract and retain our merchants.  

The laws of a number of states in the United States prohibit the surcharging of credit card purchases. Conversely, there are certain countries in which surcharging is specifically permitted, such as Australia and certain countries in the European Union. The settlement by MasterCard and Visa of a U.S. merchant class litigation, which received final Court approval in December 2013, required, among other things, MasterCard and Visa to permit U.S. merchants, under certain terms and conditions, to surcharge credit cards, while allowing them to continue to prohibit surcharges on debit card transactions. Where permitted by local law, our Card acceptance agreements generally include a provision under which the merchant agrees not to discriminate against the Card, such as by surcharging higher amounts on purchases with the Card than on purchases with any other cards the merchant accepts or by imposing a surcharge only on Card purchases, but not on purchases made with other cards. We do not prohibit merchants from offering discounts to customers who pay with cash, check or inter-bank transfers (i.e., Automated Clearing House or ACH). In addition, we do not prohibit U.S. merchants from offering discounts or in-kind incentives to customers who pay with particular forms of payment, in accordance with the provisions of Dodd-Frank.  

In December 2013, we announced the proposed settlement of U.S. merchant class action lawsuits under which we would change our U.S. Card acceptance agreement provisions to permit merchants to surcharge American Express charge and credit Card transactions no more than the surcharge on other charge and credit cards or other forms of payment the merchant accepts, other than cash, checks, debit cards or inter-bank transfers. While we continue to believe surcharging is not a customer-friendly practice, this proposed settlement provides merchants with additional flexibility, while protecting our Card Members against discriminatory treatment and fees. We will not be required to put these contract changes into effect any sooner than the date that

 the settlement agreement receives final approval, including any appeal period. For more detail on the proposed settlement, see Legal Proceedings below, and for information on the potential impacts of surcharging on our business, see An increasing prevalence of surcharging by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations in Risk Factors below.  

Enhancing Merchant Satisfaction  

GMS is focused on understanding and addressing factors that influence merchant satisfaction, including developing and executing programs that increase Card usage at merchants, using technology resources and innovative marketing tools such as social media, and applying our closed-loop capabilities and deep marketing expertise. In the United States, we also offer our merchants a full range of point-of-sale solutions, including integrated point-of-sale terminals, software, online solutions and direct links that allow merchants to accept American Express Cards (as well as credit and debit cards issued on other networks and checks). Virtually all proprietary point-of-sale solutions support direct processing by (i.e., direct connectivity to) American Express, which can lower a merchants cost of Card acceptance and enhance payment efficiency.  

Our closed-loop network and relationships allow us to analyze merchant data and information on Card Member spending. This enables us to offer a range of targeted marketing services, network capabilities and special offers for the benefit of merchants and Card Members through a variety of channels. At the same time, we protect the confidentiality of Card Member information in compliance with applicable privacy, data protection and information security laws, rules and regulations (hereinafter, Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws), our privacy, data protection, information security and firewall policies, and other applicable legal requirements. We also work closely with our Card-issuing and merchant-acquiring partners to maintain the information that supports key elements of this closed loop, providing value to Card Members and merchants.  

In 2013, we continued to connect merchants and Card Members via our proprietary Card Sync technology and Smart Offer APIs. We expanded the benefits of connecting an American Express Card with Twitter to enable Card Members who connect their eligible Cards to use special Twitter #hashtags to make purchases.  

We offer fraud prevention services to merchants for transactions on the American Express network, and our subsidiary, Accertify, Inc., which we acquired in November 2010, is a leading provider of solutions that help merchants combat fraudulent online and other card-not-present transactions. Accertify provides a hosted software application that offers an extra level of security for transactions on any of the major payment networks, including American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover and PayPal, or using any other alternative payment method. Accertify also offers merchants the option to outsource their end-to-end fraud management process to Accertify and provides other value-added services.  

We also offer Merchant Financing, a set of financing products that provides qualified merchants with access to a convenient, attractively priced source of financing for their business needs through their relationship with American Express. The financing offered is a commercial loan, which is repaid automatically through the merchants daily Charge submissions and accompanied by low fixed fees.  

We continue to focus our efforts in areas that make use and acceptance of the Card more secure and convenient for merchants and Card Members. We participate in standard-setting bodies, such as EMVCo and PCI Security Standards Council, LLC, designed to help drive secure and interoperable payments globally. Our goal is to make it easier for merchants to accept our Cards, for Card Members to have seamless experiences at the point of sale, and for issuers and acquirers that have more than one network relationship to have uniform technology standards across their card products and platforms. These efforts are particularly important as emerging technologies enabled on contactless cards, mobile phones and new payment devices offer consumers new, convenient ways to pay for their purchases. For example, we offer a contactless payment feature embedded in certain Cards, which can provide speed and convenience for making everyday purchases with merchants such as Transport for London, which now accepts contactless payment cards on all of Londons 8,500 buses. During

 2013, we announced, along with Visa and MasterCard, a proposed framework for a new global standard to enhance the security of digital payments and simplify the purchasing experience when shopping on a mobile phone, tablet, personal computer or other smart device by replacing traditional account numbers with digital payment tokens for online and mobile transactions. The proposed standard, which will be developed and administered by EMVCo, would seek to reduce fraud in the evolving payments landscape by providing an additional layer of security and eliminating the need for merchants, digital wallet operators or others to store account numbers.  

Billing Disputes  

As the merchant acquirer, we have certain exposures that arise if a billing dispute between a Card Member and a merchant is settled in favor of the Card Member. Drivers of this liability are returns in the normal course of business, disputes over fraudulent Charges, the quality or non-delivery of goods and services, and billing errors. Typically, we offset the amount due to the Card Member against payments for the merchants current or future Charge submissions. We can realize losses when a merchants offsetting Charge submissions cease, such as when the merchant decides to no longer accept the Card or goes out of business. We actively monitor our merchant base to assess the risk of this exposure. When appropriate, we will take action to reduce the net exposure to a given merchant by establishing reserves of Charge payable holdbacks from a merchant, lengthening the time between when the merchant submits a Charge for payment and when we pay the merchant, requiring the merchant to secure a letter of credit or a parent company guarantee, or implementing other appropriate risk management tools. We also establish reserves on our balance sheet for these contingencies in accordance with relevant accounting rules.  

Global Network & Merchant Services  Competition  

Our global card network competes in the global payments industry with other card networks, including, among others, Visa, MasterCard, Diners Club International (which is owned by Discover Financial Services), Discover (primarily in the United States) and JCB and China UnionPay (primarily in Asia). We are the fourth largest general-purpose card network on a global basis based on purchase volume, behind Visa, MasterCard and China UnionPay. In addition to such networks, a range of companies globally, including merchant acquirers and processors and companies such as PayPal, carry out some activities similar to those performed by our GMS and GNS businesses. No other single entity engages on a global basis in the full range of activities that are encompassed by our closed-loop business model.  

The principal competitive factors that affect the network and merchant service businesses include:  

       The number of cards-in-force and amount of spending on those cards  

       The quantity and quality of the establishments where the cards can be used  

       The economic attractiveness to card issuers and merchants participating in the network  

       The success of marketing and promotional campaigns  

       Reputation and brand recognition  

       Innovation and investment in systems, technology, product and service offerings, particularly in online and mobile commerce, including through partnerships with leading companies in the digital space  

       The quality of customer service  

       The payments industry expertise and capabilities that can be provided to partners in areas such as customer servicing, loyalty and data analytics  

       The security of customer and merchant information  

       The impact of court orders and litigation settlements, ongoing litigation, legislation and government regulation

Another aspect of network competition is the recent emergence and rapid growth of alternative payment mechanisms and systems, which include aggregators (such as PayPal, Square and Amazon), wireless payment technologies (including using mobile telephone networks to carry out transactions), electronic wallet providers, prepaid systems and systems linked to payment cards, and bank transfer models such as ACH and wire transfers.  

New technologies, together with the portability provided by smartphones and tablets and evolving consumer behavior with social media and networking, are rapidly changing the way people interact with each other and transact business all around the world. Traditional and non-traditional competitors such as mobile telecommunications companies and aggregators are working to deliver digital and mobile payment services for both consumers and merchants. Competition remains fierce for capturing and maintaining online and mobile spend in the ever-increasing digital world, and alternative business models present a significant challenge. For example, aggregators like PayPal have the ability to provide payment services to merchants for multiple payment networks. In addition, new entrants to the digital payments space such as online, social media, telecommunications and technology companies represent additional competitive and potentially disintermediating factors in the card payment industry given the scale of their customer relationships, large cash reserves and other resources available to develop new platforms and technologies, and their strategies to use payments as a tool to support other sources of revenue.  

To the extent alternative payment mechanisms and systems, such as aggregators, continue to expand successfully, discount revenues and potentially other revenues, as well as our ability to access transaction data through our closed-loop network, could be negatively impacted. In the United States, alternative payment vehicles that seek to redirect customers to payment systems based on ACH continue to emerge and grow, merchants with recurring billing models actively seek to switch customers to payment through direct debits from bank accounts, and existing debit networks also continue to expand both on- and off-line and are making efforts to develop online PIN functionality, which could further reduce the relative use of charge and credit cards online. For a further discussion of the competitive environment in the emerging payments area, see Enterprise Growth Group  Competition under Corporate & Other below.  

Some of our competitors have attempted to replicate our closed-loop functionality. During the first quarter of 2013, for example, JPMorgan Chase announced it would partner with Visa to develop Chase Merchant Services. Efforts by some card networks, payment providers and non-traditional competitors to replicate the closed loop reflect both its continued value and the intensely competitive environment in which we operate.  

In some countries outside the United States, third-party processors and some acquirers offer merchants the capability of converting payment card transactions from the local currency to the currency of the cardholders residence (i.e., the cardholders billing currency) at the point-of-sale, and submitting the transaction in the cardholders billing currency, thus bypassing the traditional foreign currency conversion process of the card network. This practice, known as dynamic currency conversion, reduces or eliminates revenue for card issuers and card networks relating to the conversion of foreign charges to the cardholders billing currency. While we are starting to see more activity related to this practice, it is still not widespread. Our policy generally requires merchants to submit Charges and be paid in the currency of the country in which the transaction occurs, and we convert the transaction to the Card Members billing currency.  

In addition to the discussion in this section, see Our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry in Risk Factors below for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business.  

Global Network & Merchant Services  Regulation  

Local regulations governing the issuance of charge and credit cards have not been a significant factor impacting GNS arrangements with banks and qualifying financial institutions, because such banks and institutions generally are already authorized to issue general-purpose cards and, in the case of our IO arrangements, to operate merchant-acquiring businesses. Accordingly, our GNS partners have generally not had  

13  

Table of Contents 

 difficulty obtaining appropriate government authorization in the countries in which we have chosen to enter into GNS arrangements. As a service provider to regulated U.S. banks, our GNS business is subject to review by certain federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).  

As the operator of a general-purpose card network, we are also subject to certain provisions of the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act and the accompanying regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (collectively referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act). We conduct due diligence on our GNS partners to ensure that they have implemented and maintain sufficient anti-money laundering (AML) controls to prevent our network from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes. As aggregators and other third parties add merchants to the American Express network, we have expanded our due diligence to review the AML and know your customer policies and controls of those third parties, and retain the right to require termination of merchants Card acceptance under appropriate circumstances. Since American Express Company and TRS are each bank holding companies, our business is also subject to further regulation and regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve. For additional information about our regulatory status, see Supervision and Regulation below.  

Over the last decade, legislators and regulators in a number of countries have focused on the fees involved in the operation of card networks, including interchange fees paid to card issuers on certain card networks and the fees merchants are charged for card acceptance, as well as the rules and contracts governing merchant acceptance. The interchange fee, which is the collectively-set fee paid by the merchant acquirer to the card issuing bank in four-party payment networks like Visa and MasterCard, is generally the largest component of the merchant service charge payable by merchants for debit and credit card acceptance in these systems. By contrast, the American Express network does not have such interchange fees. For this reason, as well as the fact that Visa and MasterCard are the dominant card networks, regulatory focus has primarily been on such four-party payment networks. However, antitrust actions and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or terms of merchant rules and contracts could ultimately affect all networks as well as adversely impact consumers. Among other things, lower interchange and/or merchant discount revenue may lead card issuers to look for other sources of revenue from consumers such as higher annual card fees or interest charges, as well as to reduce costs by scaling back or eliminating rewards programs.  

In certain countries where regulations have led our competitors to lower their fees, we have made adjustments to our pricing to merchants to reflect local competitive trends. For example, reductions in bankcard interchange mandated by the Reserve Bank of Australia in 2003 resulted in lower merchant discount rates for Visa and MasterCard acceptance. As a result of these regulation-driven changes in the marketplace, we reduced our own merchant discount rates in Australia over time, although we have been able to increase billed business and the number of merchants accepting our Cards. We have seen selective, but increasing, merchant surcharging on our Cards in Australia in certain industries and, in some cases, on a basis that is greater than that applied to cards issued on the bankcard networks, which is known as differential surcharging. The Reserve Bank of Australia changed the Australian surcharging standards beginning March 18, 2013 to allow us and other networks to limit a merchants right to surcharge to the reasonable cost of card acceptance. This could lead to an increase in the number of merchants that differentially surcharge American Express Cards.  

In the United States, Dodd-Frank gave the Federal Reserve the authority to establish rules regarding interchange fees charged by payment card issuers for electronic debit transactions (which include transactions using a debit card or general-use prepaid card) and to enforce a statutory requirement that such fees be reasonable and proportional to the cost of a transaction to the issuer, with specific allowances for the costs of fraud prevention, as well as to prohibit exclusive network routing restrictions for electronic debit transactions. Reloadable general-use prepaid cards (but not those marketed or labeled as gift cards or gift certificates) are exempt from the interchange fee limitations provided they meet certain requirements. The Federal Reserves rule provides that the regulations on interchange and routing do not apply to a three-party network like American Express when it acts as both the issuer and the network for its prepaid cards, and is therefore not a payment card  

14  

Table of Contents 

 network as that term is defined and used for the specific purposes of the rule. As a result, American Express is not subject to this rule with regard to the prepaid cards it issues. A court case challenging the Federal Reserves debit interchange and routing rules alleges the interchange fees were set too high and the routing regulations are insufficient to provide the choices required by the law. See The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act may continue to have a significant adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition in Risk Factors below for further discussion of the potential impact resulting from the implementation of the Federal Reserves rule.  

Additionally, Dodd-Frank prohibits payment card networks from restricting merchants from offering discounts or incentives to encourage customers to pay with particular forms of payment such as cash, check, credit or debit card, provided that offers to encourage debit or credit card payments do not discriminate on the basis of the network or issuer. Further, to the extent required by federal law or applicable state law, the discount or incentive must be offered to all prospective buyers and must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed. Dodd-Frank also permits U.S. merchants to establish minimum purchase amounts of no more than $10 for credit card purchases, provided that the merchants do not discriminate between networks or issuers. Federal government agencies and institutions of higher learning are also permitted to establish maximum amounts for credit card purchases provided they do not discriminate between networks or issuers. As a result of Dodd-Frank, customers may be incentivized by merchants to move away from the use of charge and credit card products to other forms of payment with lower fees, such as debit cards, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  

In January 2012, the European Commission (EC) published a Green Paper (a document to begin a process of consultation toward potential regulation) covering a range of issues affecting the payments industry. The EC completed the consultation process and on July 24, 2013, issued its recommendations, which included draft legislation now under consideration within the European Parliament and Council (the EU Payments Package). The ECs recommendations included a number of proposals that would likely have significant impact across the industry and would apply either in whole or in part to us. The proposed changes include:  

       Price caps  The EC proposed capping interchange fees at 20 basis points for debit and prepaid cards and 30 basis points for credit and charge cards. Although we do not have interchange fees like four-party networks such as Visa and MasterCard have, the caps would be deemed to apply to elements of the financial arrangements agreed between us and each GNS partner in the EU. The discount rates we agree with merchants would not be capped, but the interchange caps could exert downward pressures on merchant fees across the industry, including our discount rates. The EC would exclude commercial card transactions generally from the scope of these caps.  

       Network rules on card acceptance  The EC proposed to prohibit honor-all-cards and anti-steering rules across all card networks. In addition, the draft proposals sought harmonization of surcharging rules so that, across the EU, transactions that are subject to the interchange caps may not be surcharged, but transactions falling outside the scope of the caps could be surcharged up to cost.  

       Network licensing  The EC proposed to require all networks, including three-party payment networks that operate with licensing arrangements, which would include our GNS business, to establish objective, proportionate and non-discriminatory criteria under which a financial institution could qualify to be licensed to operate on the network. In addition, the scope of network licenses would be required to cover the entire EU. These requirements are inconsistent with the flexibility and discretion that we have had to date in deciding when, where and with whom to grant a license in the GNS business.  

       Separation of network processing  The EC proposed to require card networks to separate their network processing functions (in which transactions between different issuers and acquirers are processed for authorization, clearing and settlement). This proposal does not apply to three-party payment networks, such as American Express, but may be deemed applicable in situations where a different GNS issuer and acquirer is involved in a transaction, which represent a very small percentage of transactions on our network. Further clarification of the applicability of this requirement is needed where, as with GNS, licensing arrangements do not give rise to inter-bank transactions or relationships.

Table of Contents 

The proposed EU Payments Package is currently subject to debate and amendment by the European Parliament and Council in a complex legislative process and will also involve the EC. It is too early to assess the exact scope and impact of any final legislation.  

The Payment Services Directive (PSD) prescribes common rules across the European Union for licensing and supervision of payment services providers, including card issuers and merchant acquirers, and for their conduct of business with customers. The objective of the PSD is to facilitate the operation of a single internal payments market in the EU through harmonization of EU Member State laws governing payment services. One provision of the PSD permits merchants to surcharge, subject to disclosure requirements, but also allows individual Member States to override this rule by prohibiting or limiting surcharging. To date, the Member States are split on whether they prohibit or permit surcharging, with countries such as the United Kingdom (which for a number of years has permitted it for credit card purchases), the Netherlands and Spain permitting it and other countries such as France, Italy and Sweden prohibiting it. All Member States permit merchants to offer discounts for particular forms of payment. In 2012, the EC commenced a review of the PSD, and its recommendations were included in the proposed EU Payments Package discussed above.  

The PSD complements another European initiative, the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), which is an industry-led initiative with support from EU institutions. Among other changes, SEPA involves the adoption of new, pan-European technical standards for cards and card transactions. Compliance with the PSD, SEPA and related requirements has involved significant costs to implement and maintain. In addition, the Consumer Rights Directive (CRD) prohibits merchants from surcharging card purchases more than the merchants cost of acceptance in those Member States that permit surcharging pursuant to the PSD. The CRD provides no guidance to merchants on how to assess the cost of acceptance or take into account the relative value of different payment methods. A cost-based limit on surcharging could result in merchants imposing higher surcharges on American Express transactions if, in the absence of clear guidance, merchants take the position that the cost of American Express acceptance is higher than other payment cards. These elements of the CRD may be superseded by proposals now under consideration as part of the EU Payments Package discussed above.  

Regulators in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Venezuela and the European Union, among others, have conducted investigations into, or initiated proceedings with respect to, interchange fees that are ongoing, concluded or on appeal. For example, in December 2007 the EC ruled that MasterCards multilateral interchange fees (MIF) for cross-border payment card transactions violate EC Treaty rules on restrictive business practices, which was upheld by the European General Court in 2012. In 2008, the EC opened formal antitrust proceedings against Visa Europe Limited in relation to Visas MIFs for cross-border consumer card transactions within Europe. In 2010, the EC accepted Visa Europes pledge to cut its cross-border debit card MIF to 20 basis points for four years and in May 2013 the EC published for comment Visa Europes proposed commitments to cut its cross-border credit card MIF to 30 basis points and change its rules on how cross-border interchange is applied.  

In some countries in Asia, governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed and/or to localize aspects of their operations. For example, card network operators in India must obtain authorization from the Reserve Bank of India, which has broad power under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007 to regulate the membership and operations of card networks. In Indonesia, bank regulations require participants in a card payment and settlement business to obtain a license and establish a local legal entity. Governments in some countries also provide resources or protection to select domestic payment card networks. The development and enforcement of these and other similar laws, regulations and policies in international markets may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in such countries and extend our global network.

U.S. CARD SERVICES  

As a significant part of our proprietary Card-issuing business, our U.S. banking subsidiaries, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, issue a wide range of Card products and services to consumers and small businesses in the United States. Our consumer travel business, which provides travel services to Card Members and other consumers, complements our core Card business.  

The proprietary Card business offers a broad set of Card products to attract our target customer base. Core elements of our strategy are:  

       Focusing on acquiring and retaining high-spending, creditworthy Card Members  

       Designing Card products with features that appeal to traditional and newer customer segments  

       Using strong incentives to drive spending on our various Card products and generate loyal customers, including our Membership Rewards® program and other rewards features  

       Participating in loyalty programs such as Delta SkyMiles, sponsored by our co-brand and other partners, to drive spending  

       Developing and nurturing wide-ranging relationships with co-brand and other partners  

       Promoting and using incentives for Card Members to use their Cards in new and expanded merchant categories, including everyday spend and traditional cash and check categories  

       Providing solutions to support the everyday business operations of our small business customers  

       Providing exceptional customer service  

       Providing opportunities to drive spending and loyalty programs in digital channels  

In August 2013, J.D. Power and Associates released its annual nationwide credit card satisfaction study and ranked American Express #1 in overall customer satisfaction among the top 10 largest card issuers in the United States, for the seventh consecutive year.  

Consumer and Small Business Services  

We offer individual consumer charge Cards such as the American Express® Green Card, the American Express® Gold Card, the Platinum Card® and the Centurion® Card, as well as small business charge Cards. We also offer revolving credit Cards such as Blue from American Express®, Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express, Blue Sky from American Express® and, for small businesses, Blue for Business® Credit Card and SimplyCash® Business Card. In addition, we offer a variety of Cards sponsored by and co-branded with other corporations and institutions for consumers and small businesses, such as the Delta SkyMiles Credit Card from American Express, TrueEarnings® Card from Costco and American Express, Starwood Preferred Guest Credit Card from American Express, JetBlue Card from American Express, Hilton HHonors Card from American Express and Lowes Business Rewards Card. For the year ended December 31, 2013, billed business from charge Cards comprised 58 percent of total U.S. Card Services billed business. We also offer deposit products directly to consumers through American Express Personal Savings.  

Centurion Bank and AEBFSB as Issuers of Certain Cards and Deposit Products  

We have two U.S. banking subsidiaries, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, which are both FDIC-insured depository institutions and wholly owned subsidiaries of TRS. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are regulated, supervised and examined by their respective banking regulators, identified in the table below. In addition, Centurion Bank, AEBFSB and their affiliates, including the Company and TRS, are subject to supervision, examination and enforcement by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB) with respect to our marketing and sale of consumer financial products and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial  

17  

Table of Contents 

 laws, including, among other laws, the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (the CFPA) and the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). Both banks take steps to maintain compliance programs to address the various safety and soundness, internal control and compliance requirements, including AML requirements and consumer protection laws that apply to them. A further discussion of the AML initiatives affecting us can be found under Supervision and Regulation below.  

Certain additional information regarding each bank is set forth in the table below:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 *  The risk-based capital standards for both the FDIC and OCC are substantively identical. Currently, a bank generally is deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6 percent, a total capital ratio of at least 10 percent and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 percent. As of the phase-in of the Basel III capital rules on January 1, 2015, a bank will be deemed to be well capitalized if it maintains a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5 percent, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8 percent, a total capital ratio of at least 10 percent, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5 percent and a new supplementary leverage ratio of at least 3 percent. For further discussion regarding capital adequacy, including changes to  

18  

Table of Contents 

    capital adequacy rules, see Financial Holding Company Status and Activities  Capital Adequacy under Supervision and Regulation below.  

Charge Cards  

Our charge Cards, which generally carry no preset spending limits, are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases of goods or services. Charges are approved based on a variety of factors including a Card Members current spending patterns, payment history, credit record and financial resources. Card Members generally must pay the full amount billed each month. Charge Card accounts that are past due are subject, in most cases, to a delinquency assessment and, if not brought to current status, may be cancelled. The no-preset spending limit and pay-in-full nature of these products attract high-spending Card Members.  

The charge Cards also offer several ways for eligible U.S. Card Members to pay off certain of their purchases over time. The Sign & Travel® feature permits eligible U.S. Card Members to extend payment for airline tickets, cruise ship tickets and other travel items purchased with our charge Cards. The Extended Payment Option provides eligible U.S. Card Members the ability to extend payment for eligible Charges above a certain dollar amount.  

Revolving Credit Cards  

We offer a variety of revolving credit Cards that have a range of different payment terms, interest rate and fee structures, rewards programs, and Card Member benefits. Revolving credit Card products, such as Blue from American Express®, Blue Cash Everyday® Card from American Express, Blue Sky from American Express® and Blue for Business® Card, provide Card Members with the flexibility to pay their bill in full each month or carry a monthly balance on their Cards to finance the purchase of goods or services. Along with charge Cards and co-brand Cards, these revolving credit Cards promote increased relevance for our expanding merchant network.  

Co-brand Cards  

We issue Cards under co-brand agreements with selected commercial firms in the United States. Attaining attractive co-brand card partnerships is intensely competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships can generate high-spending loyal customers. The duration of our co-brand arrangements generally ranges from five to seven years. Card Members earn rewards provided by the partners respective loyalty programs based upon their spending on the co-brand Cards, such as frequent flyer miles, hotel loyalty points and cash back. We make payments to our co-brand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. We expense amounts due under co-brand arrangements in the month earned. Payment terms vary by arrangement, but are monthly or quarterly. In some cases, the partner is solely liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the co-brand partners own loyalty program. As the issuer of the co-brand Card, we retain all the credit risk with the Card Member and bear the receivables funding and operating expenses for such Cards. The co-brand partner retains the risk associated with the miles, points or other currency earned by the Card Member under the partners loyalty program.  

Card Pricing and Account Management  

On certain Cards we charge an annual fee that varies based on the type of Card and the number of Cards for each account. We also offer many revolving credit Cards on which we assess finance charges for revolving balances. Depending on the product, we may also charge Card Members an annual program fee to participate in the Membership Rewards programs and fees for account performance (e.g., late fees) or for certain optional services. We apply standards and criteria for creditworthiness to each Card Member through a variety of means both at the time of initial solicitation or application and on an ongoing basis during the Card relationship. We use sophisticated credit models and techniques in our risk management operations. For a further description of our

The Membership Rewards program from American Express allows Card Members to earn one point for virtually every dollar charged on eligible, enrolled American Express Cards, and then redeem points for a wide array of rewards, including travel, retail merchandise, dining and entertainment, financial services and donations to benefit charities. A significant portion of our Cards by their terms allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Points generally have no expiration date and there is no limit on the number of points one can earn. A large majority of spending by eligible Card Members earns points under this program. Membership Rewards program tiers are aligned with specific Card products to better meet Card Member lifestyle and rewards program usage needs. American Express Card Members participate in one of three Membership Rewards program tiers based on their credit or charge Card.  

We believe our Membership Rewards point bank is a substantial asset and a competitive advantage. We continue to evolve Membership Rewards to provide innovative ways to use points. In 2013 we introduced a new Use Points for Charges feature in the American Express mobile app that gives eligible Card Members the option to use Membership Rewards points to pay for any eligible transaction above $1 once the charge appears on the Card Members statement. We also launched a new partnership with Verifone Systems, Inc. that enables eligible Card Members to use Membership Rewards points for their fares in certain New York City taxi cabs.  

When a Card Member enrolled in the Membership Rewards program uses the Card, we establish reserves to cover the cost of estimated future reward redemptions for points earned to date. When a Membership Rewards program enrollee redeems a reward using Membership Rewards points, we make a payment to the Membership Rewards program partner providing the reward pursuant to contractual arrangements. Membership Rewards expense is driven by Card Member Charge volume, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners. For more information on our Membership Rewards program, see Critical Accounting Estimates  Liability for Membership Rewards Expense appearing on page 47 of our 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  

Membership Rewards continues to be an important driver of Card Member spending and loyalty. We believe, based on historical experience, Card Members enrolled in rewards programs yield higher spend, stronger credit performance and greater profit for us. By offering a broader range of redemption choices, we have given our Card Members more flexibility in the use of their rewards points on a cost effective basis. We continue to seek to optimize the overall economics of the program and make changes to enhance its value to Card Members and to merchants. Our program is also valuable to merchants that become redemption partners as we bring them high-spending Card Members and new marketing channels to reach these Card Members.  

Card Member Special Services and Programs  

Throughout the world, our Card Members have access to a variety of special services and programs depending on the type of Cards they have. Examples of these special services and programs, some of which are fee-based, include:

As part of our effort to deliver additional value for existing Card Members, to provide services to our Card Members in places convenient to them and to attract new high-spending customers to American Express, we established American Express-branded airport lounges at two U.S. locations, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and McCarran Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada. Entry to the lounges is complimentary for Platinum Card and Centurion Card Members. In addition, we launched a multi-year partnership with ShopRunner to offer eligible Card Members free 2-day shipping at more than 80 online retailers. We also partnered with TripAdvisor to enhance the online Card Member experience by allowing Card Members in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia to connect their American Express Cards with their TripAdvisor profiles.  

OPEN  

In addition to our U.S. Consumer Card business, through AEBFSB we are also a leading payment card issuer for small businesses (generally, firms with fewer than 100 employees and/or annual sales up to $10 million). American Express OPEN (OPEN) offers small business owners a wide range of tools, services and savings designed to meet their evolving payment and business needs, including:  

       charge and credit Cards  

       rewards on eligible spend and business-relevant rewards redemption options  

       travel and concierge services  

       business, retail and travel protections such as employee card misuse protection, purchase protection and baggage insurance  

       up to 10 percent discounts at select suppliers of travel, business services and products through OPEN Savings®  

       expense management tools and reporting  

       online account management capabilities  

       resources to help grow and manage a business through the award-winning community-driven website, OPEN Forum®  

       client managers for our top spending and higher revenue clients to support business growth  

In 2013, we introduced ReceiptMatch(SM), a new feature that allows OPEN® Card Members to match images of Business Card receipts to transactions on their online statements.  

In addition to the products and services outlined above, OPEN engages in advocacy efforts on behalf of U.S. small businesses. These advocacy efforts include our OPEN for Government Contracts: Victory in Procurement® program to help small businesses obtain government contracts, programs designed to help women entrepreneurs grow and sustain businesses, and our efforts to increase awareness of the importance of small businesses in our communities generally. For example, in 2013, we led the fourth Small Business Saturday®, a day to increase consumer awareness and patronage of local businesses and their role in the economy and local neighborhoods.  

Card-Issuing Business  Competition  

Our proprietary Card business encounters substantial and intense competition in the United States and internationally. As a card issuer, we compete in the United States with financial institutions that issue general-purpose charge and revolving credit cards (such as Bank of America, Capital One Financial, Citibank, Discover Financial Services and JPMorgan Chase). We also encounter competition from businesses that issue their own private label cards or otherwise extend credit to their customers, such as retailers and airline associations, although these cards are generally accepted only at limited locations. In recent years, we have faced increasingly intense competition in the small business sector, as competitors have targeted OPENs customer base and our leadership position in providing financial services and other fee-based solutions to small businesses.  

21  

Table of Contents 

The largest competing issuers have continued to grow, in several cases by acquiring card portfolios, and also by cross-selling through their retail branch networks. Competing card issuers offer a variety of products and services to attract cardholders, including premium cards with enhanced services or lines of credit, airline frequent flyer program mileage credits, cash rebates and other reward or rebate programs, services for small business owners, teaser promotional interest rates and rewards points for both credit card acquisition and balance transfers, and co-branded arrangements with partners that offer benefits to cardholders.  

Most financial institutions that offer demand deposit accounts also issue debit cards to permit depositors to access their funds. Use of debit cards for point-of-sale purchases has grown as most financial institutions have replaced ATM cards with general-purpose debit cards bearing either the Visa or MasterCard logo. Debit cards were historically marketed as replacements for cash and checks, and transactions made with debit cards have typically been for smaller dollar amounts. However, debit cards are increasingly perceived as an alternative to credit or charge cards and used in that manner. Additionally, overdraft accounts can be used by our competitors to extend credit to customers when transaction values exceed monies available in a linked demand deposit account.  

As the payments industry continues to evolve, we are also facing increasing competition from non-traditional players, such as online networks, telecom providers and software-as-a-service providers, that leverage new technologies and customers existing charge and credit card accounts and bank relationships to create payment or other fee-based solutions. In addition, the evolution of payment products in emerging markets may be different than it has been in developed markets. Instead of migrating from cash to checks to plastic, technology and consumer behaviors in these markets may result in the skipping of one or more steps to alternative payment mechanisms such as mobile payments. For a further discussion of the evolving competitive landscape in the payments industry, see Global Network & Merchant Services  Competition under Global Network & Merchant Services above and Enterprise Growth Group  Competition under Corporate & Other below.  

The principal competitive factors that affect the card-issuing business include:  

       The features and quality of the products and services, including customer care, rewards programs, partnerships, benefits and digital resources, provided to customers, and the costs associated with providing such features and services  

       The number, spending characteristics and credit performance of customers  

       The quantity, diversity and quality of the establishments that accept cards  

       The pricing, payment and other card account terms and conditions  

       The number and quality of other payment cards and other forms of payment, such as debit cards and electronic wallets, available to customers  

       Reputation and brand recognition  

       The level and effectiveness of advertising investments and marketing and promotional campaigns  

       The nature and quality of expense management data capture and reporting capability, particularly for small businesses  

       The ability to manage credit and interest rate risk throughout the economic cycle and implement operational and cost efficiencies  

In addition to the discussion in this section, see Our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payments industry in Risk Factors below for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business.

Financing Activities  

The Company meets its funding needs through a variety of sources, including direct and third-party sourced deposits and debt instruments, such as senior unsecured debentures, asset securitizations, secured borrowing facilities and long-term committed bank borrowing facilities in certain countries outside the United States.  

American Express Credit Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of TRS, along with its subsidiaries (collectively, Credco) acquires or finances the majority of charge Card receivables arising from the use of corporate Cards issued in the United States and consumer and corporate Cards issued in certain countries outside the United States. Credco funds the acquisition or financing of receivables principally through the sale of medium- and long-term notes. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB finance their revolving credit receivables and consumer and small business charge card receivables, in part, through the sale of medium-term notes and by accepting consumer deposits in the United States. TRS, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB also fund receivables through asset securitization programs. The cost of funding Card Member receivables and loans is a major expense of Card operations.  

There is a discussion of our securitization and other financing activities on pages 37-41 under the caption Financial Review, and Note 7 on page 80 of our 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders, which portions we incorporate herein by reference. In addition, see Difficult conditions in the business and economic environment, as well as political conditions in the United States and elsewhere, may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations and Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs, access to capital and cost of capital in Risk Factors below.  

Deposit Programs  

Centurion Bank and AEBFSB accept deposits from individuals through third-party brokerage networks. AEBFSB also accepts deposits directly from consumers through American Express® Personal Savings, a set of deposit products, including High-Yield Savings and Certificate of Deposit accounts. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $40.8 billion in total U.S. retail deposits. Our deposit-taking activities compete with those of other deposit-taking organizations that source deposits through telephone, internet and other electronic delivery channels, brokerage networks and/or branch locations. We compete primarily in the deposit sector on the basis of rates and our brand and its attributes.  

Our ability to obtain deposit funding and offer competitive interest rates on deposits is dependent on the capital levels of our U.S. banking subsidiaries. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) generally prohibits a bank, including Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless (1) it is well capitalized or (2) it is adequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is less than well capitalized generally may not pay an interest rate on any deposit, including direct-to-consumer deposits, in excess of 75 basis points over the national rate published by the FDIC unless the FDIC determines that the bank is operating in a high-rate area. An adequately capitalized insured depository institution may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has applied for and been granted a waiver of this prohibition by the FDIC. Undercapitalized depository institutions may not solicit deposits by offering interest rates that are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on insured deposits in such institutions normal market areas or in the market area in which such deposits would otherwise be accepted. There are no such restrictions on a bank that is well capitalized (provided such bank is not subject to a capital maintenance provision within a written agreement, consent order, order to cease and desist, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its federal regulator). If a depository institutions federal regulator determines that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or is engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, the regulator may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized, require an adequately capitalized institution to comply with certain restrictions as if it were undercapitalized, or require an undercapitalized institution to take certain actions applicable to significantly undercapitalized institutions, all of which would adversely impact the institutions ability to accept brokered deposits.

Card-Issuing Business and Deposit Programs  Regulation  

Our charge Card, consumer lending and deposit operations are subject to extensive regulation. In the United States, we are subject to a number of federal laws and regulations, including:  

       The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (which generally prohibits discrimination in the granting and handling of credit)  

       The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (FACT Act) (which, among other things, regulates use by creditors of consumer credit reports and credit prescreening practices and requires certain disclosures when an application for credit is rejected)  

       The Truth in Lending Act (which, among other things, requires extensive disclosure of the terms upon which credit is granted), including the amendments to TILA that were adopted through the enactment of the Fair Credit and Charge Card Disclosure Act (which mandates certain disclosures on credit and charge card applications)  

       The Fair Credit Billing Act (which, among other things, regulates the manner in which billing inquiries are handled and specifies certain billing requirements)  

       The Truth in Savings Act (which requires certain disclosures about rates paid and other terms of deposit accounts)  

       The Electronic Funds Transfer Act (which, among other things, governs disclosures and settlement of transactions for electronic funds transfers and customer rights and liability arising from the use of ATMs and other electronic banking services and, after the enactment of Dodd-Frank, imposes a cap on debit card interchange fees and prohibits exclusivity arrangements for payment card networks)  

       The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the CARD Act) (which prohibits certain acts and practices in connection with consumer credit card accounts)  

       The CFPA (Title X of Dodd-Frank)  

       The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (which prohibits contacting customers on their cellular telephones without their express consent, and provides for significant statutory damages)  

       Regulation Z (which implements TILA and was recently amended by the Federal Reserve to extensively revise the open end consumer credit disclosure requirements and implement the requirements of the CARD Act)  

       Federal and state laws and regulations that generally prohibit engaging in unfair, deceptive and abusive acts and practices (UDAAP) in offering consumer financial products and services  

In the United States, certain applicable federal and state Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws govern the collection, use, sharing and safeguarding of customer information by financial institutions, including certain requirements related to security breach notification. Other countries in which we operate, including those in the European Union, also have certain applicable Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws that govern the collection, use, sharing and safeguarding of customer information by financial institutions, in some cases more stringent than the requirements in the United States. U.S. federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practices. In addition, a number of U.S. states, the European Union and many foreign countries in which we operate have significant consumer credit protection and disclosure laws (in certain cases more stringent than U.S. federal laws). Bankruptcy and debtor relief laws affect us to the extent that such laws result in amounts owed being classified as delinquent and/or charged off as uncollectible. As stated above, since American Express Company and TRS are each bank holding companies, our business is also subject to certain activity restrictions under the BHC Act and to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective AML programs. For a discussion of these and other regulations and legislation that impact our business, see Supervision and Regulation below.

Table of Contents 

American Express Company and its subsidiaries, including in particular our U.S. banking subsidiaries, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, and our other banking subsidiaries, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions. Changes in such laws and regulations or in the regulatory application or judicial interpretation thereof could impact the manner in which we conduct our business and the costs of compliance. We regularly review and, as appropriate, refine our business practices in light of existing and anticipated developments in laws, regulations and industry trends so we can continue to manage our business prudently and consistent with regulatory requirements and expectations.  

The regulatory environment in which we operate has become increasingly complex and robust, and supervisory efforts to apply relevant laws, regulations and policies have become more intense. Internal and regulatory reviews have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, changes to practices, products and procedures. Such reviews are also likely to continue to result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination and additional restitution to Card Members, and may result in additional regulatory actions, including civil money penalties. In October 2012, the Company, TRS, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB reached settlements with several bank regulators relating to certain aspects of our U.S. consumer card practices. In December 2013, TRS, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB reached settlements with the FDIC, OCC and CFPB to resolve regulatory reviews of marketing and billing practices related to several credit card add-on products. AEBFSBs settlement with the OCC replaced and terminated a public, written supervisory agreement with the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), which was then its primary federal banking regulator and continued to remain in effect following the transfer of supervision of AEBFSB from the OTS to the OCC. AEBFSBs settlement with the OCC also replaced and terminated the public consent order with the OCC entered into in connection with the October 2012 settlements. For a further description of the settlements reached in December 2013, see Legal Proceedings below.  

In January 2003, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, an interagency body composed of the principal U.S. federal entities that regulate banks and other financial institutions, issued guidance to the industry on credit card account management and loss allowance practices (the Guidance). The Guidance covers five areas: (1) credit line management; (2) over-limit practices; (3) minimum payment and negative amortization practices; (4) workout and forbearance practices; and (5) certain income (fee) recognition and loss allowance practices. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB evaluate and discuss the Guidance with their respective regulators on an ongoing basis as part of their regulatory examination processes, and, as a result, may refine their practices from time to time based on regulatory input. The Guidance has not had, nor do we expect it to have, any material impact on our businesses or practices.  

American Express Travel & Lifestyle Services  

American Express Travel & Lifestyle Services is focused on delivering premium travel and related services to Card Members and other consumers in the United States and internationally. Services are provided through travel counselors, consumer travel websites in nine countries and the U.S. American Express Travel Representative Network (which consists of independently-owned travel agencies that license the American Express Travel brand).  

The U.S. consumer travel website, amextravel.com, and our international websites offer a range of travel rates and discounts on airfares, hotels, car rentals, cruises and vacation packages, with offline customer service available. We also provide Card Members benefits in some countries, such as earning one extra Membership Rewards® point for each dollar spent when booking eligible travel using an American Express Card enrolled in the Membership Rewards program. In addition, Card Members are able to Pay with Points by redeeming Membership Rewards points for some categories of travel through our consumer travel websites, as well as through our travel and lifestyle counselors and the U.S. American Express Travel Representative Network.  

Additional services are offered to Platinum and Centurion Card Members. These exclusive travel benefits include the International Airline Program, which offers savings on a ticket for a companion when an international business- or first-class ticket is purchased using an eligible American Express Card on over 20 airlines, and Fine Hotels & Resorts, a luxury hotel program offering value-added amenities.

During 2013, the U.S. Consumer Travel Network and international consumer travel and lifestyle servicing teams were combined to form one global business unit, American Express Travel & Lifestyle Services. Additionally, we sold our wholesale tour operator business, which included our wholly owned subsidiary Travel Impressions. The remaining American Express-owned travel service offices were also closed in 2013 in order to focus on interacting with consumers via phone, email or online.  

American Express Travel & Lifestyle Services  Competition  

American Express Travel & Lifestyle Services competes with a variety of competitors including traditional brick and mortar travel agents, travel agencies that provide travel benefits to consumers through credit card issuers and other competitors of our proprietary Card business, online travel agencies and travel suppliers that distribute their products directly via the internet or telephone-based customer service centers. In recent years we have experienced an increasing presence of niche players that are seeking to capitalize on the growth in the luxury travel segment by combining luxury travel offers with concierge-type services. Because the travel business is broad, we also compete with travel agencies that provide both consumer and business travel services. For more information about the competitive environment in the travel business, see Global Business Travel  Competition under Global Commercial Services below.  

American Express Travel & Lifestyle Services  Regulation  

American Express Travel & Lifestyle Services is subject to domestic and international laws applicable to the provision of travel services, including: licensure requirements; laws and regulations regarding airline passenger protections such as the Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections rule issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation; and laws and regulations regarding airline passenger screening and registration such as the Secure Flight Rule issued by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. American Express Travel & Lifestyle Services is subject to applicable Privacy, Data Protection, and Information Security Laws, including certain requirements related to security breach notification, in the United States and other countries in which we operate, including those in the European Union. In addition, since American Express Company and TRS are each bank holding companies, our business is also subject to certain activity restrictions under the BHC Act and to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective AML programs. For more information about the applicable activity restrictions under the BHC Act, see Supervision and Regulation below.  

INTERNATIONAL CARD SERVICES  

We issue our charge and credit Cards in numerous countries around the globe. Our geographic scope is widespread and we focus primarily on those countries that we believe offer us the greatest financial opportunity. For a discussion of Cards issued internationally through our GNS partner relationships, see Global Network Services above.  

The Company continued to bolster its international proprietary Card business through the launch of a number of new or enhanced Card products during 2013. These are Cards that we issue, either on our own or as co-brands with partnering institutions. In 2013, among other new proprietary products, we announced or launched several new co-branded products, including Interjet in Mexico and Payback in Germany and India. We offer many of the same programs and services in our international proprietary Card-issuing business as we do in our U.S. proprietary issuing business. Also, as in the United States, we issue Cards internationally under distribution agreements with financial services institutions. Another example of our distribution partnerships is affinity cards with fraternal, professional, educational and other organizations. For instance, we have been successful in penetrating the affinity card segment in Australia, where we issue Cards with some of the largest professional associations in that country. In Australia, affinity cards are a substantial part of our consumer lending portfolio.

As in the United States, the Membership Rewards® program is a strong driver of Card Member spending in the international consumer business. Our redemption options include travel, retail merchandise, entertainment, shopping and recreation gift certificates, experiences, financial services and donations to benefit charities. In 2013, we continued to enhance our rewards programs in several countries, providing more flexibility in the way Card Members can use their rewards points and upgrading digital capabilities to give Card Members access to rewards through additional online channels as well as at the point of sale in select retail locations. We also offer the flexibility of payment for travel services by allowing International Consumer Card Members to use their Membership Rewards points to pay for their travel purchases and other charges in 15 countries outside the United States.  

We continue to build on our strengths and look for further opportunities to increase our presence internationally. In 2011, we acquired a controlling interest in Loyalty Partner, a leading marketing services company known for the coalition loyalty programs it operates in Germany and Poland, and more recently in India, Mexico and Italy. Coalition loyalty programs enable consumers to collect rewards points from a variety of participating merchants through just one program. Loyalty Partner builds coalitions, such as its Payback® program, and offers loyalty cards good for discounts and rewards at participating coalition partners. Merchants fund the consumer offers and are responsible for the accumulated loyalty points, and Loyalty Partner earns revenue from operating the loyalty platform and by providing marketing support. Loyalty Partner also provides market analysis, operating platforms and consulting services that help merchants grow their businesses. Using these services, participating merchants are able to run targeted and tailored campaigns across various channels. Loyalty Partner has deepened our merchant relationships in certain countries, added approximately 60 million consumers to our international customer base and expanded our range of rewards and loyalty marketing services. It also provides us opportunities to offer American Express products and services to new customer segments and develop new co-brand products, such as the Payback co-brand products in Germany and India mentioned above.  

International Card Services  Competition  

Compared with the United States, consumers outside the United States use general-purpose charge and credit cards for a smaller percentage of their total payments, with some large emerging-market countries only just beginning to transition to card usage in any meaningful way. Although our geographic scope is widespread, we generally do not have significant share in the countries in which we operate internationally. Our proprietary Card-issuing business is subject to competition from multinational banks, such as Banco Santander, Citibank and HSBC, as well as many local banks and financial institutions. We view Banco Santander and Citibank as our strongest competitors on a global basis, as they currently offer card products in a large number of countries.  

International Card Services  Regulation  

As discussed elsewhere in this report, regulators continued to propose and enact a variety of new regulatory changes to the payments industry during the course of 2013.  

In Europe, the EU continued in its efforts to work towards greater harmonization on a number of fronts, in particular in relation to payments, AML, consumer rights, data protection and information security. These pan-European initiatives have been supplemented by a broad range of consumer protection and transparency initiatives at an individual Member State level.  

In countries outside Europe, we have seen regulators initiate new regulations in relation to a number of key themes, particularly fairness (such as Canada), responsible lending (such as Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore), privacy and data protection (such as Australia, Canada, Mexico and Singapore) and financial crime.  

Regulators in a number of countries are shifting their focus from just ensuring compliance with local rules and regulations towards paying greater attention to the product design and operation with a focus on customers and outcomes. Regulators expectations of firms in relation to their compliance, risk and control frameworks  

27  

Table of Contents 

 continue to increase and regulators are placing significant emphasis on a firms systems and controls relating to the identification and resolution of issues.  

We expect this activity to continue in 2014. We continue to evaluate our business planning in light of changing market circumstances and the evolving political, economic, regulatory and media environment.  

GLOBAL COMMERCIAL SERVICES  

In our Global Commercial Services (GCS) segment, we provide expense management and travel services to companies and organizations worldwide through our Global Corporate Payments and Global Business Travel businesses. American Express is a leading provider of corporate payment solutions and a leading travel management company for businesses worldwide.  

GCS offers a wide range of expense management and travel-related products and services to companies worldwide, including:  

       A comprehensive offering of Corporate Card Programs, such as:  

       Corporate Cards: issued to individuals through a corporate account established by their employer and that many business Card Members use to manage travel and entertainment spending  

       Corporate Meeting Cards: provided primarily to corporate meeting planners as a tool to help companies control their meetings and events expenses  

       Business Travel Accounts (BTAs): centrally billed to and paid directly by corporate clients, BTAs are used by companies to pay for their employees travel expenses  

       A suite of Business-to-Business (B2B) Payment Solutions, including:

       Buyer-Initiated Payments (BIP): an electronic solution for companies looking to automate their accounts payable processes  

       A variety of business travel-related products, services and solutions, including:

Corporate Card Programs  

The American Express® Corporate Card is a charge card that individuals may obtain through a corporate account established by their employer for business purposes. Through our Corporate Card Program, companies can manage their travel, entertainment and everyday business expenses and negotiate more effectively with suppliers, among other benefits. We use our direct relationships with merchants to offer Corporate Card clients superior data about company spending, as well as streamlined dispute resolution. We issue local currency Corporate Cards in 64 countries and territories, and have Global U.S. dollar and Euro Corporate Cards available in 102 countries and territories. We also offer Corporate Cards issued through our GNS partner relationships in an additional 32 countries and territories. In 2013, we began issuing Corporate Cards with chip and signature technology to U.S. Corporate Card Members. Chip-enabled cards offer an extra level of transaction security by employing dynamic encryption technology, which makes it more difficult for unauthorized users to copy or access card information.  

With the heightened focus on cost containment, many companies are interested in our Corporate Meeting Card program which helps businesses control meeting-related expenses. It allows clients to capture meeting spending, simplify the payment process and gain access to data that supports negotiations with suppliers.  

American Express also partners with many other companies around the world to offer a number of co-brand Corporate Cards in various countries. To date, American Express has 13 Corporate Card co-brand partnerships issued in 14 countries and territories. These products, typically suited for mid-sized companies (defined in the United States as firms with annual revenues of $10 million to $1 billion worldwide), provide a range of rewards and benefits. GCP is focused on continuing to expand its business with mid-sized companies, which represent a significant growth opportunity. Businesses of this size often do not have a corporate card program; however, once enrolled, mid-sized companies typically put a significant portion of their business spending on the Corporate Card because they can gain control, savings and employee benefits.  

GCP offers the Savings@Work® Program to mid-sized companies in the United States, as well as similar programs globally, which provide companies with cash back and/or discounted pricing on everyday business products and services, such as car rentals, hotels, restaurants and courier services. Corporate Card Members can also take advantage of our Membership Rewards program to earn points that can be redeemed for air travel and hotel stays, as well as retail, home and recreation items. In select regions we also offer Corporate Membership Rewards that allows a company to earn points to redeem for enterprise-level rewards. Membership Rewards is an effective tool for encouraging Corporate Card usage, leading to greater expense control and savings.  

Business-to-Business Payment Solutions  

We offer a series of Business-to-Business Payment Solutions to help companies manage their spend. These solutions provide a variety of benefits to companies, including cost savings, process efficiency, improved cash flow and increased visibility on spend. In addition, our solutions offer control and security over business expenses. This type of spending by companies also helps to diversify our spend mix. The Corporate Purchasing Card helps large corporations and mid-sized companies manage their everyday spending. It is used to pay for everyday goods and business expenses, such as office supplies, industrial supplies and business equipment. We issue local currency Corporate Purchasing Cards in 29 countries. We also offer Corporate Purchasing Cards issued through our GNS partner relationships in an additional five countries.  

vPayment, which offers companies single-use virtual account numbers, allows corporate clients to make payments with enhanced controls, data capture and reconciliation capabilities. Charges are authorized for a specified amount during a designated time window. The solution automates reconciliation, eliminates manual check requests and interfaces with a clients enterprise resource planning, procurement and accounts payable systems. vPayment can be used as the form of payment throughout the stages of a typical procure-to-pay process.

Buyer Initiated Payments allows us to pay American Express merchants electronically on behalf of our clients, permitting our clients to have more control over their payments, extend their own days payable outstanding (or float), and increase their cash on hand. Examples of BIP purchases by our clients include hospital equipment, industrial supplies, and construction and building materials; airlines also use BIP for purchases of jet fuel. This solution is best suited for mid- to large-sized companies that want to convert from paper to electronic payments and optimize cash flow. BIP is currently available to companies in the United States, Canada and Australia. BIP Express, a Web-hosted version of BIP, is also available in Mexico and Germany.  

Online Capabilities  

GCP offers companies and individual Card Members the ability to manage their Corporate Card Programs, and offers companies the ability to manage their Business-to-Business Payment Solutions, on a 24/7 basis through a suite of secure Web-based online tools. American Express @ Work® provides clients authorized users online access to global management information to help them gain visibility into their spending patterns, as well as the ability to make changes to their Corporate Card, Corporate Purchasing Card, BTA and Corporate Meeting Card accounts. Card Members can use the online Manage Your Card Account tool to manage their individual Corporate Card account. Business-to-Business Payment Solutions also offers clients the option to use online access to manage their vPayment and BIP solutions.  

Global Corporate Payments  Competition  

The corporate payments sector is dynamic and highly competitive, with much overlap between corporate and consumer payment cards and services and competition increasingly intense at both the payment provider and network levels. We are seeing increased product and price competition from payment providers, including larger regional and national banks. Customers are increasingly seeking payment products that integrate with their expense management tools and support electronic payment methods. With respect to competition at the network level, both Visa and MasterCard continue to support card issuers such as Citibank, JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bank, including by improving data collection and reporting to meet customers requirements. In addition to product and price competition, other key competitive factors in the corporate payments business include global servicing capability, quality of data, and access to additional services, such as reporting and program management tools, and customer experience.  

Global Corporate Payments  Regulation  

The GCP business, which engages in the extension of commercial credit, is subject to more limited regulation than our consumer lending business. In the United States, we are subject to certain of the federal and state laws applicable to our consumer lending business, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the FCRA (as amended by the FACT Act), as well as laws that generally prohibit engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or business practices. We are also subject to certain state laws that regulate fees and charges on our products. In the United States, we are subject to certain applicable Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws, including certain requirements related to breach notification. Other countries in which we operate, including those in the European Union, also have certain applicable Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws, in some cases more stringent than the requirements in the United States. We are also subject to bankruptcy and debtor relief laws that can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us. As discussed above, along with the rest of our business, we are subject to certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective AML programs. For a discussion of this legislation and its effect on our business, see Supervision and Regulation below. In some countries, regulation of card practices and consumer protection legislation may apply to some corporate payments relationships.

Global Business Travel  

American Express Global Business Travel (GBT) offers globally integrated online, offline and mobile travel solutions, which are designed to help its clients service their traveling employees and manage and optimize their travel expenses. GBT has a presence in approximately 140 countries through its proprietary operations, joint ventures and an independent third-party network of American Express licensees. GBT provides the following services to its corporate clients, which include small to mid-size businesses, and large, multinational and global companies: full-service online and offline travel booking and reservation services and support; travel program management services; consulting services; and meetings and events management services. During 2013, we added or retained Global Business Travel clients in the United States and internationally, including Canadian Bank Note Company, European Commission, Fidelity National Financial, Inc., Lear Corporation and Western Union.  

As announced during the third quarter of 2013, we plan to create a new joint venture for our GBT business. It is expected that GBTs operations, business relationships and other assets would be held and operated by the joint venture. As presently contemplated, at the closing of the joint venture transaction we would maintain an approximate 50 percent ownership stake in the joint venture, while an investor group would own the remaining interest. The joint venture transaction is expected to create greater investment capacity for GBT to further enhance its suite of products and services, attract new customers and grow internationally. The proposed transaction remains subject to the execution of definitive agreements and receipt of regulatory and other approvals.  

In 2013, we launched several new technology-related programs and capabilities to support our corporate clients, including a new mobile version of AX CONNECT®, our traveler tracking and alert management system that provides travelers with alerts and travel information customized to their travel itinerary directly to their mobile devices.  

Global Business Travel  Competition  

GBT continues to adjust to the shift of its clients preferences, and the resulting shift of some volume, from high-touch personal service to online channels and automated servicing tools. GBT also continues to face intense competition in the United States and internationally from numerous traditional and online travel management companies, as well as from airlines direct-to-consumer business, other travel suppliers, accredited in-house corporate travel agents and new entrants to the travel industry. Competition among travel management companies is mainly based on price, service, value creation, convenience, global capabilities and proximity to the customer.  

For many years, consumer and business travel agencies (including travel management companies) have faced pressure on revenues from airlines, as most airlines have stopped paying base commissions to travel agents for tickets sold and significantly reduced other forms of travel agent compensation. Airlines have also made efforts to increase the number of transactions booked directly through their websites. These trends have reduced the revenue opportunities for travel management companies because they do not receive distribution revenue from transactions booked directly with the airlines. In recent years, the airline industry has undergone bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations and other similar events including expanded grants of antitrust immunity to airline alliances. This antitrust immunity enables otherwise independent airlines to closely coordinate their international operations and to launch highly integrated joint ventures in transatlantic and other regions. These types of structural changes may result in additional challenges to travel management companies. For additional information concerning these issues, see Risk Factors below.  

Overall, intense competition among travel management companies, the ongoing trends of increased bookings directly with airlines, the rise of low-cost carriers, ongoing reductions in or elimination of airline commissions and fees, and the shift of customer preferences to online channels and automated servicing tools continue to put pressure on revenue and profitability for travel agencies.

Table of Contents 

As noted above, because the travel business is broad, GBT also competes with travel agencies that provide both consumer and business travel services. See American Express Travel & Lifestyle Services  Competition under U.S. Card Services above for additional information on the competitive environment in the travel business.  

Global Business Travel  Regulation  

The GBT business is subject to domestic and international laws applicable to the provision of travel services, including licensure requirements; laws and regulations regarding airline passenger protections such as the Enhancing Airline Passenger Protections rule issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation; and regulations regarding airline passenger screening and registration such as the Secure Flight Rule issued by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. We are subject to applicable Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws, including certain requirements related to security breach notification, in the United States and other countries in which we operate, including those in the European Union. We are also subject to bankruptcy and debtor relief laws that can affect our ability to collect amounts owed to us. In addition, since American Express Company and TRS are each bank holding companies, GBT is also subject to certain activity restrictions under the BHC Act and certain provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, with regard to maintaining effective AML programs. For more information about the applicable activity restrictions under the BHC Act, see Supervision and Regulation below.  

CORPORATE & OTHER  

Corporate & Other consists of corporate functions and auxiliary businesses, including the Companys Enterprise Growth Group as well as other company operations. We also discuss information relevant to the Company as a whole in this section. Our publishing business, which had previously been included in Corporate & Other, was sold to Time Inc. on October 1, 2013.  

As discussed in Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity on page 35 of our 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders, our corporate liquidity objective is to maintain access to cash, readily-marketable securities and contingent sources of liquidity, such that we can continuously meet expected future financing obligations and business requirements for at least a twelve-month period, even in the event we are unable to raise new funds under regular funding programs during a substantial weakening in economic conditions. A large portion of the interest expense in Corporate & Other includes the interest expense related to maintaining this liquidity pool since all of our businesses benefit from the liquidity, as well as interest expense related to other corporate indebtedness.  

Enterprise Growth Group  

The Enterprise Growth Group was established to pursue new forms of payments and digital commerce that open American Express to new customer segments across the world. This includes driving adoption of our Serve® software platform, expanding alternative mobile and online payment services, growing our prepaid products, forming new partnerships and building new revenue streams beyond the traditional Card and travel businesses. We believe the assets we have, together with emerging technologies, can, among other things, provide us the capabilities to deliver products that offer a competitive and differentiated value proposition compared to alternative financial services, such as check cashers, money order services and traditional retail branch banks. The convergence of software platforms and increasing mobile phone penetration across the world provides an opportunity to deliver financial products and services that help new and existing customer segments move and manage their money.  

Enterprise Growth offers a wide range of payment products, including American Express Serve, a full service reloadable prepaid card; Bluebird®, our alternative to checking/debit product with Walmart; other general  

32  

Table of Contents 

 purpose reloadable prepaid cards; single load prepaid cards, such as the American Express® Gift Card, rebate cards and B2B prepaid cards; and Travelers Cheques. In 2013, we re-launched the American Express Serve product with a free cash reloading network at over 14,000 locations and expanded capabilities including direct deposit, mobile check capture and personal financial management tools. As part of the re-launch, we introduced a $1 monthly fee, which will be waived if customers use direct deposit to load their Serve prepaid account or add $500 or more per month. We also expanded the funding capabilities of Bluebird during 2013 and announced that all funds in permanent Serve and Bluebird accounts are eligible for FDIC pass-through insurance.  

We are able to leverage the Serve software platform to offer different capabilities and feature sets for a number of our payment products. The Serve software platform unifies multiple funding sources and payment options into a single account, enabling customers to load cash, pay bills, manage budgets, write pre-authorized checks, send peer-to-peer payments and pay for goods both offline and online. Customers can access their account online, via a mobile app, as well as by using a physical card to make purchases at merchants that accept American Express Cards. In addition to direct-to-consumer distribution of our payment products, we have established business relationships in the mobile and gaming spaces to drive adoption of the Serve software platform. For example, as a result of our partnership with the Lianlian Group, the mobile top-up company has leveraged the Serve software platform in connection with the processing of certain top-up transactions in nine provinces in China as of the end of 2013.  

In addition, we have been selling the American Express® Travelers Cheque since 1891. Travelers Cheques are currently available in U.S. dollars and six foreign currencies. Sales of Travelers Cheques and net interest income from the Travelers Cheque investment portfolio continued to decline in 2013. We also issue general purpose reloadable prepaid travel cards denominated in U.S. dollars, euro and pound sterling in Australia, Brazil, China, India and South Africa and in U.S. dollars in the United States.  

Enterprise Growth also manages LoyaltyEdge®, a private-labeled loyalty solution, our foreign exchange services and the online flash sales site, vente-privee USA LLC, a joint venture between American Express and vente-privee.com, Europes leader in online private sales. During 2013, LoyaltyEdge launched programs with Wells Fargo and First Bankcard, a division of First National Bank of Omaha, while expanding its suite of services to include analytics, marketing and point-earn management. Our foreign exchange services consist of retail and wholesale currency exchange services and our FX International Payments operation, a service that allows customers to make cross-border payments for goods and services.  

Enterprise Growth Group  Competition  

Our payment products compete with a wide variety of financial payment products including cash, foreign currency, checks, other brands of travelers checks, credit, charge, debit, prepaid and ATM cards, bank accounts, alternative financial services such as check cashing and money orders, store branded gift cards, other network branded cards and other payment accounts and services. The principal competitive factors vary depending on the type of product, but some are:  

       Number and location of merchants accepting the form of payment  

       Availability to the consumer of other forms of payment  

       Amount of fees charged to the consumer or merchant  

       Compensation paid to, and frequency of settlement by, selling outlets  

       Accessibility of sales and refunds for the products  

       Success of marketing and promotional campaigns  

       Ability to service the customer and/or merchant satisfactorily, including for lost or stolen instruments  

       Availability of the service via multiple access devices, including mobile

The alternative payments sector is particularly dynamic and highly competitive, with a variety of different competitors that offer or are developing payment systems in e-commerce and across mobile devices, and with frequent product introductions in response to evolving consumer habits and merchant needs. These competitors include traditional financial institutions, such as payment card issuers and networks, banking institutions, alternative financial services providers, and increasingly alternative payment providers, such as PayPal, Google Wallet and Square, as well as other non-traditional industry players, such as mobile operators, handset manufacturers, technology companies, retailers and other start-ups and new entrants to the payments industry. Partnerships are also being formed among various competitors, such as partnerships between PayPal and Discover or between Square and Starbucks, and merchant coalitions like the Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX). Among other services, these competitors provide or are seeking to develop digital payment and/or stored value capabilities that can be used to buy and sell goods online, that can make more efficient the movement and management of money, alternative point-of-sale systems that enable digital payments at the physical point of sale, and services that support payments to and from deposit accounts or proprietary accounts for digital, mobile commerce and other applications. A number of competitors rely principally on the internet, mobile devices, and wireless communication networks to support their services, and may enjoy lower costs than we do. Other competitors working to deliver digital and mobile payment services may have and may deploy substantially greater cash reserves and other financial resources than we have or may offer a wider range of services and capabilities than we offer. Other competitors may also have relationships and licenses that enable easier market entry, particularly in countries outside the United States. Consumer and merchant adoption is a key competitive factor and our competitors may develop platforms or technologies that become more widely adopted than ours. Micro-payments on social networks and emerging digital currency systems are relatively small today but have the potential to grow rapidly, representing the possibility for competition from these new payment forms and protocols. Competition will remain fierce as payment services and technologies continue to evolve.  

Enterprise Growth Group  Regulation  

As an issuer of prepaid cards and Travelers Cheques, we are regulated in the United States under the money transmitter or sale of check laws in effect in most states. These laws require issuers to meet certain safety and soundness criteria, to hold outstanding proceeds of sale in highly rated and secure investments, and to provide detailed reports. We hold the funds received for prepaid cards and Travelers Cheques in accordance with applicable law, predominantly in highly rated debt securities consisting primarily of intermediate- and long-term federal, state and municipal obligations and bank deposit accounts. Many states examine licensees annually.  

In addition, the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires, among other things, the registration of travelers check issuers and the providers of foreign exchange services as Money Service Businesses and compliance with applicable AML recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Further, the Bank Secrecy Act requires that we maintain an effective AML program for prepaid products. Outside the United States, there are varying licensing and AML requirements, including some that are similar to those in the United States.  

Prepaid card and travelers check issuers are required by the laws of many states to comply with state unclaimed and abandoned property laws, under which such issuers must pay to states the face amount of any travelers check or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after a period of time depending on the type of product. In recent years, a number of states have passed legislation establishing shorter periods for travelers checks and/or prepaid cards, often with retroactive application. We have challenged, and intend to continue to challenge, what we believe are significant defects in these laws, which can have a significant impact on our Travelers Cheques and prepaid cards business in the states in which they are enacted.  

More generally, we continuously monitor state legislative activity concerning any of our prepaid offerings. In certain states where regulation continues to restrict fees and has made it unprofitable for us to offer prepaid cards, we have either limited or withdrawn from selling in these states.

The Global Services Group  

The Global Services Group (Global Services) was created to heighten the Companys focus on customer service and to ensure all business operations are managed as effectively and efficiently as possible. We have organized support functions by process rather than business unit, which the Company believes serves to streamline costs, reduce duplication of work, better integrate skills and expertise, and improve customer service.  

Global Services comprised principally the following divisions:  

World Service  

Our U.S. and international service organizations are consolidated under World Service. Our customer service units have worked over a number of years to ensure outstanding service to customers, while at the same time improving operating margins. As mentioned above, J.D. Power and Associates released its annual nationwide credit card satisfaction study and ranked American Express highest in overall satisfaction among 10 of the largest card issuers in the United States for the seventh consecutive year.  

Global Business Services  

The Global Business Services division is a shared services organization that includes procurement, real estate, financial operations and processing, and business transformation. These internal process-driven activities are consolidated to simplify and standardize processes for increased quality, efficiency and cost savings.  

Global Credit Administration  

Global Credit Administration (GCA) is responsible for the end-to-end management of our credit, collections and fraud operations around the world. GCA aims to strike the right balance between helping Card Members in need through a range of repayment options, and taking actions to recover balances and limit exposure for American Express.  

Technologies  

We continue to make investments in our systems and infrastructure to allow faster introduction and greater differentiation of products, while maintaining the security of customer data. We also use technology to develop and improve our service capabilities to continue to deliver a high quality customer experience. For example, we maintain a service delivery platform that our employees use in the Card business to support a variety of customer servicing and account management activities such as account maintenance, updating of Card Member information, the addition of new Cards to an account and resolving customer satisfaction issues.  

We continue to devote resources to our technology platforms to ensure a high level of data integrity, information security, data protection and privacy. Our internal IT organization retains key technology competencies, such as information technology strategy and information security, while outsourcing most of our technology infrastructure management and application development and maintenance to third-party service providers. This enables us to benefit from third-party expertise and lower information technology costs per transaction. We continue our efforts to safeguard the data entrusted to us in accordance with our internal policies and applicable Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws, as described under Supervision and Regulation  Privacy and Data Protection below.  

We continue to leverage online channels to lower costs, improve service quality and enhance our business model. As of the end of 2013, customers had enrolled approximately 31 million accounts globally in our online account management capability at americanexpress.com. This service enables Card Members to review all of their card transactions online (whether via desktop, tablet or mobile device), pay their American Express bills electronically, view and service their Membership Rewards program accounts and conduct various other

 functions quickly and securely online in accordance with applicable Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws. We now have an online presence in 22 countries around the world, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom. We also have a presence on social media networks, such as Facebook, Foursquare and Twitter, which provide us with another channel to communicate and interact with our Card Members.  

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION  

Overview  

Federal and state banking laws, regulations and policies extensively regulate the Company, TRS, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, including prescribing standards relating to capital, earnings, liquidity, stress tests, resolution planning, dividends, the repurchase or redemption of shares, loans or extension of credit to affiliates and insiders, corporate governance, internal controls, information systems, risk management, internal audit systems, compensation, loan documentation, credit underwriting, asset growth and impaired assets, among other things. Such laws and regulations are intended primarily for the protection of our depositors and other customers and the federal deposit insurance funds, as well as to minimize systemic risk, and not for the protection of our shareholders or other creditors. Following the financial crisis of 2008, new laws and regulations were promulgated, and supervisory efforts to apply laws, regulations and policies have become more intense through increased examination scrutiny, heightened regulatory expectations regarding compliance and enforcement actions.  

American Express Company and TRS are bank holding companies, and have elected to be treated as financial holding companies, under the BHC Act. As bank holding companies under the BHC Act, American Express Company and TRS are subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve. Under the system of functional regulation established under the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve supervises the Company, including all its non-bank subsidiaries, as an umbrella regulator of the consolidated organization and generally defers to the primary U.S. regulators of the Companys U.S. depository institution subsidiaries with respect to the supervision and regulation of those institutions. Banking regulators have broad examination and enforcement power over bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, including the power to impose substantial fines, limit dividends and other capital distributions, restrict operations and acquisitions and require divestitures. Bank holding companies and banks, as well as subsidiaries of both, are prohibited by law from engaging in practices that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound. The Company and its subsidiaries, including Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, also are subject to supervision, examination and enforcement by the CFPB with respect to marketing and sale of consumer financial products and compliance with certain federal consumer financial laws, including, among other laws, the CFPA and the TILA. See Card-Issuing Business and Deposit Programs  Regulation within U.S. Card Services above for additional information about the regulation and review of consumer financial products and services.  

Many aspects of our business also are subject to rigorous regulation by other U.S. federal and state regulatory agencies and securities exchanges and by non-U.S. government agencies or regulatory bodies and securities exchanges. Certain of our public disclosure, internal control environment and corporate governance principles are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) and related regulations and rules of the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. As a global financial institution, to the extent that different regulatory systems impose overlapping or inconsistent requirements on the conduct of our business, we face complexity and additional costs in our compliance efforts. New laws or regulations or changes to existing laws and regulations (including changes in interpretation or enforcement), as well as the enforcement of both existing and new laws and regulations, could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition to the discussion in this section, see Risk FactorsLegal and Regulatory Risks below for a further discussion of the potential impact legislative and regulatory changes may have on our results of operations and financial condition.

Table of Contents 

Financial Holding Company Status and Activities  

The BHC Act limits the non-banking activities of bank holding companies. The activities of bank holding companies that have not elected to be treated as financial holding companies are restricted to those activities that the Federal Reserve has determined are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. An eligible bank holding company may elect to be treated as a financial holding company, which is authorized to engage in a broader range of financial activities. A financial holding company may engage in any activity that has been determined by rule or order to be financial in nature, incidental to such financial activity, or (with prior Federal Reserve approval) complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of a depository institution or to the financial system generally. As a financial holding company, American Express engages in various activities permissible only for a bank holding company that has elected to be treated as a financial holding company including, in particular, providing travel agency services, acting as a finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency services.  

For a bank holding company to become and remain eligible for financial holding company status, the bank holding company and each of its subsidiary U.S. depository institutions must be well capitalized and well managed, and each of its subsidiary U.S. depository institutions must have received at least a satisfactory rating on its most recent assessment under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the CRA). If the bank holding company fails to meet applicable standards for financial holding company status (which, in most cases, is confidential supervisory information), it is likely to be barred from engaging in new types of financial activities or making certain types of acquisitions or investments in reliance on its status as a financial holding company, and ultimately could be required to either discontinue the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies or divest its subsidiary U.S. depository institutions.  

Dodd-Frank prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The statutory provision is commonly called the Volcker Rule. In December 2013, federal regulators adopted final rules to implement the Volcker Rule. The final rules are highly complex, and many aspects of their application remain uncertain. The final rules also require that large bank holding companies, such as the Company, design and implement compliance programs to ensure adherence to the Volcker Rules prohibitions. We are continuing to evaluate the effects of the final rules, but we do not currently anticipate that the Volcker Rule will have a material effect on our operations. Development and monitoring of the required compliance program, however, may require the expenditure of significant resources and management attention.  

See Our business is subject to significant and extensive government regulation and supervision, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in Risk Factors below.   

Heightened Prudential Requirements for Large Bank Holding Companies  

Dodd-Frank imposes heightened prudential requirements on bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, including the Company, and requires the Federal Reserve to establish prudential standards for such large bank holding companies that are more stringent than those applicable to other bank holding companies, including standards for risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity, risk management requirements, resolution plans (referred to as living wills), stress tests, early remediation, credit exposure reporting and concentration. The Federal Reserve has discretionary authority to establish additional prudential standards on its own, or at the recommendation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits and otherwise as it deems appropriate. Because the Federal Reserve may, on its own volition or in response to a recommendation by the FSOC, tailor the application of these enhanced prudential standards to specific companies, including the Company, the ultimate impact of these enhanced standards on the Company is not certain and may change in the future depending on the application of these standards to us and other participants in the financial services industry.  

37  

Table of Contents 

The Federal Reserve has issued several proposed and final rules under its authority to establish such enhanced prudential standards for large bank holding companies, including the stress testing and capital adequacy rules discussed below. In addition, on February 18, 2014, the Federal Reserve approved a final rule implementing several heightened prudential requirements, including the following:  

       Enhanced Liquidity Management Standards: The Federal Reserves rule focuses on prudential steps to manage liquidity risk, which comprehensively detail liquidity risk management responsibilities for boards of directors and senior management, and require, among other things, maintenance of a liquidity buffer, consisting of assets meeting certain standards, that is sufficient to meet projected net cash outflows and projected loss or impairment of existing funding sources for 30 days over a range of liquidity stress scenarios. To complement these liquidity standards, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule in October 2013 to implement the liquidity framework derived from the international liquidity standards incorporated into the Basel III framework. See Capital Adequacy  Liquidity Ratios under Basel III below.  

       Enhanced Risk Management Requirements: Bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets, and publicly traded bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in consolidated assets, are required to establish a dedicated risk committee reporting directly to the companys board of directors, comprised of members of the bank holding companys board of directors, which would review and approve the enterprise-wide risk management policies of the company. The risk committee is required to have an appropriate number of independent directors, at least one risk management expert and oversight of the operation of an enterprise-wide risk management framework commensurate with the companys capital structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, size and other appropriate risk-related factors, and is subject to certain governance provisions set forth in the rule. Such bank holding companies, including the Company, are also required to appoint a Chief Risk Officer. We have already established such a risk committee and appointed a Chief Risk Officer.  

While the final rule adopted by the Federal Reserve largely implements the December 2011 proposals regarding liquidity and risk management, the final rule does not address the Federal Reserves proposals regarding single counterparty credit exposure or early remediation requirements. We are continuing to review the final rule and assess its impact on our operations. Under the terms of the final rule, we are generally required to fully comply with liquidity management and risk management requirements as of January 1, 2015.  

Stress Testing  

As part of its implementation of the enhanced prudential requirements of Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve issued rules relating to supervisory and company-run analyses of certain large bank holding companies to evaluate whether the companies have sufficient capital on a total consolidated basis necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions (so-called stress tests). The Federal Reserve applies its stress tests rules and its capital planning requirements, discussed in Capital Planning below, on a consolidated basis:  

       Supervisory Stress Testing: The Federal Reserve must conduct annual stress tests of bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company. Under this rule, the stress tests use a minimum of three economic and financial scenarios generated by the Federal Reserve (baseline, adverse and severely adverse), and are based on methodologies and data that the Federal Reserve makes available to companies no later than November 15 of each year. A summary of results of individual stress tests will be made public by the Federal Reserve on a company-specific basis.  

       Company Stress Testing: Bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company, are also required to conduct a similar stress test on a semiannual basis. A summary of the results of each of these tests must be publicly disclosed.  

The FDIC and the OCC have also issued rules consistent with the Federal Reserves regulations governing company-conducted stress testing to implement annual company stress testing requirements applicable to certain banking organizations, including Centurion Bank and AEBFSB. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB will be required to report the results of their stress tests in 2015.

Capital Planning  

Bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including the Company, are required to develop and maintain a so-called capital plan, and to submit the capital plan to the Federal Reserve for review under its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process. The capital plan must cover a planning horizon of at least nine quarters (beginning with the quarter preceding the submission of the plan) and include the following components:  

       an assessment of the bank holding companys expected uses and sources of capital over the planning horizon that accounts for the bank holding companys size, complexity, risk profile and scope of operations, and under expected and stressful conditions according to scenarios developed by the bank holding company and the Federal Reserve;  

       a detailed description of the bank holding companys process for assessing capital adequacy, including how it will, under expected and stressful conditions, maintain capital commensurate with its risks, above the minimum regulatory ratios, and to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary depository institutions, and sufficient to continue operations by maintaining steady access to funding, meeting obligations to creditors and other counterparties and continuing to serve as a credit intermediary;  

       the bank holding companys capital policy; and  

       a discussion of any expected changes to the bank holding companys business.  

Each capital plan must consider a minimum of four planning scenarios, including separate baseline and stressed scenarios developed by the bank holding company and the Federal Reserve. The severely adverse stress scenario developed by the Federal Reserve for the 2014 process is designed to represent an outcome that, in the opinion of the Federal Reserve, is unlikely, but could occur if the U.S. economy were to experience a deep recession while at the same time economic activity in other major economies were also to contract significantly. In addition to other limitations, our ability to make any capital distributions (including dividends and share repurchases) is contingent on the Federal Reserves approval or non-objection to our capital plan under both quantitative and qualitative tests. Likewise, the Federal Reserve may limit our ability to take any capital actions should the Company fail to include any intended action in its capital plan.  

A bank holding companys board of directors, or a designated committee thereof, is required, at least annually, to review the robustness of the bank holding companys process for assessing capital adequacy, ensure that any deficiencies are remedied and approve the capital plan.  

In its review of the capital plan, the Federal Reserve will consider the plans comprehensiveness, the reasonableness of its assumptions and analysis, and the bank holding companys methodologies for reviewing the robustness of the capital adequacy process and ability to maintain capital above minimum regulatory ratios under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon. In addition, the Federal Reserve will engage in a qualitative review of a bank holding companys capital planning processes and procedures. Based on its overall review and the regulatory capital requirements described below, the Federal Reserve will either object or not object to the capital plan. The Federal Reserve has broad authority to object to capital plans, and to require bank holding companies to revise and resubmit their capital plans for approval. Bank holding companies are also subject to an ongoing requirement to revise and resubmit their capital plans upon the occurrence of certain events specified by rule, or when required by the Federal Reserve. If a bank holding company receives an objection to its capital plan, it must resubmit a revised plan within 30 days. Should the Federal Reserve object to a capital plan, a bank holding company may not make any capital distribution other than those capital distributions that the Federal Reserve has indicated non-objection to in writing.  

The Federal Reserve has indicated that it intends to publish the results of its supervisory stress test for the portion of each bank holding companys capital plan that relates to the adverse and severely adverse stress scenarios developed by the Federal Reserve. The information to be released will include, among other things, the Federal Reserves projection of company-specific information, including post-stress capital ratios and the minimum value of these ratios over the planning horizon.

Table of Contents 

Similar to last year, the Federal Reserve has noted that bank holding companies will have limited ability to adjust downward planned capital actions in light of stress test results. Should any adjustment occur, the Federal Reserve intends to publicly disclose the results of stress tests using both the original and adjusted 2014 capital plans. Additionally, in September 2013, the Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule amending its capital plan and stress test rules to clarify how bank holding companies with over $50 billion in total consolidated assets should incorporate the recently adopted New Capital Rules (as defined below) for the 2014 CCAR process and the supervisory and company run stress tests. Under the Federal Reserves interim final rule such bank holding companies, including the Company, must both: (1) project its regulatory capital ratios and meet the required minimums under the New Capital Rules for each quarter of the nine-quarter planning horizon in accordance with the minimum capital requirements that are in effect during that quarter, subject to appropriate phase-ins/phase-outs under the new rules; and (2) continue to meet the minimum 5 percent Tier 1 common equity ratio as calculated under the previously generally applicable risk-based capital rules.  

On January 6, 2014, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve. We expect a response from the Federal Reserve during the first quarter of 2014.  

Dividends  

The Company and TRS, as well as Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, are limited by banking statutes, regulations and supervisory policy in their ability to pay dividends. In general, federal and applicable state banking laws prohibit, without first obtaining regulatory approval, insured depository institutions, such as Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, from making dividend distributions if such distributions are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause the institution to fail to meet capital adequacy standards. As described below under Prompt Corrective Action, the FDIA also generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. In addition to specific limitations on the dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies, federal banking regulators could prohibit a dividend that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.  

Dividend payments by the Company and TRS to shareholders are subject to the oversight of the Federal Reserve. It is Federal Reserve policy that bank holding companies generally should pay dividends on common stock only out of net income available to common shareholders generated over the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations current and expected future capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve has indicated, however, that capital plans implying dividend payout ratios above 30 percent of projected after-tax net income will receive particularly close scrutiny. Moreover, bank holding companies should not maintain dividend levels that place undue pressure on the capital of depository institution subsidiaries or that may undermine the bank holding companys ability to be a source of strength to its banking subsidiaries. The Federal Reserve could prohibit a dividend by the Company or TRS that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization.  

Because the Company is a bank holding company with more than $50 billion in consolidated assets, its payment of dividends is subject to heightened regulatory requirements. The Company is required to include projected dividend payments in the capital plan required to be submitted to the Federal Reserve, discussed above under Capital Planning, and the restrictions imposed as part of the capital planning process will likely be the principal limitation on our ability to make capital distributions (including dividends and share repurchases). In addition, the Company generally is required to obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve before it can make capital distributions, including dividend payments, under any of the following circumstances (regardless of whether the distribution is part of a capital plan to which the Federal Reserve has not objected):  

       the Company will not meet a minimum regulatory capital ratio or a Tier 1 common equity ratio of at least 5 percent after giving effect to the capital distribution;  

40  

Table of Contents 

       the Federal Reserve has notified the Company that it has determined that either (i) the capital distribution will result in a material adverse change to the Companys capital or liquidity structure, or (ii) the Companys earnings are materially underperforming projections;  

       the dollar amount of the capital distribution will exceed the projected distribution described in the Companys approved capital plan; or  

       the capital distribution will occur after the occurrence of an event requiring the resubmission (other than pursuant to an objection) of the Companys capital plan and before the Federal Reserve has acted on the resubmitted plan.  

Living Wills  

In December 2013, we filed our initial plan for the rapid and orderly resolution of the Company under the Bankruptcy Code in the event of material distress or failure. Under rules adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC pursuant to Dodd-Frank, we are required to update this plan annually and may be required to update it upon the occurrence of material changes in our business, structure or operations. This resolution planning requirement may, as a practical matter, present additional constraints on our structure, operations and business strategy, and on transactions and business arrangements between our bank and non-bank subsidiaries, because we must consider the impact of these matters on our ability to prepare and submit a resolution plan that demonstrates that we may be resolved under the Bankruptcy Code in a rapid and orderly manner. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC determine that our plan is not credible and we fail to cure the deficiencies, we may be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations, or ultimately be required to divest certain assets or operations to facilitate an orderly resolution.  

Acquisitions and Investments  

As a bank holding company with insured depository institution subsidiaries, we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit our investments and acquisitions. In addition, acquisitions and investments may be subject to the prior review and approval of our regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC. The banking agencies have broad discretion in evaluating proposed acquisitions and investments. In deciding whether to approve an acquisition, federal banking regulators may consider, among other factors, effects of the acquisition on competition, financial and managerial resources, and financial stability; future prospects, including current and projected capital ratios and levels; the competence and expertise of management and our record of compliance with laws and regulations; public benefits; the convenience and needs of the community and our depository institution subsidiaries record of compliance with the CRA; risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system; and our effectiveness in combating money laundering.  

Among other things, the BHC Act requires a bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before: (1) it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings and loan association, if after such acquisition, the bank holding company will directly or indirectly own or control more than 5 percent of any class of the voting securities of the institution; (2) it or any of its subsidiaries, other than a bank, may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings and loan association (the Bank Merger Act requires regulatory approval before a bank subsidiary may make such an acquisition); or (3) it may merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company.  

The Federal Reserve must approve certain additional capital contributions to an existing non-U.S. investment and certain direct and indirect acquisitions by the Company of an interest in a non-U.S. company, including in a foreign bank. Dodd-Frank requires bank holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than $50 billion to provide the Federal Reserve with written notice (which is largely tantamount to an approval process) prior to acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any company (other than an insured depository institution) that is engaged in financial activities described in section 4(k) of the BHC Act and that has total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more, subject to certain exceptions. Dodd-Frank  

41  

Table of Contents 

 also requires financial holding companies to obtain Federal Reserve approval prior to acquiring any non-bank company with total consolidated assets in excess of $10 billion.  

Applicable federal and state laws also limit the ability of persons to invest in or acquire control of the Company without providing notice to or obtaining the approval of one or more of our regulators. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person, entity, or group of persons or entities acting in concert, from directly or indirectly acquiring control of a bank holding company such as the Company, unless the Federal Reserve has been given prior notice and has not objected to the transaction. Under Federal Reserve regulations, the acquisition of 10 percent or more of a class of voting stock of the Company would generally create a rebuttable presumption of acquisition of control of the Company and require prior notice to and non-objection by the Federal Reserve. Additionally, under the BHC Act, any person or company is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before acquiring control of the Company, which, among other things, includes the acquisition of ownership of or control over 25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the Company or the power to exercise a controlling influence over the Company. In the case of an acquirer that is a bank or bank holding company, the BHC Act requires approval of the Federal Reserve for the acquisition of ownership or control of any voting securities of the Company, if the acquisition results in the bank or bank holding company controlling more than 5 percent of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company.  

Source of Strength  

Bank holding companies are required by statute to act as a source of strength to all of their insured depository institution subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company is required to act as a source of strength to Centurion Bank and AEBFSB and may be required to commit capital and financial resources to support both institutions. Such support may be required at times when, absent this requirement, the Company otherwise might determine not to provide it.  

Capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.  

Capital Adequacy  

The Company, TRS, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy rules established by federal banking regulators. These rules are intended to ensure that bank holding companies and banks (collectively, banking organizations) have adequate capital given the level of assets and off-balance sheet obligations, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets.  

Since the late 1980s, the federal banking regulators capital adequacy rules have been based on accords agreed to by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee). These frameworks include general risk-based capital rules applicable to all banking organizations based on the 1988 Capital Accord, known as Basel I, and risk-based capital rules applicable to banking organizations having $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in foreign exposures, known as advanced approaches institutions, based on the advanced internal ratings-based approach for credit risk and the advanced measurement approach for operational risk in the Revised Framework for the International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards issued by the Basel Committee in June 2006, known as Basel II.  

In July 2013, federal banking regulators adopted rules (the New Capital Rules) substantially revising the general risk-based capital rules previously applicable to banking organizations to make them more risk sensitive and implementing the final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, known as Basel III, released by the Basel Committee in December 2010. The New Capital Rules are currently being phased-in and, subject to transition provisions for certain adjustments to the components of capital, will begin to  

42  

Table of Contents 

 take effect for all banking organizations as of January 1, 2015. As an advanced approaches institution, the Company and, consequently, each of TRS, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are required to comply with portions of the New Capital Rules beginning in 2014, specifically the revised capital definitions and minimum capital ratio requirements, while still using Basel I risk-weighted assets.  

For additional information regarding our capital ratios, see Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity on pages 35-37 of our 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  

New Capital Rules. Under the New Capital Rules, new minimum capital and buffer requirements were established and will be fully phased-in by 2019. Specifically, banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and Total capital to risk-weighted assets. In addition, all banking organizations remain subject to a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to average balance sheet assets. Advanced approaches institutions will also become subject to a supplementary leverage ratio. For purposes of calculating these ratios, a banking organizations capital is classified into the following categories:  

       Common Equity Tier 1 Capital. CET1 includes common equity, retained earnings and a limited amount of minority interests in CET1 of consolidated subsidiaries.  

       Additional Tier 1 Capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a limited amount of minority interests in Additional Tier 1 capital instruments of consolidated subsidiaries, in each case subject to specific requirements of the New Capital Rules.  

       Tier 2 Capital. Tier 2 capital includes certain subordinated debt, preferred stock that is cumulative or has a mandatory redemption date and a limited amount of minority interests in Tier 2 capital of consolidated subsidiaries, in each case subject to specific requirements of the New Capital Rules.  

The inclusion in a bank holding companys Additional Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital of trust preferred securities and the inclusion in a bank holding companys Tier 1 capital of cumulative perpetual preferred stock, in each case issued prior to May 19, 2010 (and both included in a bank holding companys Tier 1 capital under the risk-based capital rules as in effect prior to January 1, 2015), will be completely phased-out on January 1, 2015. Additionally, the New Capital Rules also require the deduction of certain assets from CET1 (deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income, mortgage servicing rights, investments in financial firms and pension assets, among others, within prescribed limitations) and the inclusion of accumulated OCI in capital. Goodwill and most intangible assets will also be subject to a full deduction from CET1.  

A banking organizations assets and some of its specified off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are also assigned to various risk categories for purposes of calculating the required risk-based ratios. The New Capital Rules amend and replace the current risk-weighting categories used to calculate risk-weighted assets in the denominator of capital ratios with a broader array of risk weighting categories that are intended to be more risk sensitive based on the standardized approach proposed by Basel II. The new risk-weights for the standardized approach range from 0 percent to 600 percent compared with the risk-weights of 0 percent to 100 percent, in general, in the regulators existing general risk-based capital guidelines. Higher risk-weights would apply to a variety of exposures, including certain securitization exposures, equity exposures, claims on securities firms and exposures to counterparties on OTC derivatives. In addition, advanced approaches banking organizations will calculate risk-based capital ratios under both the generally applicable standardized approach and the advanced approaches rule, and then use the lower of each capital ratio to determine whether it meets its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The portions of the New Capital Rules implementing the standardized approach become effective January 1, 2015.  

During 2014, we will begin reporting our capital adequacy standards on a parallel basis to federal banking regulators using both risk-weighted assets calculated under the current Basel I-based capital framework, as adjusted for certain items, and the requirements for an advanced approaches institution. The parallel period will  

43  

Table of Contents 

 continue until we receive regulatory approval to exit parallel reporting, at which point we will begin publicly reporting capital ratios using risk-weighted assets calculated under the higher of the advanced approaches and the standardized approaches in the New Capital Rules.  

During the 2014 calendar year, while the New Capital Rules are being phased-in, the Company, TRS, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB must each maintain CET1, Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) ratios of at least 4.0 percent, 5.5 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively. As of January 1, 2015, however, all applicable banking organizations must maintain CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios of at least 4.5 percent, 6.0 percent and 8.0 percent, respectively, without giving effect to the capital conservation buffer, countercyclical capital buffer or deductions from regulatory capital discussed below.  

The New Capital Rules also implement a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. As a result, the minimum ratios are effectively 7.0 percent, 8.5 percent and 10.5 percent for the CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, respectively, on a fully phased-in basis. Implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625 percent level and will increase in equal increments at the beginning of each year until it is fully implemented on January 1, 2019. Additionally, the required minimum CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios for advanced approaches institutions such as the Company may be further increased by a countercyclical capital buffer composed entirely of CET1 up to 2.5 percent, which may be assessed when federal banking regulators determine that such a buffer is necessary to protect the banking system from disorderly downturns associated with excessively expansionary periods. When fully phased-in, the countercyclical capital buffer and capital conservation buffer could potentially result in up to an additional 5.0 percent being added to each of the ratios of CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital to risk-weighted assets.  

Banking institutions whose ratio of CET1, Tier 1 Capital or Total capital to risk-weighted assets is above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on discretionary distributions such as dividends, repurchases and redemptions of capital securities, and executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.  

As a supervisory matter, federal banking regulators expect most bank holding companies, and in particular larger bank holding companies such as the Company, to maintain regulatory capital ratios that, at a minimum, qualify a bank holding company and its depository institution subsidiaries as well capitalized. The rules also provide that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets. Following the recent financial crisis, federal banking regulators have encouraged larger bank holding companies to maintain capital ratios appreciably above the well capitalized standard. Moreover, the Federal Reserve is focusing more on the regulatory requirement that common equity be the predominant element of Tier 1 capital. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has indicated that it will consider a tangible Tier 1 capital leverage ratio (deducting all intangibles) and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activities.  

In November 2011, the Basel Committee supplemented Basel III by issuing final provisions applying a new CET1 surcharge to certain global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). In a companion release addressing progress on a variety of financial regulatory reforms relating to global systemically important financial institutions, the Financial Stability Board released a list of 29 such institutions and indicated that it used the G-SIB surcharge methodology in creating the list. The Company was not included on either the original or revised lists of G-SIBs released in November 2012 and November 2013.  

In October 2012, the Basel Committee issued final rules intended to supplement the G-SIB framework by imposing a CET1 surcharge on certain banks that may not be significant from an international perspective, but  

44  

Table of Contents 

 nevertheless have an important impact on their domestic economies (D-SIBs). The framework establishes a minimum set of principles against which the federal banking regulators would evaluate whether a bank is a D-SIB and determine the amount of capital that a D-SIB is required to hold and/or whether the D-SIB should be subject to other policy tools. However, the New Capital Rules do not indicate whether any, or to what extent, banking organizations that are not designated as G-SIBs may be subject to a D-SIB surcharge. In line with the Basel Committees stated objective that the D-SIB framework complement the G-SIB framework, the D-SIB surcharge will be implemented together with the G-SIB surcharge beginning in January 2016. While the New Capital Rules did not address the adoption of the surcharge on G-SIBs or D-SIBs, federal banking regulators noted that they are considering a capital surcharge for institutions with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, or some subset of such institutions, consistent with the Basel Committees surcharge proposals.  

Leverage Requirements. Banking organizations are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements. The leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organizations Tier 1 capital to its total adjusted quarterly average assets (as defined for regulatory purposes). The existing rules require a minimum leverage ratio of 3.0 percent for banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria, including having the highest regulatory rating. All other banking organizations are generally required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent. The New Capital Rules eliminate the 3.0 percent minimum leverage ratio for highly-rated banking organizations, with the consequence that all banking organizations will be required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4.0 percent as of January 1, 2015. The elimination of the 3.0 percent minimum leverage ratio with respect to advanced approaches institutions became effective on January 1, 2014.  

The New Capital Rules also establish a supplementary leverage ratio requirement for advanced approaches banking organizations such as the Company, consistent with the Basel III framework. The supplementary leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to an expanded concept of leverage exposure that includes both on-balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet exposures. The New Capital Rules require a minimum supplemental leverage ratio of 3.0 percent for advanced approaches banking organizations, with reporting to the federal banking regulators commencing January 1, 2015 and full implementation and compliance by January 1, 2018.  

The Basel Committee and the federal banking regulators are each independently considering potential changes to the supplementary leverage ratio that, individually or taken together, could make it substantially more restrictive. In particular, the Basel Committee has proposed revisions to the supplementary leverage ratios denominator, including modifications regarding the treatment of securities financing transactions and certain derivatives. Separately, the federal banking regulators have proposed revisions to the supplementary leverage ratio that would increase the supplementary leverage requirement for certain holding companies to exceed 5 percent. In addition, this proposal would establish a supplemental leverage ratio well capitalized threshold of 6 percent for certain insured depository institutions under the prompt corrective action framework.  

Liquidity Ratios under Basel III. Historically, regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, both in the United States and internationally, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward will be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR), is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted into cash to meet its liquidity needs for a 30-day time horizon under a significantly severe liquidity stress scenario specified by supervisors. The ratio of a firms liquid assets to its projected net outflows is its LCR. In October 2013, federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule implementing the LCR requirement for advanced approaches banking organizations, such as the Company, and their depository institution subsidiaries with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets, such as AEBSFB and Centurion Bank. Under the federal banking regulators LCR proposal, covered banking organizations would be required to comply with the LCR on an accelerated schedule, maintaining a minimum of 80 percent of the required LCR by January 1, 2015, 90 percent by January 1, 2016 and 100 percent by January 1, 2017. The comment period on the federal banking regulators LCR proposal ended on January 31, 2014.  

45  

Table of Contents 

The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio (NSFR), is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements will incent banking entities to increase their holdings of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source. Federal banking regulators have not yet proposed rules implementing the NSFR liquidity framework for U.S. banking institutions. The Basel III liquidity framework contemplates that the NSFR will be implemented as a minimum standard by January 1, 2018.  

The Federal Reserves proposed heightened prudential requirements for bank holding companies with $50 billion or more of consolidated total assets also include enhanced liquidity standards, as discussed above under Heightened Prudential Requirements for Large Bank Holding Companies.  

Prompt Corrective Action  

The FDIA requires, among other things, that federal banking regulators take prompt corrective action in respect of FDIC-insured depository institutions (such as Centurion Bank and AEBFSB) that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA specifies five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. A depository institutions capital tier depends upon how its capital levels compare to various relevant capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation. A bank may be deemed to be in a capitalization category that is lower than is indicated by its actual capital position if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating. Once an institution becomes undercapitalized, the FDIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified. A depository institution that is not well capitalized is also subject to restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits including Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service deposits. A significant amount of the Companys outstanding U.S. retail deposits has been raised through third-party channels, and such deposits are considered brokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes. For a description of our deposit programs, see Deposit Programs under U.S. Card Services  Consumer and Small Business Services above and Deposit Programs on page 39 of our 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  

The FDIA generally prohibits an FDIC-insured depository institution from making any capital distribution (including payment of dividends) or paying any management fee to its holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to restrictions on borrowing from the Federal Reserve and to growth limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. For a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, any holding company must guarantee the capital plan up to an amount equal to the lesser of 5 percent of the depository institutions assets at the time it became undercapitalized and the amount of the capital deficiency at the time it fails to comply with the plan. In the event of the holding companys bankruptcy, such guarantee would take priority over claims of its general unsecured creditors. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized.  

Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.  

Early Remediation Regime  

Dodd-Frank requires the establishment of an early remediation regime for bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets, including the Company. In January 2012, the Federal Reserve published a notice of proposed rulemaking that included a proposed early remediation system based in part on  

46  

Table of Contents 

 the prompt corrective action regime that currently applies to insured depository institutions under the FDIA. The proposed rule, however, utilizes forward-looking triggers based on capital and leverage, stress test requirements, risk management, liquidity and publicly available market data. Because these rules are not yet final, their ultimate impact on us is not certain.  

Transactions Between Centurion Bank or AEBFSB and Their Respective Affiliates  

Certain transactions (including loans and credit extensions from Centurion Bank and AEBFSB) between Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, on the one hand, and their affiliates (including the Company, TRS and their non-bank subsidiaries), on the other hand, are subject to quantitative and qualitative limitations, collateral requirements, and other restrictions imposed by statute and Federal Reserve regulation. Transactions subject to these restrictions are generally required to be made on an arms-length basis. These restrictions generally do not apply to transactions between a depository institution and its subsidiaries.  

FDIC Insurance Assessments  

Centurion Bank and AEBFSB accept deposits and those deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the applicable limits. The FDICs deposit insurance fund (Deposit Insurance Fund) is funded by assessments on insured depository institutions.  

Each institutions assessments are based on the average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the insured depository institution during the assessment period (the assessment base). The assessment rate applicable to large depository institutions, such as Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, is adjusted based upon the insured depository institutions ratio of (1) long-term unsecured debt to the assessment base, (2) long-term unsecured debt issued by another insured depository institution to the assessment base and (3) brokered deposits to the assessment base. The adjustments for brokered deposits to the assessment base do not apply so long as the institution is well capitalized and has a composite CAMELS rating of 1 or 2. The rules permit the FDIC to impose additional discretionary assessment rate adjustments.  

Dodd-Frank requires the FDIC to maintain a minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund of 1.35 percent of estimated insured deposits by September 30, 2020. On December 20, 2010, the FDIC issued a final rule setting the increased reserve ratio at 2 percent. This rule represents an increase in the reserve ratio and will result in increased costs for Centurion Bank and AEBFSB. In addition, Dodd-Frank eliminated the ceiling (1.5 percent of insured deposits) on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund and made the payment of dividends from the Deposit Insurance Fund by the FDIC discretionary.  

Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate the insurance of an institutions deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance at either of our insured depository institution subsidiaries.  

FDIC Powers upon Insolvency of Insured Depository Institutions  

If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an insured depository institution, such as Centurion Bank or AEBFSB, upon its insolvency or in certain other events, the FDIC has the power: (1) to transfer any of the depository institutions assets and liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the depository institutions creditors; (2) to enforce the terms of the depository institutions contracts pursuant to their terms; or (3) to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution.

In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC against an insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution, including claims of debt holders of the institution and depositors in non-U.S. offices, in the liquidation or other resolution of the institution by a receiver. As a result, whether or not the FDIC ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of Centurion Bank or AEBFSB, the debt holders and depositors in non-U.S. offices would be treated differently from, and could receive substantially less, if anything, than the depositors in U.S. offices of the depository institution.  

Orderly Liquidation Authority under Dodd-Frank  

Dodd-Frank created the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), a resolution regime for systemically important non-bank financial companies, including bank holding companies, under which the Treasury Secretary may appoint the FDIC as receiver to liquidate such a company if the company is in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. This determination by the Treasury Secretary must come after supermajority recommendations by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC and consultation by the Treasury Secretary with the President of the United States, and after certain other conditions are met. OLA is similar to the FDIC resolution model for depository institutions, including granting very broad powers to the FDIC as receiver. Though creditors rights under OLA were modified from the FDIC regime to reduce disparities in treatment between OLA and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, substantial differences exist between the two regimes, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in limited circumstances, the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditor claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure used in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of the FDIC to transfer claims to a bridge entity.  

Dodd-Frank also established an Orderly Liquidation Fund that may provide liquidity to the receivership or a related bridge entity in an OLA liquidation proceeding. The Orderly Liquidation Fund would be funded through borrowings from the U.S. Department of Treasury and repaid from the assets of the failed financial company and, if necessary, risk-based assessments made, first, on entities that received more in the OLA proceeding than they would have received in a Chapter 7 liquidation to the extent of such excess and, second, on bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as the Company, and on certain other non-bank financial companies. If an orderly liquidation is triggered, the Company could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund. It is not possible to determine the level of any such future assessments.  

The FDIC has developed a strategy under OLA, referred to as the single point of entry or SPOE strategy, under which the FDIC would resolve a failed financial holding company by transferring its assets (including shares of its operating subsidiaries) and, potentially, very limited liabilities to a bridge holding company; utilize the resources of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries; and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed financial holding company and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company. Under this strategy, management of the failed financial holding company would be replaced and shareholders and creditors of the failed financial holding company would bear the losses resulting from the failure. The FDIC issued a notice in December 2013 describing some elements of the SPOE strategy, and seeking public comment to further develop the strategy.  

Cross-Guarantee Provisions  

Under the cross-guarantee provision of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), insured depository institutions, such as Centurion Bank and AEBFSB, may be liable to the FDIC with respect to any loss incurred or reasonably anticipated to be incurred by the FDIC in connection with the default of, or FDIC assistance to, any commonly controlled insured depository institution. Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are commonly controlled within the meaning of the FIRREA cross-guarantee provision.

Community Reinvestment Act  

Centurion Bank and AEBFSB are subject to the CRA, which imposes affirmative, ongoing obligations on depository institutions to meet the credit needs of their local communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the institution. The CRA requires an institutions primary federal regulator, as part of the examination process, to assess the institutions record in meeting its obligations under the CRA, and also to take such assessment into account in evaluating merger and acquisition proposals and applications to open or relocate a branch office. AEBFSB was examined by the OCC for CRA compliance during the third quarter of 2012 and received a satisfactory CRA rating. Centurion Bank was examined by the FDIC during the fourth quarter of 2013 and is awaiting the results of this examination. In its last examination, Centurion Bank received a satisfactory CRA rating.  

In the case of a bank holding company, such as the Company and TRS, applying for approval to acquire a bank or bank holding company, the Federal Reserve will assess the record of each subsidiary depository institution of the applicant bank holding company in considering the application. In addition, as discussed previously, the failure of the Companys U.S. banking subsidiaries to maintain satisfactory CRA ratings could result in restrictions on the Companys and TRS ability to engage in activities in reliance on financial holding company authority.  

Privacy and Data Protection  

We have established and continue to maintain policies that provide the framework for compliance with applicable Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws, meet evolving customer privacy expectations and support and enable business innovation and growth.  

We use information about our customers to develop and make available relevant, personalized products and services. Customers are given choices about how we use and disclose their information, and we give them notice regarding the measures we take to safeguard this information in accordance with applicable Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws.  

Regulatory and legislative activity, as well as media and public focus, in the areas of privacy, data protection and information security continues to increase worldwide, spurred by advancements in technology (including mobile devices), broad use of the internet, expanding uses of mobile commerce and social networking, related concerns about the rapid and widespread collection, dissemination and use of personal information, and highly publicized security breaches and cybersecurity incidents. Our regulators, including regulatory examiners, are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy, data protection and information security-related policies and practices, including those related to access controls, are adequate to inform consumers of our data collection, use, sharing and/or security practices, to provide them with choices, if required, about how we use and share their information, and to safeguard their personal information in accordance with applicable Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws.  

In the United States, certain of our businesses may be subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and its implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, the GLBA imposes certain limitations on the ability of a financial institution to share consumers nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties; requires that a financial institution provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to opt out of the institutions disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties (with limited exceptions), and requires the financial institution to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institutions size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institutions activities and the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution. The GLBA does not preempt state laws that afford greater privacy protections to consumers. Various states also have adopted laws, rules and/or regulations pertaining to privacy and/or information security, including certain potentially applicable financial privacy laws (such as a law in effect in California); data security and/or data  

49  

Table of Contents 

 disposal requirements (including potentially applicable requirements adopted in states such as Massachusetts and Nevada); online privacy laws (such as a law in effect in California); and laws relating to the confidentiality of certain types of data (such as laws governing certain health-related information and/or Social Security numbers, for which there are also potentially applicable federal laws, rules, regulations and/or guidance as well). Certain of these requirements may apply to the personal information of our employees and/or contractors as well as our customers.  

Various U.S. federal banking regulators, and 46 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, have enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulator and/or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a data security breach. Data breach notification laws are also becoming more prevalent in other parts of the world where we operate, including Germany, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Taiwan. In many countries that have yet to impose data breach notification requirements, regulators have increasingly used the threat of significant sanctions and penalties by data protection authorities to encourage voluntary breach notification.  

We are also subject to certain Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws in other countries in which we operate (including countries in the European Union, Australia, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong, Mexico and Singapore), some of which are more stringent than those in the United States.  

In Europe, European Directive 95/46/EC (commonly referred to as the Data Protection Directive), which has been in place since 1995, provides for the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. The Data Protection Directive requires the controller and/or processor of an individuals personal data to, among other things, take the necessary technical and organizational steps to protect personal data. More recently, Directive 2009/136/EC (commonly referred to as the e-Privacy Directive or Cookies Directive) introduced new requirements on the collection and use of data about internet users and required Member States to enact national laws to comply with such requirements. Compliance with data protection laws in Europe and elsewhere could result in higher technology, administrative and other costs for the Company and limit our ability to optimize the use of our closed-loop data.  

The European Commission released on January 25, 2012 the text of its draft proposed data protection framework regulation to replace the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC). The EU legislation process is still ongoing, however if enacted, the new regulation will affect parties, such as the Company, that collect and/or process the personal data of residents of Member States and may result in additional compliance requirements and costs. The draft General Data Protection Regulation proposes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches, in certain circumstances, to data subjects and supervisory authorities, applying uniformly across sectors and across the European Union and proposes significant fines for non-compliance with the proposed regulations requirements.  

In November 2012, we received approval from the data protection authority in the United Kingdom of our binding corporate rules (BCR) for transferring personal data collected in European Economic Area countries to American Express group companies worldwide. This approval became effective January 28, 2013. Following a consultation process between the U.K. authority and the data protection authorities in other countries in Europe, we have also received the formal approval for our BCR in the following countries: Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Sweden and The Netherlands.  

We continue our efforts to safeguard the personal information entrusted to us in accordance with applicable Privacy, Data Protection and Information Security Laws, and our internal privacy, data protection and information security-related policies, including taking steps to reduce the potential for identity theft or other fraud, while seeking to collect and use personal information in an appropriate manner to achieve our business objectives. We also have undertaken measures to assess the level of access to customer and employee data by our employees, partners and service providers.

Fair Credit Reporting  

The FCRA regulates the disclosure of consumer credit reports by consumer reporting agencies and the use of consumer credit report information by banks and other companies. Among other things, FCRA places restrictions (with limited exceptions) on the sharing and use of certain personal financial and creditworthiness information of our customers with and by our affiliates.  

The FCRA was significantly amended by the enactment in December 2003 of the FACT Act. The FACT Act requires any company that receives information concerning a consumer from an affiliate, subject to certain exceptions, to permit the consumer to opt out from having that information used to market the companys products to the consumer. In November 2007, federal banking regulators issued a final rule implementing the affiliate marketing provisions of the FACT Act. Companies subject to oversight by these agencies were required to comply with the rule by October 1, 2008. We have implemented various mechanisms to allow our customers to opt out of affiliate sharing and of marketing by the Company and our affiliates, and we continue to review and enhance these mechanisms to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and a favorable customer experience.  

The FACT Act further amended the FCRA by adding several new provisions designed to prevent or decrease identity theft and to improve the accuracy of consumer credit information. Federal banking regulators and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published a final rule in November 2007 requiring financial institutions to implement a program containing reasonable policies and procedures to address the risk of identity theft and to identify accounts where identity theft is more likely to occur. Companies subject to oversight by federal banking regulators originally were required to comply with the rule by November 1, 2008, but the FTC suspended enforcement of its rule through December 31, 2010 pending consideration of legislation by Congress to clarify the scope of entities covered by the law and the implementing regulations. On December 18, 2010, the President signed into law the Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010. Our internal policies and standards, as well as our enterprise-wide data protection, information security and fraud prevention programs, are designed to comply with the new identity theft requirements.  

The FACT Act also imposes duties on both consumer reporting agencies and on businesses that furnish or use information contained in consumer credit reports. For example, a furnisher of information is required to implement procedures to prevent the reporting of any information that it learns is the result of identity theft. Also, if a consumer disputes the accuracy of information provided to a consumer reporting agency, the furnisher of that information must conduct an investigation and respond to the consumer in a timely fashion. Federal banking regulators and the FTC have issued rules that specify the circumstances under which furnishers of information would be required to investigate disputes regarding the accuracy of the information provided to a consumer reporting agency. The FACT Act also requires grantors of credit that use consumer credit report information in making a determination to offer a borrower credit on terms that are materially less favorable than the terms offered to most of the lenders other customers to notify the borrower that the terms are based on a consumer credit report. In such a case the borrower is entitled to receive a free copy of the report from the consumer reporting agency. Federal banking regulators and the FTC have issued rules that specify the circumstances under which risk-based pricing notices must be provided to customers and the content, format and timing of such notices. Since July 21, 2011, Dodd-Frank requires the addition of certain information about credit scores to risk-based pricing notices and to adverse action notices otherwise required by the FCRA. Grantors of credit using prescreened consumer credit report information in credit solicitations are also required to include an enhanced notice to consumers that they have the right to opt out from receiving further prescreened offers of credit. The enactment of the FACT Act and the promulgation of rules implementing it are not expected to have a significant impact on our business or practices.  

The CARD Act  

We are subject to the provisions of the legislation known as the CARD Act, which was enacted in May 2009. The CARD Act and the regulations implementing the CARD Act regulate credit card billing, pricing, disclosure and other practices, as well as certain aspects of gift certificates, store gift cards and general-use prepaid cards primarily for personal use.  

51  

Table of Contents 

With respect to billing and payment, the CARD Act prohibits a card issuer from treating any payment as late for any purpose, including imposing a penalty interest rate or late fee, unless the issuer has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that a periodic statement showing the required minimum payment is mailed to the consumer at least 21 days before the payment due date. Issuers are required to apply payment amounts in excess of the required minimum payment first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (APR) and then to each successive balance bearing the next highest APR.  

With respect to pricing, the CARD Act prohibits an issuer from increasing any APR on an outstanding balance, except in specific enumerated circumstances, such as when a promotional rate expires, a variable rate adjusts, or an account is 60 or more days delinquent. An issuer also generally may not increase an APR applicable to future uses of a credit card, or an annual fee, within the first year after account opening, and then, in each case, only with advance notice. If an issuer increases an APR, the CARD Act requires that the issuer periodically reevaluate the APR increase to determine if a decrease is appropriate.  

With respect to disclosure, the CARD Act generally requires issuers to provide certain repayment disclosures on periodic statements, such as a disclosure of the total cost to the consumer, including interest charges, of paying off a balance by making only the required minimum payment each billing cycle. An issuer is also obligated to provide 45 days advance notice prior to making significant changes to the terms of an account (such as increasing an APR or a late fee) and, in some cases, gives the consumer the right to reject the proposed change.  

Other significant CARD Act provisions include requirements that the amount of each penalty fee for a violation with respect to the account be reasonable and proportional to such violation; that issuers must not open a credit card account or increase a credit line without considering the consumers ability to make the required minimum payments under the terms of the account; and that issuers must periodically provide card account agreements to the CFPB for posting on its public website.  

With respect to gift certificates, store gift cards and general-use prepaid cards primarily for personal use, the CARD Act permits the imposition of dormancy, inactivity and service fees only after one year of inactivity. Additionally, the rules prohibit the sale or issuance of a gift certificate, store gift card and general-use prepaid card that has funds with an expiration date of less than, with respect to a gift certificate, five years after the date the certificate was issued and, with respect to a store gift card or general-use prepaid card, five years after the date on which funds were last loaded. The rules also require implementation of policies and procedures intended to give consumers a reasonable opportunity to purchase a certificate or card with at least five years before the applicable expiration date. The rules prohibit fees for replacing an expired certificate or card or refunding the remaining balance if the underlying funds remain valid (except for lost or stolen cards). The CARD Act also requires certain disclosures regarding any fee other than a dormancy, inactivity or service fee.  

Anti-Money Laundering Compliance  

American Express is subject to a significant number of AML laws and regulations as a result of being a financial company headquartered in the United States, as well as having a global presence. In the United States, the majority of AML requirements is derived from the Bank Secrecy Act, as it has been amended by the Patriot Act. In Europe, AML requirements are largely the result of countries transposing the 3rd European Union Money Laundering Directive (and preceding EU Money Laundering Directives) into local laws and regulations. We anticipate the passage of the 4th European Money Laundering Directive in 2014, which may add new AML requirements. Numerous other countries, such as Argentina, Australia, Canada and Mexico, have also enacted or proposed new or enhanced AML legislation and regulations applicable to American Express.  

The underpinnings of these laws and regulations are the efforts of each government to prevent the financial system from being used by criminals to hide their illicit proceeds and to impede terrorists ability to access and move funds used in support of terrorist activities. Among other things, these laws and regulations require  

52  

Table of Contents 

 financial institutions to establish AML programs that meet certain standards, including, in some instances, expanded reporting, particularly in the area of suspicious transactions, and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. Any errors, failures or delays in complying with federal, state or foreign AML and counter-terrorist financing laws could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties and forfeiture of significant assets or other enforcement actions.  

American Express has established and continues to maintain a Global Anti-Money Laundering Policy, designed to ensure that, at a minimum, American Express and all of its businesses are in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations related to AML and anti-terrorist financing initiatives. The American Express Global Anti-Money Laundering Policy requires that each American Express business maintains a compliance program that provides for a system of internal controls to ensure that appropriate due diligence and, when necessary, enhanced due diligence, including obtaining and maintaining appropriate documentation, is conducted at account opening and updated, as necessary, through the course of the customer relationship. The Global Anti-Money Laundering Policy is also designed to ensure there are appropriate methods of monitoring transactions and account relationships to identify potentially suspicious activity and reporting suspicious activity to governmental authorities in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. In addition, the American Express Global Anti-Money Laundering Policy requires the training of appropriate personnel with regard to AML and anti-terrorist financing issues and provides for independent testing to ensure that the Global Anti-Money Laundering Policy is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.  

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation  

The United States has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. The United States prohibits U.S. persons from engaging with individuals and entities identified as Specially Designated Nationals, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers. These prohibitions are administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and are typically known as the OFAC rules. The OFAC rules prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in financial transactions with or relating to the prohibited individual, entity or country, require the blocking of assets in which the individual, entity or country has an interest, and prohibit transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons) to such individual, entity or country. Blocked assets (e.g., property or bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. We maintain a global sanctions program designed to ensure compliance with OFAC requirements. Failure to comply with such requirements could subject us to serious legal and reputational consequences, including criminal penalties.  

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. Disclosure is generally required even where the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted outside the United States by non-U.S. affiliates in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under U.S. law.  

Since 2011, American Express Global Business Travel booked approximately 363 flights on Iran Air and 2 flights on Mahan Air for passengers. We had approximately $5,900 in gross revenues and negligible net profits attributable to these transactions. Although these transactions were permissible pursuant to certain exemptions from U.S. sanctions for travel-related transactions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, as amended, we do not intend to continue to engage in this activity. In addition, a travel company that may be considered an affiliate of ours, American Express Nippon Travel Agency, Inc. (Nippon Travel Agency), has informed us that during 2013 it obtained 21 visas from the Iranian embassy in Japan in connection with certain travel arrangements on behalf of clients. Nippon Travel Agency had approximately $150 in gross revenues and negligible net profits attributable to these transactions. Nippon Travel Agency has informed us that it intends to continue to engage in this activity so long as such activity is permitted under U.S. law.

Compensation Practices  

Our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve. In June 2010, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and the OTS jointly issued final guidance on sound incentive compensation policies that applies to all banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve, including bank holding companies, such as the Company, as well as all insured depository institutions, including Centurion Bank and AEBFSB. The final guidance sets forth three key principles for incentive compensation arrangements that are designed to help ensure that incentive compensation plans do not encourage excessive risk-taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of banking organizations. The three principles provide that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risks, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors. Any deficiencies in compensation practices of a banking institution that are identified by the Federal Reserve or other banking regulators in connection with its review of such organizations compensation practices may be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings, which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions. The final guidance provides that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk-management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.  

Additionally, in 2011, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the OTS, the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the National Credit Union Administration issued proposed rulemaking pursuant to Dodd-Frank on incentive-based compensation practices. Under the proposed rule, all financial institutions with total consolidated assets of $1 billion or more (such as the Company, Centurion Bank and AEBFSB) would be prohibited from offering incentive-based compensation arrangements that encourage inappropriate risk taking by offering excessive compensation or compensation that could lead the company to material financial loss. All covered institutions would be required to provide federal regulators with additional disclosures to determine compliance with the proposed rule and also to maintain policies and procedures to ensure compliance. Additionally, for covered institutions with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, such as the Company, the proposed rule requires that at least 50 percent of certain executive officers incentive-based compensation be deferred for a minimum of three years and provides for the adjustment of deferred payments to reflect actual losses or other measures of performance that become known during the deferral period. Moreover, the board of directors of a covered institution with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets must identify employees who have authority to expose an institution to substantial risk, evaluate and document the incentive-based compensation methods used to balance risk and financial rewards for the identified employees, and approve incentive-based compensation arrangements for those employees after appropriately considering other available methods for balancing risk and financial rewards. The form and timing of any final rule cannot be determined at this time.  

The scope and content of these policies and regulations on executive compensation are continuing to develop and are likely to continue evolving in the near future. It cannot be determined at this time whether compliance with such policies and regulations will adversely affect our ability to hire, retain and motivate key employees.  

Anti-Corruption  

We are subject to complex international and U.S. anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments. The FCPA makes it illegal to corruptly offer or provide anything of value to foreign government officials, political parties or political party officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or an improper advantage. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced by Department of Justice (DOJ). The FCPA also requires us to strictly comply with certain accounting and internal controls  

54  

Table of Contents 

 standards, which are enforced by the SEC. In recent years, DOJ and SEC enforcement of the FCPA has become more intense. The U.K. Bribery Act, which took effect in July 2011, also prohibits commercial bribery, and the receipt of a bribe, and makes it a corporate offense to fail to prevent bribery by an associated person, in addition to prohibiting improper payments to foreign government officials. Failure to comply with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other laws can expose us and/or individual employees to potentially severe criminal and civil penalties. The risk may be greater when we transact business, whether through subsidiaries or joint ventures or other partnerships, in countries with higher perceived levels of corruption. We have risk-based policies and procedures designed to detect and deter prohibited practices, provide specialized training, monitor our operations and payments, and investigate allegations of improprieties relating to transactions and the manner in which transactions are recorded. However, if our employees, contractors or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing our international operations, the Company, as well as individual employees, may face investigations or prosecutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS  

We derive a significant portion of our revenues from the use of our Card products, Travelers Cheques, travel and other financial products and services in countries outside the United States and continue to broaden the use of these products and services outside the United States. (For a discussion of our revenue by geographic region, see Note 25 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which you can find on pages 102-104 of our 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders and which is incorporated herein by reference.) Our revenues can be affected by political and economic conditions in these countries (including the availability of foreign exchange for the payment by the local Card issuer of obligations arising out of local Card Members spending outside such country, for the payment of Card bills by Card Members who are billed in a currency other than their local currency, and for the remittance of the proceeds of Travelers Cheque sales). Substantial and sudden devaluation of local Card Members currency can also affect their ability to make payments to the local issuer of the Card in connection with spending outside the local country.  

As a result of our foreign operations, we are exposed to the possibility that, because of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar may be realized in amounts greater or less than the U.S. dollar amounts at which they are currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Examples of transactions in which this may occur include the purchase by Card Members of goods and services in a currency other than the currency in which they are billed; the sale in one currency of a Travelers Cheque denominated in a second currency; and, in most instances, investments in foreign operations. These risks, unless properly monitored and managed, could have an adverse effect on our operations. For more information on how we manage risk relating to foreign exchange, see Risk Management  Market Risk Management Process on pages 45-46 of our 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  

SEGMENT INFORMATION AND CLASSES OF SIMILAR SERVICES

Certain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations.  

Distribution of Assets, Liabilities, and Shareholders Equity; Interest Rates and Interest Differential  

The following tables provide a summary of the Companys consolidated average balances including major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities along with an analysis of net interest earnings. Consolidated average balances, interest, and average yields are segregated between U.S. and non-U.S. offices. Assets, liabilities, interest income and interest expense are attributed to U.S. and non-U.S. based on location of the office recording such items.

 (d) Average yields for taxable investment securities have been calculated using amortized cost balances and do not include changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income. Average yield on non-taxable investment securities is calculated on a tax-equivalent basis using the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent.  

 (e) Amounts include (i) average equity securities balances, which are included in investment securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and (ii) the associated dividend income. The average yield on other assets has not been shown as it would not be meaningful.

 (a) Averages based on month end balances.  

 (b) Interest expense incurred on derivative instruments in qualifying hedging relationships has been reported along with the related interest expense incurred on the hedged debt instrument. In 2011, for long-term debt, interest expense also included income earned on forward points related to the Companys foreign exchange swaps. This income was $41 million and $89 million for U.S .and non-U.S. entities, respectively, and the average rates presented exclude the effects of forward points. For 2013 and 2012, the interest has been reclassified to other, net expenses.

Loans and Card Member Receivables Portfolios  

The following table presents gross loans, net of unearned income, and gross Card Member receivables by customer type segregated between U.S. and non-U.S., based on the domicile of the borrowers. Allowance for losses is presented beginning on page 71. Refer to Note 4 Accounts Receivable and Loans on page 72 and Note 5 Reserves for Losses on page 77 in the 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders for additional information.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) The increase in U.S. Card Member loans between 2009 and 2010 was due to the adoption of accounting standards related to transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs), which resulted in the consolidation of the American Express Credit Account Master Trust (the Lending Trust) beginning January 1, 2010.  

 (b) Represents loans to individual and small business consumers.  

 (c) Other loans primarily represent loans to merchants and a store card portfolio.  

 (d) Represents receivables from individual and small business charge card consumers.  

 (e) Represents receivables from corporate charge card clients.

Maturities and Sensitivities to Changes in Interest Rates  

The following table presents contractual maturities of loans and Card Member receivables by customer type and segregated between U.S. and non-U.S. borrowers, and distribution between fixed and floating interest rates for loans due after one year based upon the stated terms of the loan agreements.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Card Member loans have no stated maturity and are therefore included in the due within one year category. However, many of the Companys Card Members will revolve their balances, which may extend their repayment period beyond one year for balances due at December 31, 2013.  

 (b) Card Member receivables are immediately due upon receipt of Card Member statements and have no stated interest rate and are included within the due within one year category. Receivables due after one year represent modification programs classified as Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs), wherein the terms of a receivable have been modified for Card Members that are experiencing financial difficulties and a long-term concession (more than 12 months) has been granted to the borrower.  

 (c) Card Member and other loans due after one year primarily represent installment loans and approximately $116 million of TDRs.

Card Member Loan and Card Member Receivable Concentrations  

The following table presents the Companys exposure to any concentration of gross Card Member loans and Card Member receivables which exceeds 10 percent of total Card Member loans and Card Member receivables. Card Member loan and Card Member receivable concentrations are defined as Card Member loans and Card Member receivables due from multiple borrowers engaged in similar activities that would cause these borrowers to be impacted similarly to certain economic or other related conditions.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Refer to Note 22 Significant Credit Concentrations on page 99 in the 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders for additional information on concentrations, including exposure to the airline industry, and for a discussion of how the Company manages concentration exposures. Certain distinctions between categories require management judgment.  

 (b) Includes corporate charge card receivables of $788 million from financial institutions, $27 million from U.S. Government agencies and $13.6 billion from other corporate institutions.  

 (c) The Companys charge card products generally have no pre-set limit, and therefore are not reflected in unused credit available to Card Members.

Table of Contents 

Risk Elements  

The following table presents the amounts of non-performing loans and Card Member receivables that are either non-accrual, past due, or restructured, segregated between U.S. and non-U.S. borrowers. Past due loans are loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments. Restructured loans and Card Member receivables are those that meet the definition of TDR.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) The increase in non-performing loans between 2009 and 2010 was due to the adoption of accounting standards related to transfers of financial assets and consolidation of VIEs, which resulted in the consolidation of the Lending Trust beginning January 1, 2010. As a result of these changes, amounts as of December 31, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010 include impaired loans and receivables for both the American Express Issuance Trust (the Charge Trust) and the Lending Trust; correspondingly, 2009 amounts only include impaired loans and receivables for the Charge Trust and the sellers interest portion of the Lending Trust.  

 (b) The Companys policy is generally to cease accruing interest income once a related Card Member loan is 180 days past due at which time the Card Member loan is written off. The Company establishes loan loss reserves for estimated uncollectible interest receivable balances prior to write-off. For the U.S., as of December 31, 2009, these amounts primarily include certain Card Member loans placed with outside collection agencies.  

 (c) Represents modification programs classified as TDRs, wherein the terms of a loan or receivable have been modified for Card Members that are experiencing financial difficulties and a concession has been granted to the borrower. Such modifications to the loans and receivables primarily include (i) temporary interest rate reductions (possibly as low as zero percent, in which case the loan is characterized as non-accrual in the Companys TDR disclosures), (ii) placing the Card Member on a fixed payment plan not to exceed 60 months and (iii) suspending delinquency fees until the Card Member exits the modification program. Upon entering the modification program, the Card Members ability to make future purchases is either cancelled or in certain cases suspended until the Card Member successfully exits the modification program. In accordance with the modification agreement with the Card Member, loans revert back to the original contractual terms (including the contractual interest rate) when the Card Member exits the modification program, which is either (i) when all payments have been made in accordance with the modification agreement or (ii) when the Card Member defaults out of the modification program.

Impact of Non-performing Loans on Interest Income  

The following table presents the gross interest income for both non-accrual and restructured loans for 2013 that would have been recognized if such loans had been current in accordance with their original contractual terms, and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for only part of 2013. The table also presents the interest income related to these loans that was actually recognized for the period. These amounts are segregated between U.S. and non-U.S. borrowers.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) The Company determines the original effective interest rate as the interest rate in effect prior to the imposition of any penalty interest rate.  

Potential Problem Receivables  

This disclosure presents outstanding amounts as well as specific reserves for certain receivables where information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms. At December 31, 2013, the Company did not identify any potential problem loans or receivables within the Card Member loans and receivables portfolio that were not already included in Risk Elements above.  

Cross-border Outstandings  

Cross-border disclosure is based upon the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Councils (FFIEC) guidelines governing the determination of cross-border risk. The Company has adopted the FFIEC guidelines for its cross-border disclosure starting with 2009 reporting. FFIEC guidelines have been revised effective December 31, 2013, accordingly this disclosure has been revised to conform with the revised guidelines.  

The primary differences between the FFIEC and Guide 3 guidelines for reporting cross-border exposure are: i) the FFIEC methodology includes mark-to-market exposures of derivative assets which are excluded under Guide 3; and ii) investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries are included under FFIEC but excluded under Guide 3.  

The following table presents the aggregate amount of cross-border outstandings from borrowers or counterparties for each foreign country that exceed 1 percent of consolidated total assets for any of the periods reported below. Cross-border outstandings include loans, receivables, interest-bearing deposits with other banks, other interest-bearing investments and other monetary assets that are denominated in either dollars or other non-local currency.  

69  

Table of Contents 

The table separately presents the amounts of cross-border outstandings by type of borrower including Governments and official institutions, Banks and other financial institutions, Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFIs) and Other.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (a) Due to the revised FFIEC instructions issued by the Federal Reserve as well as system constraints, the exposure under the category of NBFIs has been included under the Other category for the years 2012 and 2011.  

 (b) Cross-border outstandings between 0.75 percent and 1.0 percent of consolidated total assets are included in Other Countries. For comparability, countries that meet the threshold for any year presented are included for all years. For all three periods, the countries included are Italy and Germany.  

 (c) Generally, all charge and credit cards have revocable lines of credit, and therefore, are not disclosed as cross-border commitments. Refer to loan concentrations on page 67 for amount of unused lines of credit.
