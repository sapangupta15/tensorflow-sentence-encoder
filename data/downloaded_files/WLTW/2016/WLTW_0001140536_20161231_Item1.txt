PART I.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

The Company

Willis Towers Watson was formed upon completion of the Merger on January 4, 2016, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 29, 2015, as amended on November 19, 2015 (the ‘Merger Agreement’), between Legacy Willis, Legacy Towers Watson, and Citadel Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis formed for the purpose of facilitating this transaction (‘Merger Sub’). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Towers Watson with Towers Watson continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Willis. 

Immediately following the Merger, Legacy Willis effected (i) a consolidation (i.e., a reverse stock split under Irish law) of Willis ordinary shares whereby every 2.6490 Legacy Willis ordinary shares were consolidated into one Willis Towers Watson ordinary share (the ‘Consolidation’) and (ii) an amendment to its Constitution and other organizational documents to change its name from Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company to Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company. 

We trace our history to 1828, and are a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth.

We continue to integrate Willis and Towers Watson while creating a unified platform for global growth, including positioning the Company to leverage our mutual distribution strength to enhance market penetration, expand our global footprint and create a strong platform for further innovation. The fully integrated Company will have a more comprehensive offering of services and solutions to provide to clients across four business segments: Human Capital and Benefits; Corporate Risk and Broking; Investment, Risk and Reinsurance; and Exchange Solutions. 

Our clients operate on a global and local scale in a multitude of businesses and industries throughout the world and generally range in size from large, major multinational corporations to middle-market domestic and international companies. Our clients include many of the world’s leading corporations, including approximately 88% of the Fortune Global 500 companies and 85% of the Fortune 1000. We also advise more than three-quarters of the world’s leading insurance companies. We work with major corporations, emerging growth companies, governmental agencies and not-for-profit institutions in a wide variety of industries, with many of our client relationships spanning decades. No one client accounted for a significant concentration of revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. We place insurance with approximately 2,500 insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for a significant concentration of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2016, 2015 or 2014.

General Information

Willis Towers Watson is a leading global advisory, broking and solutions company that helps clients around the world turn risk into a path for growth. Willis Towers Watson has more than 41,000 employees and services clients in more than 140 countries and territories. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of 

5

capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. Our unique perspective allows us to see the critical intersections between talent, assets and ideas - the dynamic formula that drives business performance. 

We offer clients a broad range of services to help them to identify and control their risks, and to enhance business performance by improving their ability to attract, retain and engage a talented workforce. Our risk control services range from strategic risk consulting (including providing actuarial analysis), to a variety of due diligence services, to the provision of practical on-site risk control services (such as health and safety or property loss control consulting), as well as analytical and advisory services (such as hazard modeling and reinsurance optimization studies). We assist clients in planning how to manage incidents or crises when they occur. These services include contingency planning, security audits and product tampering plans. We help our clients enhance their business performance by delivering consulting services, technology and solutions that help organizations anticipate, identify and capitalize on emerging opportunities in human capital management as well as investment advice to help our clients develop disciplined and efficient strategies to meet their investment goals. 

As an insurance broker, we act as an intermediary between our clients and insurance carriers by advising our clients on their risk management requirements, helping clients determine the best means of managing risk and negotiating and placing insurance with insurance carriers through our global distribution network. We operate the largest private Medicare exchange in the United States (‘U.S.’). Through this exchange and those for active employees, we help our clients move to a more sustainable economic model by capping and controlling the costs associated with healthcare benefits. 

We are not an insurance company, and therefore we do not underwrite insurable risks for our own account. 

We derive the majority of our revenues from either commissions or fees for brokerage or consulting services. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Commission levels generally follow the same trend as premium levels as they are derived from a percentage of the premiums paid by the insureds. Fluctuations in these premiums charged by the insurance carriers can therefore have a direct and potentially material impact on our results of operations. Our fees for consulting services are spread across a variety of complementary businesses that generally remain steady during times of uncertainty. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change. 

We and our colleagues serve a diverse base of clients ranging in size from large, major multinational corporations to middle-market companies in a variety of industries, public institutions, and individual clients. Many of our client relationships span decades. We work with major corporations, emerging growth companies, governmental agencies and not-for-profit institutions in a wide variety of industries.

We believe we are one of only a few global advisory, broking and solutions companies in the world possessing the global operating presence, broad product expertise and extensive distribution network necessary to meet effectively the global needs of many of our clients.

Below are our revenues and long-lived assets by legal entity for Ireland, our country of domicile, countries with significant concentrations, and all other foreign countries for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

Business Strategy

Willis Towers Watson sees that a unified approach to people and risk can be a path to growth for our clients. Our integrated teams bring together our understanding of risk strategies and market analytics. This helps clients around the world to achieve their objectives.

6

We operate in attractive markets - both growing and mature - with a diversified platform across geographies, industries, segments and lines of business. We aim to become the premier advisory, broking and solutions company of choice globally. We design and deliver solutions that manage risk, optimize benefits, cultivate talent, and expand the power of capital to protect and strengthen institutions and individuals. We also help organizations improve performance through effective people, risk and financial management by focusing on providing human capital and financial consulting services.

 We believe we can achieve this by: 

•Delivering a powerful client proposition with an integrated global platform. Our highly complementary offerings provide comprehensive advice, analytics, specialty capabilities and solutions covering benefits, exchange solutions, brokerage and advisory, risk and capital management; and talent and rewards; 

•Leveraging our combined distribution strength and global footprint to enhance market penetration and provide a platform for further innovation; and

•Underpinning this growth through continuous operational improvement initiatives that help make us more effective and efficient and drive cost synergies. We do this by: 

◦continuing to modernize the way we run our business to better serve our clients, enabling the skills of our staff, and lowering our costs of doing business; 

◦making the necessary changes to our processes, our IT, our real estate and our workforce locations; and 

◦targeting and delivering identified, highly achievable cost savings as a direct consequence of the Merger. 

We care as much about how we work as we do about the impact that we make. This means commitment to shared values, a framework that guides how we run our business and serve clients.

Through these strategies we aim to accelerate revenue, cash flow, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (‘EBITDA’), and earnings growth, and generate compelling returns for investors, by delivering tangible revenue growth and capitalizing on the identified cost synergies.

Principal Services

In 2016, we began managing our business across four integrated reportable operating segments. As a result, the Company has changed the way it manages and reports segment revenues and operating income, resulting in a change in the Company’s reportable segments from eight reportable segments, formerly known as Willis International; Willis North America; Willis Capital, Wholesale & Reinsurance; Willis GB; Towers Watson Benefits; Towers Watson Exchange Solutions; Towers Watson Risk and Financial Services; and Towers Watson Talent and Rewards, into four reportable segments: Human Capital and Benefits; Corporate Risk and Broking; Investment, Risk and Reinsurance; and Exchange Solutions. Below are the percentages of revenues generated by each segment for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

(i)Figures have been recast into the new segment structure and do not include pro forma segment revenues from Legacy Towers Watson. For pro forma segment information, see our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 14, 2016.

The average number of employees by segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 are approximated below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Human Capital and Benefits 

The Willis Towers Watson Human Capital & Benefits (‘HCB’) segment provides an array of advice, broking, solutions and software for employee benefit plans, the human resources (‘HR’) organization and the management teams of our clients.  

HCB is the largest segment of the Company, generating approximately 41% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. Organized into four primary offerings - Retirement; Health & Benefits; Talent & Rewards; and Technology and Administration Solutions, the segment is focused on addressing our clients’ people and risk needs to help them take on the challenges of operating in a global marketplace. 

HCB is strengthened with teams of international consultants that provide support in each of these areas to the global headquarters of multinational clients and their foreign subsidiaries. 

Retirement — The Retirement business provides actuarial support, plan design, and administrative services for traditional pension and retirement savings plans. Our colleagues help our clients assess the costs and risks of retirement plans on cash flow, earnings and the balance sheet, the effects of changing workforce demographics on their retirement plans and retiree benefit adequacy and security. We offer clients a full range of integrated retirement consulting services to meet the needs of all types of employers - including those that continue to offer defined benefit plans and those that are reexamining their retirement benefit strategies. We bring a particular in-depth data analysis and perspective to their decision process, because we have tracked the retirement designs of the largest public companies around the world over many years. 

For clients that want to outsource some or all of their pension plan management, we offer integrated solutions that combine investment consulting, pension administration, core actuarial services, and communication and change management assistance. 

Our retirement consulting relationships are generally long-term in nature, and client retention rates for this business are high. A significant portion of the revenues in this business is from recurring work, with multi-year contracts that are driven by the heavily regulated nature of employee benefit plans and our clients’ annual needs for these services. Revenues for the Retirement business are somewhat seasonal, as much of our work pertains to calendar-year plan administration and reporting and compliance related to the completion of pension plan valuations; thus, the first quarter of the fiscal year is typically HCB’s strongest quarter. Major revenue growth drivers in this business include changes in regulations, capital market conditions, increased global demand and increased market share. 

Health and Benefits — The Health & Benefits (‘H&B’) business provides plan management consulting, broking and administration across the full spectrum of health and group benefit programs, including medical, dental, disability, life and other coverage. As a result of the Merger, our H&B reach extends from small/mid-market clients to large market clients, across the full geographic footprint of the Company, and to most industries. We can address our clients’ insured needs in more than 160 countries. 

Our consultants help clients make strategic decisions on topics such as optimizing program spend; evaluating emerging coverage options (including publicly-subsidized health insurance exchanges and private exchanges in the U.S.); and dealing with above-inflation-rate increases in healthcare costs. In addition to our consulting services, we manage a number of collective purchasing initiatives, such as pharmacy and stop-loss, that allow employers to realize greater value from third-party service providers than they can achieve on their own. 

With Global Benefits Solutions, our suite of global services supporting medical, dental and risk (life, accident and disability) programs, we have a tailored offering for multinationals. That offering includes a flexible set of ready-made offerings, proven technology, efficient operational structure and an integrated approach to service delivery that translates to a globally consistent, high-quality experience for our clients. 

8

Finally, H&B supports OneExchange Active, our private health insurance exchange for active employees. This offering is integrated with other health insurance exchange offerings, OneExchange Retiree and OneExchange Access, which are offered within the Exchange Solutions segment. 

Talent & Rewards — Our Talent & Rewards (‘T&R’) business covers three areas of specialty: Executive Compensation (‘EC’); Rewards, Talent & Communication (‘RTC’); and Data, Surveys and Technology (‘DST’). T&R provides advice, data, software and products to address clients’ total rewards and talent issues. T&R has operations across the globe, including centralized software development and analytics teams that support the efficient delivery of services to clients. 

Within our EC practice, we advise our clients’ management and boards of directors on all aspects of executive pay programs, including base pay, annual bonuses, long-term incentives, perquisites and other benefits. Our focus is on aligning pay plans with the organization’s business strategy and driving desired performance. 

RTC offers services focused on designing and implementing rewards and talent management programs and processes which help companies attract and deploy talent, engage them over time, manage and reward their performance, develop their skills, provide them with relevant career paths, communicate with them and manage organizational change initiatives. 

Our DST offerings include market benchmarking data, employee insight and listening tools, talent assessment tools and services, and HR software to help companies administer and manage their talent management and reward programs and analyze talent trends. 

Revenues for the T&R business are partly seasonal in nature, with a meaningful amount of heightened activity in the second half of the calendar year during the annual compensation, benefits and survey cycles. While T&R enjoys long-term relationships with many clients, work in several practices is often project-based and can be sensitive to economic changes. The business benefits from regulatory changes affecting our clients that require strategic advice, program changes and communication such as CEO pay ratio disclosure and Fair Labor Standards Act changes in the U.S., by which swaths of employees will be newly-eligible for overtime pay. Additional areas of growth for T&R include evolving views on effective individual performance measurement and management, focus on workforce productivity improvements and labor cost reductions, globalization and digitization of the workforce, merger and acquisition (‘M&A’) activity, technology-enabled approaches for measuring and understanding workforce engagement, and the opportunity to leverage HR software to improve the design, management and implementation of HR processes and programs. 

Technology and Administration Solutions — Our Technology and Administration Solutions (‘TAS’) business provides benefits outsourcing services to hundreds of clients across multiple industries. Our TAS team focuses on clients outside of the U.S. where our services are supported by high quality administration teams using robust technology platforms. We have high client retention rates, and we are the leading administrator among the 200 largest pension plans in the United Kingdom (‘U.K.’), as well as a leader in Germany. 

For both our defined benefit and defined contribution administration services, we use highly-automated processes and web technology to enable benefit plan members to access and manage their records, perform self-service functions and improve their understanding of their benefits. Our technology also provides trustees and HR teams with timely management information to monitor activity and service levels and reduce administration costs. 

Corporate Risk and Broking 

Our Corporate Risk & Broking (‘CRB’) segment provides a broad range of risk advice, insurance brokerage and consulting services to clients worldwide ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations. We deliver integrated global solutions tailored to client needs and underpinned by data and analytics. 

CRB generated approximately 32% of Willis Towers Watson revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, and places more than $20 billion of premium into the insurance markets, annually. 

CRB operates as an integrated global team comprising both functional and geographic leadership. In addition there are five global offerings, which aim to leverage capabilities across geographies, including Property and Casualty, Financial Lines, Transport, Affinity and Facultative. In these operations, we have extensive specialized experience handling diverse lines of coverage, including complex insurance programs. A key objective is to assist clients in reducing their overall cost of risk. 

Property and Casualty — Property and Casualty provides property and liability insurance brokerage services across a wide range of industries including construction, real estate, healthcare and natural resources. Our construction practice provides risk management advice and brokerage services for a wide range of international construction activities. Clients of the construction practice include contractors, project owners, project managers, consultants and financiers. Our natural resources practice 

9

encompasses the oil and gas, mining, power and utilities sectors; and provides services including property damage, offshore construction liability and other services to global clients. 

Financial Lines — Financial Lines specializes in brokerage services for financial, political and credit risks. Our clients include financial institutions and professional services firms from around the globe that require coverage for areas ranging from business risks, like trade credit, directors and officers and medical malpractice, to external threats, like cyberattacks and terrorism. 

Transport — Transport provides specialist expertise to the transportation industry and aerospace, marine and inspace practices. Our aerospace business provides insurance brokerage and risk management services to aerospace clients worldwide, including the world’s leading airlines, aircraft manufacturers, air cargo handlers and other airport and general aviation companies. Our marine business provides insurance brokerage services, including hull, cargo, protection and indemnity and general marine liabilities. Our marine clients include ship owners, ship builders, logistics operations, port authorities, traders and shippers. The specialist inspace team is also prominent in providing insurance and risk management services to the space industry. 

Affinity — Affinity arranges the insurance products and services for our client partners to offer to their customers, employees or members alongside, or in addition to, their principal business activities. Products include: extended warranties, accidental damage of personal mobile devices, creditor payment protection, accident and health and personal lines. 

Facultative — Facultative serves as a broker or intermediary for insurance companies looking to arrange reinsurance solutions across classes of risk, which enable them to deliver differentiated outcomes to their direct insureds, which in many situations are also clients of the wider Willis Towers Watson business. The facultative business also works closely with our treaty reinsurance business to structure reinsurance solutions that deliver capital and strategic benefits to insurance company clients. 

Investment, Risk and Reinsurance 

The Willis Towers Watson Investment, Risk and Reinsurance (‘IRR’) segment applies a sophisticated approach to risk which helps clients free up capital and manage investment complexity. The segment works closely with investors, reinsurers and insurers to manage the equation between risk and return. Blending advanced analytics with deep institutional knowledge, IRR helps identify new opportunities to maximize performance. IRR provides investment consulting services and insurance specific services and solutions through reserves opinions, software, ratemaking, usage-based insurance, risk underwriting, and reinsurance broking. 

This segment is our third largest segment and generated approximately 19% of revenues for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2016. With approximately 80% of the revenues for this segment split between North America and the U.K., this segment includes the following businesses and offerings: Willis Re; Risk Consulting and Software; Investment; Wholesale Insurance Broking; Portfolio and Underwriting Services; and Capital Markets & Advisory. 

Willis Re — Willis Re provides reinsurance industry clients with an understanding of how risk affects capital and financial performance and advises on the best ways to manage related outcomes. We operate this business on a global basis and provide a complete range of transactional capabilities, including, in conjunction with Capital Markets & Advisory, a wide variety of capital markets-based products to both insurance and reinsurance companies. Our services are underpinned by modeling, financial analysis and risk management advice. 

Risk Consulting and Software — Risk Consulting and Software is a global business that provides advice and technology solutions to the insurance industry, as well as to corporate clients with respect to their insurance programs. We leverage our industry experience, strategic perspective and analytical skills to help clients measure and manage risk and capital, improve business performance and create a sustainable competitive advantage. Our services include software and technology, risk and capital management, products and pricing, financial and regulatory reporting, financial and capital modeling, M&A, outsourcing and business management. 

Investment — Investment provides advice to improve investment outcomes for asset owners using a broad and sophisticated framework for managing risk. We provide coordinated investment advice and solutions to some of the world’s largest pension funds and institutional investors based on our expertise in risk assessment, asset-liability modeling, strategic asset allocation policy setting, manager selection and investment execution.  

Wholesale Insurance Broking — Wholesale Insurance Broking provides wholesale and specialist broking services to retail brokers worldwide, through Willis Towers Watson and London based specialist broker Miller Insurance Services LLP.  

Portfolio and Underwriting Services — Portfolio and Underwriting Services, with operations in London and North America, brings together our existing set of Managing General Agent underwriting activities for purposes of accelerating their future development.

10

entities in product marketing and distribution, risk underwriting and selection, claims management and other general administrative responsibilities.  

Capital Markets & Advisory — Capital Markets & Advisory, with offices in New York, London, Hong Kong and Sydney, provides investment banking services to companies involved in the insurance and reinsurance industries for a broad array of merger and acquisition transactions as well as capital markets products, including acting as underwriter for primary issuances, operating a secondary insurance-linked securities trading desk and engaging in strategic advisory work. 

Exchange Solutions 

The Willis Towers Watson Exchange Solutions (‘ES’) segment provides primary medical and ancillary benefit exchange and outsourcing services to active employees and retirees across both the group and individual markets. ES services individual populations via its ‘group to individual’ technology platform, which tightly integrates patented call routing technology, an efficient quoting and enrollment engine, a Customer Relationship Management system and comprehensive insurance carrier connectivity. This segment also delivers group benefit exchanges and full outsourcing solutions serving the active employees of employers across the United States. ES uses Software as a Service (‘SaaS’)-based technology and related services to deliver consumer-driven healthcare and reimbursement accounts, including health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements, flexible spending accounts and other consumer-directed accounts. 

A significant portion of the revenues in this segment is recurring in nature, driven by either the commissions from the policies we sell, or from long-term service contracts with our clients that typically range from three to five years. Revenues across this segment may be seasonal, driven by the magnitude and timing of client transition activities, and we typically increase our membership levels significantly effective January 1, after calendar year-end benefits elections. 

ES generated approximately 8% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. ES provides services across four integrated or related offerings to customers primarily in the U.S., including Retiree & Access Exchanges; Active Exchanges; Technology and Administration Solutions; and Consumer-Directed Accounts. 

Retiree & Access Exchanges — This business provides solutions through a proprietary technology platform, OneExchange Retiree, which enables our employer clients to transition their retirees to individual, defined contribution health plans that provide individuals with a tax-free allowance or contribution to spend on healthcare services at an annual cost that the employer controls, as opposed to group-based, defined benefit health plans that provide groups of individuals with healthcare benefits at uncertain annual costs. 

Active Exchanges — This business is focused on delivering group benefit exchanges, serving the active employees of employers across the United States. Using our proprietary BenefitConnect or Bright Choices exchange platforms, combined with our expertise in creating high-performing benefit plan designs, we believe we are well-positioned to help our clients simplify their benefits delivery, while lowering the total costs of benefits and related administration. We have relationships with more than 400 broker partners to access and service the small to mid-size group market and offer both fully-insured and self-insured exchanges to meet the needs of our employer clients. 

Technology and Administration Solutions — Through our proprietary BenefitConnect technology, this business provides a broad suite of health and welfare outsourcing services as well as decision support and modeling tools for pension users. With our disciplined approach to customer service, we offer cost-effective, high-touch service to hundreds of clients across many industries. 

Consumer-Directed Accounts — This business uses its SaaS-based technology and related services to deliver consumer-driven healthcare and reimbursement accounts, including health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements and other consumer-directed accounts. 

Competition 

We face competition in all fields in which we operate, based on global capability, product breadth, innovation, quality of service and price. We compete with Accenture plc, Aon plc, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., Brown & Brown Inc., Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Robert Half International Inc., as well as with numerous specialty, regional and local firms. Marsh & McLennan Companies and Aon plc are the two other major providers of global risk management services. Competition for business is intense in all of our business lines and in every insurance market, and in some business lines Marsh & McLennan Companies and Aon plc have greater market share than we do.

Competition on premium rates has also exacerbated the pressures caused by a continuing reduction in demand in some classes of business. For example, rather than purchase additional insurance through brokers, some insureds have been retaining a greater proportion of their risk portfolios than previously. Industrial and commercial companies increasingly rely upon their 

11

own subsidiary insurance companies, known as captive insurance companies, self-insurance pools, risk retention groups, mutual insurance companies and other mechanisms for funding their risks, rather than buy insurance. Additional competitive pressures arise from the entry of new market participants, such as banks, accounting firms and insurance carriers themselves, offering risk management or transfer services. 

The human capital and risk management consulting industries are highly competitive. We believe there are significant barriers to entry, and we have developed competitive advantages in providing HR consulting and risk management consulting services. We face strong competition from several sources. 

Our principal competitors in the pension consulting industry are Mercer HR Consulting (a Marsh & McLennan company) and Aon plc. Beyond these large players, the global HR consulting industry is highly fragmented. 

Our major competitors in the insurance consulting and software industry include Milliman, Oliver Wyman (a Marsh & McLennan company), the big four accounting firms and SunGard. Aon, Buck Consultants (a Xerox Company), Connextions (a United Healthcare company), Mercer (a Marsh & McLennan company), Automatic Data Processing and Fidelity are our primary competitors in the insurance exchange industry. With the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, we also compete with the public exchanges currently run by the U.S. federal and state governments. We now compete with providers of account-based health plans and consumer-directed benefits such as WageWorks and HealthEquity. 

The market for our services is subject to change as a result of economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. Regulatory and legislative actions, along with continuously evolving technological developments, will likely have the greatest impact on the overall market for our exchange products. We believe the primary factors in selecting an HR consulting or risk management services firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs. With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution, a provider’s capability in delivering a broad number of configurations to serve various population segments and financing options, and an innovative service delivery model and platform. For our traditional consulting and risk management services and the rapidly evolving exchange products, we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors. 

Regulation 

Our business activities are subject to legal requirements and governmental and quasi-governmental regulatory supervision in all countries in which we operate. Also, such regulations may require individual or company licensing to conduct our business activities. While these requirements may vary from location to location, they are generally designed to protect our clients by establishing minimum standards of conduct and practice, particularly regarding the provision of advice and product information, as well as financial criteria. We are also subject to data privacy regulations in many countries. Our most significant regulatory regions are described below: 

United States 

Our activities in connection with insurance brokerage services within the United States are subject to regulation and supervision by state authorities. Although the scope of regulation and form of supervision may vary from state to state, insurance laws in the United States are often complex and generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities in adopting regulations and supervising regulated activities. That supervision generally includes the licensing of insurance brokers and agents and the regulation of the handling and investment of client funds held in a fiduciary capacity. Our continuing ability to provide insurance brokerage in the states in which we currently operate is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated by the regulatory authorities in each of these states. Additionally, some of our private exchange activities are overseen by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services. 

Certain of our activities are governed by other regulatory bodies, such as investment and securities licensing authorities. Our activities in connection with investment services within the United States are subject to regulation and supervision at both the federal and state levels. At the federal level, certain of our operating subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC through the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers’ Act of 1940; and by the Department of Labor through the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or ERISA. In connection with the SEC regulations, we are required to file certain reports, and are subject to various marketing restrictions, among other requirements. In connection with ERISA regulations, we are restricted in actions we can take for plans for which we serve as fiduciaries, among other matters. Our U.S. investment activities are also subject to certain state regulatory schemes. 

12

Our Capital Markets & Advisory business operates through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Willis Securities, Inc., a U.S.-registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA/SIPC, primarily in connection with investment banking services and advising on alternative risk financing transactions. 

Our activities in connection with Third Party Administrator (‘TPA’) services in the United States are also subject to regulation and supervision by many state authorities. Licensing requirements and supervision vary from state to state. As with insurance brokerage services, our continuing ability to provide these services in states that regulate our activities is dependent upon our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these states. 

European Union 

In 2005, the European Union Insurance Mediation Directive introduced rules to enable insurance and reinsurance intermediaries to operate and provide services within each member state of the European Union (‘E.U.’) on a basis consistent with the E.U. single market and customer protection aims. Each E.U. member state in which we operate is required to ensure that the insurance and reinsurance intermediaries resident in their country are registered with a statutory body in that country and that each intermediary meets professional requirements in relation to their competence, good repute, professional indemnity cover and financial capacity. The E.U. has been in the process of updating the Insurance Mediation Directive. Various E.U. bodies are working on creating a replacement to the Insurance Mediation Directive called the Insurance Distribution Directive. The current timetable would require all E.U. member states to make the Insurance Distribution Directive national law by February 2018.  

In addition, Capital Markets & Advisory provides advice on securities or investments in the European Union and Australia through our U.K. wholly-owned subsidiary, Willis Capital Markets & Advisory Limited, which is authorized and regulated by the FCA (as defined below). 

Willis Towers Watson is also subject to the new E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’), which goes into effect in May 2018. The GDPR is a new, comprehensive regime covering data protection.  

United Kingdom 

In the United Kingdom, our business is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’). The FCA has a wide range of rule-making, investigatory and enforcement powers, and conducts monitoring visits to assess our compliance with regulatory requirements. 

The FCA has a sole strategic objective: to ensure that the relevant markets function well. Its operational objectives are to: secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; protect and enhance the integrity of the U.K. financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers. The FCA has powers in product intervention. For instance, it can instruct firms to withdraw or amend misleading financial promotions. A U.K. exit from the E.U. may cause an increase in regulations in the U.K. 

Other 

Capital Markets & Advisory, through its affiliate, Willis Capital Markets & Advisory (Hong Kong) Limited, is licensed to conduct certain securities-related activities, and is subject to regulation by the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. Certain of our entities that undertake pension scheme management are subject to MiFID (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) and are authorized and regulated by certain financial services authorities in countries such as Sweden, Ireland, the Netherlands and the U.K. 

All companies carrying on similar activities in a given jurisdiction are subject to regulations which are not dissimilar to the requirements for our operations in the United States and United Kingdom. We do not consider these regulatory requirements as adversely affecting our competitive position.
